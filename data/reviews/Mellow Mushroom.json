{"text":"I've been here several times. Beer selection is amazing. They have a great happy hour - probably one of the best on Mill. Pizza is really tasty. I think my issue with this place is their non-pizza food items. First time I ate there, got the Caesar salad - definitely not what I was expecting and I was not a fan. Also ordered the \"soft\" pretzel with salt - never again. Holy salt and hold the soft. The next time I ate there, I got the spinach artichoke dip, which was tasty while hot, but if you decide to not gobble it down, the texture gets kinda funky as it cools. Also ordered the Capri - mozzarella, basil and balsamic. Probably my favorite non-pizza item but it was still lacking something - more balsamic or some crackers... Idk. All in all... I will be back at least for drinks and happy hour. Jury is still out on the food."}
{"text":"I placed an order for carry out and clumsily dropped the entire pizza as I walked out the door. The employee and manager made me a new pizza, free of charge, and I got to keep the dropped pizza (that hadn't touched the ground, just lost all of its veggies). 

I sincerely appreciated the thoughtfulness of the staff after I proved to be such a bumbling idiot."}
{"text":"Always have a great time when we go to mellow! Bartenders are awesome, know what we like and have it ready!"}
{"text":"My wife took me here to look at a possible retirement party spot.  Wow, this is not just a spot for that.  From the moment we walked in, the smiles, the laughter, the fun oozing from every corner, every decor - even the light fixtures, you can't help having a smile on your face.  Next came the menu and the beer list.  So many choices and ones I haven't seen any where in Phoenix (hint: Any of the Deschutes beers), all on tap no less.  Then the food, appetizers and pizza, the best I've tasted in forever.  The staff; our waitress, McKenna was fun, attentive, and made us feel even more welcome.  After thoroughly enjoying a relaxing meal, the General Manager came over ( Matt Bertrand), just check up on us.  After explaining our retirement plan, he sat down with us and gave a run down on how we could do it.  I could go on and on, and this place deserves all the accolades, however I'll just say, this will be the place to have our party.  And, we have just found our new favorite place for a night out!"}
{"text":"I came on a Monday night. All beers were 3.79. I think they had a huge selection. I did not get the chance to try the pizza, so I cannot comment on that. It was a pretty cool spot to hang out in for a while."}
{"text":"West Coast Pizza. Lot's of dough, no flavor that lays like a rock in your stomach. 
Never ever had a calzone that did not have Ricotta Cheese in it before. Here it is just lots of Dough, low quality Cheese and crappy Sauce. That is not a Calzone.
They must have been smoking the Mushrooms when they made this recipe and called it a Calzone."}
{"text":"OK as I have mentioned in other reviews I am new to Tempe and am searching for good gluten free foods.  Pizza in particular.

We called and had pizzas delivered.  The only downside was that it took about 40 minutes to get it, but hey......it was a Saturday night, what did I expect?!!

Was it worth the wait?  Yes, absolutely. 

I went with the gluten free gourmet white pizza (olive oil and garlic base with sun dried tomatoes, provolone, mozzarella, feta, tomatoes and onions) for kicks I added bacon.  When I opened the box it looked ok, but the smell made my mouth water!  I could barely wait to get it on a plate.  At first I was not sure about the crust, but it was REALLY good!  The crust is vegan and unlike any gluten free crust I have had.  Great texture and flavor.  This pizza was so good I ate the entire thing........granted it is a 12\" one, but man!

I WILL be ordering this again soon.  I am anxious to try the other flavors, especially the Kosmic Karma.

Well done Mellow Mushroom!

PS - if you are thinking about this, please be sure to read their policy on their gluten free pizzas.  They take that extra step to make sure that it is not contaminated from the other things in the kitchen.  We all know that in a kitchen that serves gluten items, you can't completely avoid cross-contamination, but the steps they take make me feel better about eating here."}
{"text":"Best pizza in North Phoenix, hands down. I've gone here dozens of times due to the great service and energetic atmosphere. They have a really nice bar area with about 4 large TV's, so it's a great place to enjoy quality food and watch a game with some buddies. 

Though the pizza is fantastic, their salads/appetizers/etc. are mediocre and overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend going here if you're not going for a pizza/hoagie/calzone. A medium pizza and a couple of drinks is plenty of food for 2 and it'll leave you both satisfied. Their lunch prices are awesome as well, to make a note. 

Only complaints I can think of are that the service sometimes is a little slow, and that the food is inconsistent depending on when you go. 

Just a tip: Try the Kosmic Karma, most underrated pie there. It's amazing. Throw some jalape√±os on there and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews before visiting for the first time.  With hesitation, we gave it a shot and loved it.  The pizza had a delicious whole wheat dough and was loaded with fresh ingredients.  The crust is hand tossed to a perfect density.  It does take longer to cook in the brick oven so don't come here if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"I tried the normal pizza which was the Margaret's, it tastes good and i recommend everyone to eat from this Restaurant."}
{"text":"Just got the check and wanted to write a quick review. Our server Caleb, was awesome and made my first experience with Mellow Mushroom one I will not forget about. I would recommend this place to anyone as long as Caleb is still working here. I'm very big on recognition and he deserves all of it."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! The crust is amazing. I recommend the magical mystery tour with chicken and a frosty local draft beer. Will be back."}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've had! My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before our movie. Our server Nick along with the rest of the staff made sure we received exceptional and fast service. We could not be happier with our experience! Thank you!"}
{"text":"One of the best Pizza places ever ...
Employees and manager are the best
We will return a couples tines a month for sure"}
{"text":"Our server Anthony was awesome!  His knowledge of beers & menu was very helpful. Good food and great Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Today very bad service, waited for 25min to be seated watching several empty tables. Had to talk to manager. After seated pizza took 40min to be ready. Unfortunately this is the last time we come here."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to a place called Mellow Mushroom on Mill Ave.  It was a very clean and friendly atmosphere; many families were there with their children.   Our waitress was very energetic and kind.  She made conversation with us and was a great waitress.  The service was fast. They checked on us to see if we needed any more water or to ask how the food was.
 Mellow Mushroom had really good food. We got half barbeque chicken pizza and the other half had olives onions and mushrooms.  Both types of the pizza had great flavor.  The food was on the expensive side, but the quality matched the price.  I would recommend eating there if you are in the area.
 The restraint itself was an upbeat place.  It was lively and all the waiters and waitresses dressed very casual.  The surroundings in the restraint matched the surroundings of Mill Ave; young people with there own type of personality went there.  They are unique with artwork on the walls."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place -- first time we have left a restaurant in a couple years.  I'll start with this place is NOISY! (think Chucky Cheese noisy).  We asked to be seated outside and were led to a tiny table that was dirty.  The hostess came to wipe it off and then left it wet with drops of water falling through the table slats onto our legs.  Add to that it was still sticky with what smelled like spilled beer.  We glanced at the menu which seemed expensive for pizza but I guess we will never know as we won't be going back.  The clincher was when my husband and I looked up a patron's a$$ at the outside bar was about 24 inches from our heads.  Might be an OK place to drink but not for a relaxing dinner."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE pizza. After waiting to get served forever, the pizza came out with a pound of grease on top. It was gooey and disgusting. I couldn't even take a bite of it.  Needless to say, I do not recommend this place at all. If I could eat there for free, I still wouldn't even go. Save yourself the trouble."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night, seated immediately on a cold night outside with heaters...was a very good experience.  Wife had an Appletini and a Pomegranate martini and were awesome.  I opted for the root beer, house made and yes it was very good.  We split a pizza, meat on one side for me and olives on the other for her-was a very good pizza.  Would definitely recommend.....oh and the cookies for desert was awesome."}
{"text":"Waiter staff excellent. Manager comped half of our pizza when it came out incorrectly and gave us the correct order. Very generous! Pizza and salad was amazing. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and appetizers, the food was great overall. The service, however, was very slow. I'm not sure if it was the kitchen or the servers or a combination of both. We waited after seating and ordered appetizers, then waited awhile and then wait more. Our server did not take our meal order until our appetizers arrived. This was fine but it was a bit awkward sitting around with our menus in front of us and no one checking on us for an extended amount of time. Overall, the service was slow and it wasn't extremely busy. Decor was a little weird but the atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Overpriced and verrrrrrrrrry slow.  The pizza is good, the beer selection is fantastic, and the people are nice. Two big problems though:  1.  The pizza is much more expensive than comparable pizza elsewhere.  Beer prices are steep too.  2. Both times I've been here the pizza took far too long. I won't be coming back. If you value your time and money you'll stay away too."}
{"text":"So I am writing this review royally pissed off.  We (me and a ton of my co-workers) tend to go to Mellow Mushroom due to the proximty of where we work.  They are frequently featured on Groupon for $10 buys a $20 coupon.  We only get a short break for lunch so normally will do the to go option and have used the groupon and had the remainder put on a gift card to use later on in the week.  I just had this option refused for the first time by the 'general manager' and left the restaurant without my lunch.  Now I've got to cancel this groupon as I'm never going to spend $20 in food at one time on myself and won't be going to mellow mushroom again-horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday.. Sunday morning with my family and was served by Ashley, had a wondeful experience and she was very attentive and was highly knowledgable of the menu. Being first time patrons I was highly impressed with how easily she guided us through your menu options. We decided on the Maui Waui on her recommendation and it was declicious. Im the type of costumer that always chooses the easiest thing off the beer menu, but Ashley gave us a few recommendations of her personal list and I actually tried the seasonal and it was surprisingly good. We will be back soon! Hope our next trip will be as good as the one we had with Ashley."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Got to try the Dude's chicken salad!  It's not on the menu anymore but they will still make it - awesome!!"}
{"text":"I love mellow mushroom! Great decor cute little place."}
{"text":"awful.  and this coming from someone who gives every place pretty much a four or five star review.  pizza was ok.  employees were nice enough.  but the parents who go here use it as free day care.  kids were running around everywhere, beating up on each other.  my kids, who are no angels, but know how to behave, were horrified.  parents came up to us afterwards and said \"sorry\" - uhhhhh, too late, you think?  the owners need to screen parents and their kids before allowing them to come here.  this was not a mellow experience.  i still have nightmares."}
{"text":"Great place, great food, great service. Anthony is the best! Always takes care of our large party."}
{"text":"I've had really inconsistent experiences with this location. Sometimes there are families and sometimes there are mostly people drinking. Sometimes the staff is alright and other times they're bored / rude. It's just.. Inconsistent. That's really the best description I've got. But it's probably going to slow my roll from coming back to this specific location in the future until they get serious about the now hiring sign and just sweep whatever problem it is they're having with staff"}
{"text":"When my group sat down to eat (great location on Mill, BTW!), we elected to share a pizza and appetizers, but one of our friends was vegan.

They were able to cater to his needs easily. I don't normally eat vegan -- but the vegetable pizza and bruschetta were absolutely delicious!

The dough in the pizza is so incredible. It translates to all of their selections -- pretzels, et al.

Finally, the beer list is unending! They even have Papago BrewCo Orange Blossom, which you can combine with other brews!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place, always said they had the best pizza. Well I had dinner with my best friend, we usually do meat ball trio/ pizza and share it all. Well it was great we always love it, but the both of us woke up the next morning sick to our stomachs. Worst case of food poisoning either of us have ever had. Used to love this place but just get the chills thinking about it now. You guys should be more careful when preparing food because you lost 2 regulars!!"}
{"text":"I'm a ''Mellow'' from way back (1975) and have loved Mellow Mushroom throughout the years.  Mellow Mushroom is more than just good pizza, it's also atmosphere.  That atmosphere I would term as '70s, collegiate, ''laid-back''; that's a major area where the Ballantyne location fails for me as dining out is more than just eating food.
  I was so excited to see that a Mellow Mushroom had come to Ballantyne as it's much closer to my home (and no, I'm not a yuppy).  I waited until March in hopes that all the new restaurant ''kinks'' would have been worked out, I even visited during a slow time.
  My initial reaction walking in was that this was the first Mellow Mushroom that I'd ever been in that was trying NOT to be a Mellow Mushroom.  It had all the Mellow Mushroom trappings but instead of being fun, and cozy it was more urban and edgy(I will admit however, that I didn't get upstairs to see those cool tables!)  There were none of the cool college kids that most MMs have, nor the easy going cordiality that I've come to expect from MM...nothing but business here,,,get'em in, feed'em and get'em out.
  Our waiter was okay and our pizza was okay, but just...okay.  Not wonderful like I'm used to MM pizza being.  Two specifics were that the pizza was lukewarm and the bacon didn't seem cooked through.  Usually I love having extra pizza left over to take home and have sometimes been tempted to order an extra one to  enjoy the next day.  Not this time, the flavors just didn't have ''heart''.
  So, I guess I'll keep treking to Selwyn until the Rock Hill/ Fort Mill/ Steele Creek area gets a MM...someday."}
{"text":"Slow service, and even slower waiter.. Found a hair in my salad, shared that with my server and no  apology but he did  ask if I wanted another one.. Really? Ok not coming back here again...
Oh he did comp the salad.."}
{"text":"Our first time here and close to a 4, but the pizza just took too long to come out.

Our server was excellent.  When hearing I like different kind of beers he offered three samples.  He also led us towards the unique and tasty yukon gold pizza. Great thing about the place is you can split the specialty pies.  We split with the kosmic karma.  Totally different from the potato, but really good.  Crust is flavorful and we enjoyed it.

Half order of hot wings were just ok.  Not really hot, one off the wings should have been tossed from the batch and the ones that turned out were just alright.

Good beer, good pizza, good service - just have to be a little faster getting them out, especially since it was not busy at all.

I'd go back, but maybe not if I had to keep a schedule."}
{"text":"The Mighty Meaty is packed, but I love the Philosophers Pie with steak, olives & fetta cheese! Good service and clean."}
{"text":"Went to dinner last night with my wife prior to seeing a movie at the Harkins nearby. 

The restaurant wasn't too busy and it took a minute for host to arrive and seat us. Our server came over promptly and was attentive throughout the meal. Drinks were refilled timely and she was patient with us when we couldn't make up our mind on what to order. 

To start we shared an order of hot oven roasted wings. Best part of the meal. Good flavor, tender and nice to enjoy something that hasn't been deep fried. 

Moving onto the pizza....... Big swing and miss. I can see the appeal of happy hour, but the prices for their pizzas are quite high. 

We ordered a 10 inch Kosmic Karma. Red sauce, mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes, spinach, feta, and Roma tomatoes. This would have been a little better as a white pizza, but to accompany a heavy coating of pesto on top, they put nasty red sauce. This red sauce is lacking flavor and the little that it does have leaves a bad aftertaste. The crust looked like it would be tasty but it too was quite bland. For a place serving specialty pizzas I was expecting it to be bursting with great flavor. A pizza from Hungry Howie's would have been better even though they are by no means the best kind of pizza. Go to Grimaldi's for that. 

As far as portion sizes a 10-inch pie was more than enough for my wife and I to share. 

Overall I had high expectations after reviews on yelp and recommendations from coworkers. I will not be going back for another shot at dinner but may take a shot at happy hour one of these days."}
{"text":"Its good food. great happy hour. There is 2 good servers during happy hour. but everyone   else are retards people here are not so smart and don't know how to do transactions. we did a pick up order asked for double cut on our pizza. they wanted us to wait another 10 mins to double cut the pizza should of yelled at them therefore our food was cold, dominos would have been bettter. but they probably would of freaked out and quit felt bad for the cashier. she should do us all of us a favor and quit. but over all food is good people that work there are so so so so dumb. but 2 waitresses that work happy hour ."}
{"text":"Nice patio. Greeted by friendly staff. I didn't get the movie decor with the name. The service was soooo slow. We waited forever for everything. Prices are too high for alcohol and food. The food was mediocre. Not bad but not something you say mmmmm when you take a bite especially for the money. I would come back during happy hour but that's about it"}
{"text":"It's Mellow Mushroom, so the one thing that's sure to be good is the pizza.

NOW ON TO THE BAD: This is kind of a hit-or-miss \"bad\" thing, and I actually wrote about it in a prior review of the Tempe location. The problem is the pushy beer upselling. I understand they have to make money on these beers and it seems their primary motivation, but some of the waitresses are just ruthless with this junk. Upsell if you must, but have some freakin' discretion. Luckily, this has happened just once to us in going to the High St. location, but once was enough.

Said waitress was not only obnoxious with trying to sell beers, she even sat down at our table and ogled us, complete with alarmingly fake Scottsdale smile, as we tried to decide what to order. Creepiness just in time for Halloween, I guess. As other reviewers have noted, the wait staff seems to like to disappear for long periods and fraternize with coworkers as opposed to doing simple tasks like bringing the freakin' check back.

Like I said, it's hit or miss. Generally, and especially at High St., we've had a good wait staff experience; just seems the wait staff and the upselling are low points to the 'shroom.

As for other stuff, the decor and set-up here are pretty nice; plus, it doesn't seem to get overly packed here (last time we went was on a Friday night at Reverse Happy Hour; it was busy, but not loud and filled with bodies or anything). 

I reckon you should just cross your fingers that you don't get a potential car salesman for your waitress."}
{"text":"As promised, here's my \"make-up visit\" update.

Things improved dramatically since the last time I went. Firstly, our server wasn't an upsell machine. In fact, she was very polite and concerned about our order (Mine was particularly attentive with replacing and putting on the side of some ingredients, and she and the staff double-checked with me before and afterward to make sure everything was hunky-dory). The food was great, as always; had my first MM calzone, and I actually liked it better than the delicious pizza they have. 

No mention of this in my first reviews, as I don't recall going to the bathroom, but their bathroom is great! Ha, maybe TMI for a food review; however, really impressed with the privacy of the stalls.

Back to more relevant things, I was confused (though I suppose not off-put) about the happy hour rules (we went after 10, which is advertised as HH); apparently it isn't half-price appetizers on some nights and instead is a slice of pepperoni or something for $3? Not sure I call that a deal, but I guess beers being half-off makes up for it.

I was kind of disappointed they didn't have Fall Woodchuck as I went during their fall-themed beers time, but I guess it's kinda a pussy beer anyway (I'll qualify myself by saying I'm more of a straight liquor guy, but Woodchuck is my guilty pleasure). The waitress had a nifty hand-written updated list she kept with her, and while I'm not a beer man I can appreciate the effort in something like that.

Anyway, like I said, they seem to have really improved here and I definitely recommend them; for the food if not the service. BON APPETIT!"}
{"text":"Not for us. The pizzas were OK and that's about it. Prices seemed extremely high ($45 for 2 small pizzas, garlic bread, and sodas). Noise level way too high even with small crowd. The wall and overhead have no sound deadening and I could not hold a normal level conversation with my table mate. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed with this \"Stapley\" Mellow Mushroom. My first experience was to attempt a phone in order. It was a painful experience. I had a budget \"groupon\" and didn't want to go over the amount. I explained this to the person taking the order. When I was finished ordering I asked for the total and was given an amount above my groupon. I asked to take off an appetizer and was told that it already was being prepared and that a manager would have to take over. I have placed many phone orders and never has an order been sent to the kitchen until it's verified and paid for. Strange!  Then after a long period on hold waiting for a manager (at 10 minutes or more). I was disconnected. I won't be trying a phone in order again. It was very annoying.  I know there is a learning curve for a new restaurant but first impressions last a long time. I will not recommend this location. Eating out is supposed to be relaxing and enjoyable  

I love eating at the Tempe restaurant!  Sorry Stapley you just lost a customer."}
{"text":"Good outdoor ambience at a great location; thats the only great thing about this place.

When we went there, they served the food without giving plates or napkins; waited 10-15 minutes for someone to show up, who finally got the plates and by that time, food was cold. Quality of appetizers was good but the pizza had a week's worth of salt in them. Table size is also extremely small for the number of people they fit on them, there was no room even for the plates.!

Another caveat; if you are planning to sit outside in late evening, be prepared to deal with irritating small bugs hovering over the food!

Would likely not return."}
{"text":"I'm vegan, and I've been to this mellow mushroom multiple times. Always mostly impressed. The pizza is overpriced sometimes slow, but I've known to expect this. Tonight was different. We came in with a group of 8, all mostly vegan, which shouldn't be a problem because the restaurant advertises as being vegan friendly.

Well, as we went to order, the server informs us that the red sauce has meat in it. Immediately myself and all my friends were floored...we've all eaten the red sauce before. The \"chef\" (not sure who this was) came over to explain that the red sauce didn't have meat in it...whew.

First mistake - they screwed up my friends order. They orders a large pizza with just artichokes and vegan cheese. It came out as the mega veggie. When asked the server he was adamant that this would be taken care of on the bill (there's about an 8$ difference here). 

Secondly, I found bacon on my VEGAN pizza. The manager/chef came over and was apologetic. However, he offered to take off half the pizza, because we ate the other half. Really, if I knew it had bacon on it, I wouldn't eat ANY of it. I had to fight to get the entire pizza taken off...

Third, we sat down at 8:45 and didn't leave until after 10pm. This was mainly because the pizza took over an hour. That's unacceptable. 

Finally, when my friends questioned about the bill - yes, they were charged the extra $8 for the mega veggie, even though they didn't order it, they were given gift cards. Not cool. 

Finally, I want to stress that the mellow mushroom in tempe is NOT VEGAN FRIENDLY. The waitstaff and mangers don't understand vegans (they kept saying we could order anything off the gluten-free menu - no thanks the crust has egg). Also, they don't know what's vegan on the menu. You can't advertise as being vegan friendly if you don't know what's vegan - or even know what a vegan is. 

Beyond the vegan thing, the service was okay but clearly taking on hour for pizza when it's slow is not cool. And the ways that they tried to take care of their mistakes really were not appropriate. I will not be going back to mellow mushroom Tempe, and I want to caution vegans on going back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and food was surprisingly good, I liked the good beer selection
The servers were slow and needed to be reminded of drinks a few times but were helpful and nice
 It was worth it especially during happy hour
I'll be back to try again!"}
{"text":"I've been there twice and it's probably a tie between Mellow Mushroom and Humble Pie for the best pizza in the valley (yes, even better than Pizzeria Bianco).  Nice, but laid back atmosphere.  Great service and awesome selection of beers.  It doesn't get much better!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is phenomenal.  I am all about the Funky Q Chicken and the Buffalo Chicken pizzas.

It's strange to be here because in VA, Mellow Mushroom is part of the college scene.  This one is a more cut-and-dry, well-maintained, family-friendly version.

It is really loud in the evenings (as they blast music at the bar), so try to be far away or if it's not too hot try to get outside, otherwise you're shouting to be heard."}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  First time there and Will come back often.. I had the pretzel bites. Ceaser salad pizza.. Very yummy"}
{"text":"Man, some of these reviews are harsh. I split a pizza with spinach artichoke dip as the sauce and it was so freaking good.  My kids had a separate pizza, regular, my son for the first time ate the crust. My mom, allergic to wheat, milk, eggs and almost everything else, got a gluten free vegan pizza she said it was the best she's ever had. Even I liked her pizza a lot and vegan cheese usually scares me. Our server, a guy, was great. The service was a little slow, but it wasn't that bad and we didn't care the pizza was fresh.  Chill out folks, this place was really good."}
{"text":"Pizza there is great, across the board. Even their gluten free option.
I've heard people complain about the price. If you compare it to chains, yes. But it's worth it. Fresh, natural/organic ingredients.

Every time I've gone the service has been great. Love the selection of appetizers. The easy, and really good, choices for those are the pretzels made from the same stuff as their crust, and the mozzarella meatballs."}
{"text":"We like the Mellow Mushroom. Never had bad service there and the pizza is great. Good atmosphere and location."}
{"text":"The 3 meat pizza was excellent, the honey dipped pretzels would probably be better if I wasn't completely stuffed! And if you get and Arnold Palmer with the green tea its actually really good. And I'm not a green tea fan at all.

Oh yea, free WIFI too!!!"}
{"text":"I went here when it first opened. I man in a giant mushroom costume gave me a free pen and lured me in! I had been to the Myers Park MM location for pizza, but it had been a while. I stopped in the Uptown location went during lunch midweek and also straight after work so it was about half full- the average office crowd. I had the chicken wings and pretzels appetizers which were excellent. I tried the gluten free pizza, but it was a disappointment. It wasn't so much as a crust problem, I didn't even really like the cheese either. 

When you go to a pizza restaurant and like everything but the pizza, you'd think that would be a problem. Well, if you want a pizza it can be. The bar around the back is lively so stop in for a few drinks, order an appetizer, and then head on home.

UPDATE: Went back August 2014. I was served this ridiculously burnt pretzel appetizer. Clearly no quality control in the kitchen. I uploaded the photo as proof so check it out! So disappointed now, will never be returning."}
{"text":"Been here a few times with the work gang.  Previously, I hadn't been too impressed with their Za.  First time I ordered my standard pie: pepperoni and green peppers.  The crust was pretty good, thin-ish, crispy on the edges.  The sauce and ingredients were decent, but not stellar.

My buddies always get the \"Red Skin Potato Pie\" speciality, and that is indeed pretty tasty, but I can only eat 1 slice of something like that before I'm bored with it.

While their \"regular\" pizza are just ok, I suspected the specialty pizzas are the way to go.  So, today I tried the \"Melchacho\" which was chipotle sauce base with chorizo, red peppers, avocado and cilantro.  WOW!  Great flavors, perfectly spicy. I will absolutely come back for that pie.  It's not listed on the corporate menu online, but it's available at the Mill Ave (Tempe) location.  Did I say \"WOW!\"  Yeah, I think I did.

SERVICE: The wait staff is always great, but every time I've been it takes quite a long time for the pizzas to come out.    Not recommended if you're on a tight lunch schedule."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix for a long weekend, we ate here two days in a row. The first day started out very well with a lunch of the Kosmic Karma pizza - with the addition of sausage. Very good late night leftovers that night, as well! The next day, before our flight left, we stopped here for a quick lunch/dinner since we thought the food the day before was decent. My friend got the steak and cheese hoagie - while she proceeded to eat it - she found a hair! We pointed this out to the bartender (as we sat at the bar) and she just threw it away and brought us our bill. She never informed the cook or manager. She also did not take off the price of my friend's meal. In a restaurant setting - this is inappropriate! Will not return on my next visit to Phoenix..."}
{"text":"I recently used a Groupon at the Mesa location of one of my fav pizza places.  I love the MM on Mill Ave.  
What I ordered for take out was a gluten free Holy Shitake with Sausage
When I arrived for the pick up, I was ushered in to a tiny vestibule that felt like a closet.  When I finally got my pizza I opened it to make sure it was my order ( one never knows the sadness until you arrive home with the wrong food). 
What I found, was a over sauced, undercooked and minimal mushroom cold pizza.  Yuck!!!!!   I asked for a remake, with comments on the reason.  There was sooooo much oil under the pizza it was revolting. 
They gladly remade it and were proud to show off the vast improvement.  Only when I arrived home did I discover that they plopped that remade pie into the original box and basically soaked the crust in that old oil.  Thanks a lot for the consideration and thoughtfulness in creating my dinner.  
I won't return.....if you want a great Gluten free pizza experience in Mesa, head over to Vitos on Lindsay.  Those folks know how to make a pie and great pasta as well.  
Mellow Mushroom in Mesa...you failed, twice!!!!"}
{"text":"i will never eat at mellow mushroom on happy valley and i-17 again....there was a bug in my boy's food, ants on the bar and another bug on the ground. they acted like it was no big deal and still gave us a bill for the almost everything..."}
{"text":"Second time at this place and I got more of a feel for the vibe and the food. The food was a little better the first time, second visit we ended up with burnt pizza crust. Staff was awesome. Dude named Tyler was our server and he was awesome. Will go back again."}
{"text":"I went to Mellow Mushroom last night after receiving a Groupon for them. I've lived very near them for the last few years, but was never inclined to attend prior.

I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere was decent, there was plenty of parking space, and the service was attentive. The prices were average and reasonable - similar to a Chilis or California Pizza Kitchen. I understand they have a Happy Hour, which would put all their appetizers half off, making their bruschetta and wings around $3.

As far as the food taste and quality, I was really impressed. I'm not much of a pretzel fan, but theirs were probably the best I've ever had - I'm actually considering them again for lunch today. I'm also not the biggest fan of hot wings, but theirs were - again - delicious; they were super crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I also had the White Pizza, which utilized the same gooey delicious dough that was used for their pretzels. I've had many white pizzas in the past, and they're often dry due to the lack of red sauce - not Mellow Mushroom's White Pizza. It was loaded with cheese and sun dried tomatoes, and enticed me enough to eat well beyond the capacity of my stomach. 

I left Mellow Mushroom overstuffed and happy. I will absolutely be going back very, very soon."}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets ! I have had pizza all over Charlotte and this one tops them all....If you are a purest, ask for the original veggie...add pepperoni if you like...It's outstanding....It's not on the menu but they'll know what you want ! Great atmosphere -"}
{"text":"So far I've been there twice. There selection of beer is decent and half off for happy hour which make a 20oz glass around $3. The pizza was delicious, however I think it could have been more thick with the toppings. We customized their White Pizza by adding Pesto Chicken to it and it was really good. We also tried a couple of their appetizers. The Stuffed Portabello Mushroom was good, but I do not recommend it with any of their beers as it comes with a very pungent vinaigrette sauce. It would work well with a glass of white wine. The artichoke dip was fantastic and served with ample amounts of what they call garlic bread (which was actually pita bread cut  up into triangles). Appetizers are also half off during happy hour. The place always seems packed so get in early especially if there's a football game on."}
{"text":"I have eaten several pizza places in the valley.  I like this location compared to the Happy Valley.  (That one seemed like the sauce was too salty). The wheat like bread opposed to white tastes yummy, and my husband much enjoyed the gluten free crust, as he has compared to many too. The only downside was the cost  $60 for two pizzas to get it the way you want because none of the specialties seemed like good enough standards the way they are.  After Market Bistro closing, hard to find a good pizza joint on this end of town.  This pizza reminds me of Barros but just a little bit healthier version and I like really Barros. Other places have too much grease on the pizza for my liking."}
{"text":"Good food, willing to accommodate a large group, a little loud but worth it"}
{"text":"I have two reviews in one, but I will start with tonight's. All I have to say is, it seems, from other reviews, that this place needs a new delivery guy.

I call to ask to get a pizza delivered - I chose mellow mushroom because they have vegan pizza (I am severely lactose intolerant) because last time I had their vegan pizza in-house, I liked it a LOT and had a craving. Due to some issues that don't need to be gotten into, I cannot go there myself and get it, so I asked for delivery. 

When I told the girl where I lived (on Guadalupe), she said she thought they stopped delivery at Baseline but would go ask. The girl (who was very nice) comes back on the phone and says the delivery guy is \"in a bad mood tonight\" and said no and when she explained that I am (apparently) only 2 miles out of their zone, he said \"I don't answer to you.\" I asked to speak to the manager and she said \"he was standing right there when I asked.\" 


REALLY? What the heck kind of place is this? What kind of boss stands around and lets employees talk to each other like that (from what I hear, the delivery jerk is related to the boss, so maybe that's it?)

My second review, from 2 times of actually being at this restaurant, is the same. The food, except for the vegan pizza (which is SO GOOD, but kind of on the expensive side...) isn't very good. I ordered the cinnamon honey pretzels and they were so dry they weren't edible. The garlic/cheese bread is also incredibly dry. 

If they would have been willing to work with me on the delivery, I *might* have given them 3 stars, but for the bad attitude this place seems to constantly have, they only get 2. Which is really a bummer, because their vegan pizza is so good.

EDIT!!: Alright, so a few hours after I wrote this review, the general manager, Jason, called me about my review to apologize and talk with me about what happened. He apologized multiple times for the awkward situation that went down, and while he was not present when it happened, he obviously took my review seriously. He then offered to deliver a free pizza to me himself, and that if I didn't want it this evening, he would bring it any other time. I took him up on his offer and he brought me a pizza. 

Being in a manager position myself, I understand sometimes what managers have to go through, and his choice to call me and try to make it right is commendable and I really appreciated it. Sometimes businesses or employees mess up, but what matters is what they do to FIX it. Jason went the extra mile. 

Thanks to this, I changed my review to 3 stars. Also, this vegan pizza is amazing as always."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom has become a staple to the High St community over the years that High St has opened. Walking into the place is pleasing to the eyes as it is full of different vibrant colors and diverse d√©cor. As being a long-time customer that can be oblivious to the d√©cor, I find myself usually noticing something different that I didn't see before. The lights and chandeliers are a mixture of different color mood lighting mixed with the jazz and musical appeal of drums, trumpets, and saxophones. You usually can notice the different musical notes along the walls and the ceilings. It offers the flexibility of a eastern facing patio that is quite large and offers an outside spot to the bar inside. Inside you have the large bar that is the main attraction (to myself) but offers multiple large booths and separate rooms for those to escape into the restaurant atmosphere. 
I should go into others details than price but being a stickler to certain aspects of why I enjoy this place is because of the certain prices that are offered during happy hour and reverse happy hour. Most places have as many craft beer selections as Mellows does know that they can charge a higher price and get away with it; even during happy hour. Mellow provides the best prices for craft beers, drinks, and appetizers during regular happy and reverse. Having to only pay for under $4.00 for a 20oz craft beer on draft is phenomenal. They offer half price beer, drinks, and apps during the happy hours. NOO!!!, other place in the area or the valley can compare to the happy hour prices as I can assure you, Northeast Phoenix and Scottsdale always have higher prices than those surrounding the valley. Although, regular priced hours can be a little more expensive if you are thinking it of just an another Pizza place. But as stated earlier in the general area as being an upper class division it does well being competitive and fair.
The main food that Mellow is notorious for is the pizza. I do understand that they also offer burgers (which are newer), hoagies, salads, and a full munchies appetizer list. The wings are usually good as I consider myself a wing connoisseur. However, this is one of those factors that I will critique as you should ask for them to be extra crispy and extra sauce. They are decent quality but can be too soft, mushy, and the word gooey comes to mind. That is why I suggest asking for them extra crispy but also extra sauce as half the time I have received them with almost zero sauce on them... (sparing the sauce for a cost?). 
All in all, I do recommend the place to family, friends, business associates, dates, and those going out for a comfortable nightlife. I know I may be \"buyest\" to the place because of the happy hour, amazing rotational of craft beers, and half price options. The wait staff has changed a bit over the years but the one bartender that has always made it a positive place is, \"Joe\". I believe that he is the best bartender that they have and should treat him as an asset for the company. One last thing is that sometimes after going to Mellow for the last few years and sometimes more often than one or most should they could offer a long-term loyal customer some type of royalty program or comp a drink or food every now and then.

What???  I don't even care about the dollar.  It's the principle of the matter.  Just tell me the scotch is $11 not $10."}
{"text":"Great attentive staff. Very welcoming and great with the kids. Pizza was fresh and hot and sandwich was tasty. Only knock would be the sandwich price was a little pricey but it was good and the staff made up for any higher cost!"}
{"text":"To start I'm going with three starts because I am a HUGE fan of their pizzas. My bf and I were vacationing in Florida and ate at a mellow mushroom there and we absolutely LOVED everything about it. That being said, I was then visiting family in Arizona and looked up to see if there were any around, I told my family and they agreed to go with me. I was happy to show them something they hadn't tried close to them and something I had enjoyed so much, that being said we stopped at the restaurant after a full day at the waterpark nearby and it was mostly empty. 

We got say in a both near the bar area and our waitress was also the bartender. Right away she seemed to have an attitude like she didn't want to deal with our group of 6 & didn't come by to take our order, we had to flag her down. She took our order of two large pizzas in a rush and ran off.When our pizzas came one was messed up and instead of being apologetic, she asked if we would like to try it, one of the kids in our group did not want the spicy sauce on the pizza and therefore did not want it. Even after she tried it. We again had to flag the waitress down because she was too busy, and when we told her that we would need a new pizza she offered to make a small just for the child. Instead of making a whole new pizza for us, if that was the case then she should have taken the large pizza off our bill instead, and just charged us for the small one they made to replace it, since the large was mostly not eaten &  it was not what we asked for.

We had to split our bill into two separate ones because we wanted to use a groupon and another coupon we had received in an email, which was fine since most offers are not combinable (not that the fine print on either coupon had said that) we did the smaller bill with cash, it was 6.91$ we gave 10$, and the larger one I put on my card. I had intended to leave her tip on my card and let my cousin have her cash change, but the waitress just pocketed the 2.09$ and did not give us our change back on the cash bill. Which absolutely infuriated me because I had never told her to keep the change. She just grabbed the little black book without a word and gave it back with only my card inside and the slip to sign. Needless to say after that experience I did not leave her an additional tip. I would have liked to speak to a manager but was never offered the chance and never saw one walking around."}
{"text":"Logan and Jenna are amazing. I always get great service and I couldn't be happier with my experienced! I love mellow mushroom"}
{"text":"One of the best places for Happy Hour/ brewery, selection of beers and food. Meatballs and/or 10 Wings for under $10.00 is a great price and good.  Just wish the Happy Hour was on Saturday or we would arrive more frequently.  Service is always great and friendly."}
{"text":"Have only been here a few times, but after last night I just cant again. Service was fine, food was fine. But....their prices are outrageous. I'm someone who gladly pays whatever the price for a great meal, I am not a tight wad by any means. And I always tip at least 20%. Always. But I went in and ordered a small pizza with 3 toppings (small, personal Size, the size of a dinner plate) and 2 drinks and spent $50!!! The pizza came to about 20 bucks for that tiny pizza. I was really annoyed. Felt kind of ripped off. I didn't say anything to the server cause it's not her fault and the prices are what they are. I just feel I could have spent that at La Bocca across the street and got a nice dinner... I just think that's way too steep for 4 small slices of pizza."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is the place to go whenever you want a cheap, Family night out. Whether you want a Pizza, Calzone, or Sandwich Mellow's employees will deliver."}

{"text":"Bland, uninteresting and uninspiring calzones, and at $12-13 apiece, a poor value. I won't patronize this place again - subsidizing mediocrity merely perpetuates it."}
{"text":"We've been here three or four times, but both my husband and I think the food just keeps getting worse with each visit. On the most recent visit the pizza we ordered was burned on the bottom and greasy on the top. The atmosphere is nice, and they have a good beer menu but I doubt we will be back anytime soon until we hear that the food has improved.
The Mellow Mushroom in uptown is much better, so maybe it is just this location."}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Always a delight.

They \"burnt\" my pizza... It was more crispy than they preferred so they brought it to me, told me I could pick on it and that they had another coming right out. They gave me the pizza for free! I mean, I would have eaten it crispy, but I was impressed that they admitted it wasn't up to their standards and righted the wrong. Great customer service! I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"This place is a happy hour gem. First off, their staff is amazing. Marlena is very knowledge and always has good recommendations when it comes to their large selection of alcoholic beverages. Happy hour gets you half off drinks and appetizers. I'm there every Tuesday night! See you there!"}
{"text":"Gave it my last shot. So today when I decided reluctantly to take both my boys and neice to your location to celebrate my sons birthday I was very rudely told that we don't offer ANYTHING for birthdays and boy was that hostess right not even a verbal happy birthday to my son. Way to go Mello mushroom, not only did you disappoint an 8 year old boy you have lost our entire families business and anyone else's who I can share your \"family friendly\" policies with. Won't disappoint us again because we will never go back. Congratulations."}
{"text":"Took my wife and daughter here for a quick lunch on a weekday. The service was excellent and the pizza is delicious.  The ingredients that MM uses are super fresh and really stand out over other pizza options in the same area.  The craft beer selection is also one of the best if not the best for a pizza place in Mesa.   Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately sat on the patio for 45 min,when I informed the GM how long it took for service I was dismissed as a cheap college student.with no discount received for our consistent patronage I shall go to Pranksters on Broadway instead,"}
{"text":"This place is growing on me again. Randy the main bartender is very efficient and the kitchen has gotten more consistent. Very reliable pies and a decent place to watch the game."}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch there June 1, 2017 and the food was OUTSTANDING.  We both had 1/2 a sandwich me a meatball, my husband avocado and veggies. Our server was Danille the manager. She was working as a server because they were so busy. Whenever the boss is working to help out her employees I am impressed. We will definitely be back with friends."}
{"text":"Server failed to tell us it was happy hour. Food is pretty good. The place was very loud."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Mellow Mushroom was back in August. We knew nothing about the place but decided to give it a try anyway. I don't need to go through all the details of what Mellow Mushroom is all about, but if you've never heard of them, they're known for their Dough, mainly pizza. They have a full bar and a large selection of beer. 
The first time we visited, I gotta tell you, I wasn't impressed with service or cleanliness. We were seated right by the large windows near the bar; there were about 30-40 flies all over the glass near our booth and that entire section of the restaurant. We were so disgusted that we had to ask to be moved. The waiter apologized and moved us a few tables away. 
We ordered our pizza and drinks; the pizza was good, but there were still flies all over the place. While we ate, we asked the waiter to bring us a to go box just so we could put our pizza in it, protecting it from all the flies.
The only reason we went back to this restaurant was because the pizza was good. Also, I don't believe their food is priced fairly. $27 for a large pizza is too much; it's not like they put expensive toppings on it or anything. 
Since then, we've gone back a few times. One thing has become clear to us and that is that the food here is inconsistent. Our experience has been hit and miss; there are times they make the pizza good, and there are times that the pizza is just ok."}
{"text":"Ridiculously high prices; I mean absolutely bonkers. Beers are over $6.00 and most pizzas are over $20.00... The pizza was good, the wings were not. I am from New York, however, and this pizza is nothing special and worth nowhere near that much. The bartender recommended a beer that was served to me in a rocks glass. When I inquired about that, she told me they only serve 9 oz glasses since it is an ale with a higher alcohol content. When my change for a 20 dollar bill was $12.30 I was shocked. I will not be coming back here; If I want a good beer selection there are a dozen other places in the area, and the same goes for pizza."}
{"text":"We sat behind a couple who the manager wrongly accused of not paying their bill.
The manager Terrah, was screaming at them and told them they were lying about giving the payment to their server, used profanity towards them and threatened to call the police. All In front of the other patrons. 
The female customer said their server was obviously high on drugs and suggested she lost it.
The manager refused to listen to them. 
When the manager found that the server HAD misplaced their payment, she said to them \"good bye. You can go\" 
No apologies, no sorry our mistake. Nothing. 
I have NEVER witnessed such unprofessional behavior. 
As a business owner myself, knowing that management represents us in our absence, I would be embarrassed and appalled by her treatment of these people. 
Perhaps both employees need drug testing.
Needless to say the manager should be fired.
I highly doubt that couple will be returning to Mellow Mushroom and neither will we.
Our server was perfect and the food was good but we can do without the managers \"Jerry Springer\" side show.
I'm sure the owner will understand, if not the manager, how powerful word of mouth is in this business."}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner usually go to the Ballantyne location.  We waited at least 15 minutes before going up to the hostess and requesting a server.  Then we had to stop her to get a manager because we still didn't have a server.  The manager took our order, the server came over twice, the second time to give us our bill.  It was a Friday night and not even busy.  The water tasted like dish soap and our pizza was sub par.  We will never return to this location.  Really disappointing for a Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"First of all if there were 0 \"ZERO\" stars I would rate that! The food is way over priced for what it is, there are a ton of other restaurants in the area that all have to keep the quality of food good & prices fair (competitive). Nowadays with the economy- shouldn't we expect more for our hard earned buck! Well my first & only experience was St. Pattys day, I sat at the bar, had ordered a sandwich to go, since the takeout entrance did not have a noticeable sign out front. 

  The 45 minute wait and $11 hoagie!!! which by the way was supposed to be HOT, was tepid, yes technically cold! I didn't feel like giving a tip for a takeout, especially at that price, but the bartender gave me a nasty sneer when she saw the signed ticket, which service can make or break any restaurant, but this was just nasty! I wrote a letter to the management and in hopes they would get their act together, but from the mixed reviews, and by method of deduction, still having problems.  

  Seems to me just another new establishment who is way over priced for the value! Places like this take advantage of the public and it's shameful. But far be it from me to begrudge someone from earning a living, I'm all in favor of making a buck just like any other normal person, just make prices more reasonable and food quality better, growing pains I guess...(just keeping it optimistic) Make it right= recipe for success, or Continue same path=recipe for matter of time before out of business.  No I will not be visiting this place again, NOR would I recommend this to anyone I would not want to get food poisoning! 

I hope this review was helpful fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"Recent visit with my oldest daughter.  Great pizza!!!!!!!!!!  Crust has that perfect crunch.
Tap beer selection is awesome."}
{"text":"Had dinner here after Oktoberfest shenanigans and this place really hit the spot. The service was good and the pizza was fantastic. I love the potato one (don't remember the name) and the crust on the simple pepperoni was stellar. The thai pizza was good, but had a tad too much of the sweet sauce. It's the only one that wasn't wiped clean, which usually happens with that one. 

I can't wait for some more of that potato pie... plus they've got the Four Peaks Pumpkin Stout on draft. Holla!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to eat. They have have great pizza for vegans and non-vegans alike. It's actually rather impressive the large amount of options vegan folk have when ordering a pizza there.

They also have a great beer selection, in fact I am a member for their \"beer club\", where you can get prizes for drinking beer. The price for their beer is also very reasonable. 

I'm 90% sure all of their crusts are gluten free as well, which is a plus but doesn't matter to me as much as just having yummy vegan goodness.

The only reason I'm not giving the MM 5 stars is it's quality fluctuates a lot. Some days I'll go in and it's great service and food quality, other days I go in and It's ok (never a bad experience yet).

I do recommend the garlic bread, just let them know to make it vegan if that be your preference."}
{"text":"We had a good experience.  Tossed salad was great and the Maui Mowie pizza was great.  Spicy Jamaican jerk.  Sat up in the mezzanine d the kids loved the cool table."}
{"text":"wow! I can't believe some of the peoples reviews about MM. all you people who are complaing about it bring over priced need to really look at a menu online before you go out to eat.  if your smart enough to use this site your smart enough to find an online menu. and if its to expensive go eat somewhere else thats in your budget and stop ranking on a place that serves good fresh quality food. maybe its just that your to use to eating sandwiches from subway and pizza from dominoes and sucking back some cold keystones. I know that it's a free country buy please at least know wtf your talking about. oh ya and you who bitch about the service on weekends your the problem. if you really want to enjoy a night out here's some advice. try going out on a weekday. it's amateur night on weekends. if you were a diner you'd know this. all you people who scurry out at 7 on a fri or sat night and expect the world need to get real and understand that your creating the problem. do us all a favor and shut up and order take out and eat it in your doublewide. and that all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.  Perfect every time.  Addicted to the magical mystery pizza.  Beer selection great as well.  Service kind and attentive.  My goto spot for great pizza.   Salads average."}
{"text":"Great food. We had the house special and it was really good. Kinda pricy ( $26 for a large, but I would say it is worth it. Staff was friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"First try of this pizza place since they opened last month. Got Friday lunch takeout consisting of a small redskin potato pie and an order of the cheese bread. Young woman was polite on the phone and in person when I picked it up after about a half hour, no waiting. Pizza and cheese bread were delicious. Great flavors, nicely presented.  Cost was a little north of $18, which is about the same for any other good local specialty pizza takeout, and was more than enough food to get at least two meals for an average size fellow like me. I will definitely try them again in the future for takeout, and would like to eat in as well, just for the trippy-hippie decor."}
{"text":"We had the house pizza, well done, minus the green peppers. It was awesome. The beer list was great but the best part of the dinner was the bartender. Danielle was so nice to us and was really fun to talk with. She made the experience truly memorable. We'll come back not just for the pizza but to hang with Daniel again too."}
{"text":"Came here on a game day because every where else was too busy. Mellow Mushroom was a calm place (at least when I went) and very friendly. 

I went ahead and got a cheese pizza. The wait time was about average of 20 minutes. While the food was good, I didn't see it as anything special. It was quite average. For last minute plans, this was a good stop. 

The pizza itself tasted a little too cheesy, but the crust was great!

Definitely a good place for a family night out. 

Will probably patronize again sometime."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a year and a half, came on opening night and was blown away by the beer selection and it has only gotten better.  They used to change the taps a little more often, but their selection never disappoints.  Service can be spotty, sitting at the bar is your best bet.  All the pies are great but beware of the price if you make your own."}
{"text":"Is it an acceptable policy that when you ask  for the manager, that he can tell the waitress he is too busy to see you? It is a Sunday at 2:30, which really is not that busy!

Lots of empty seats here!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has gotten worse and worse at each visit. Tonight, our family went here and they literally ran out of silverware and by the time the utensils came our food was cold. I talked to the manager and we received $5 off the bill as compensation. For cold food!? And the server was quite rude and not apologetic at all. The food is ok, and the service is really terrible. We will not be going back. For the price? No way."}
{"text":"Poor planning and a staff that does not know what they are selling. 
My wife, son and I went on a Tuesday night and I ordered a beer and my wife ordered a glass of red wine.  The waitress returned and said that they were out of both. No explanation, no apology, nothing. I then ordered a water and my wife a different wine. The wine came this time but was less than 1/2 a glass and we know what we should have received. No complaint from us this time. 

We proceeded to order one 12\" and one 14\" pizzas. When they came out, we received two 12\" pizzas so the waitress ordered another 12\" instead of the 14\" we ordered. Needless to say we were charged for three 12's........for their mistake. I had enough. 

If I return, it will have to be after I forget about this horrible experience."}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza and was a little turned off by the fact that the foursquare special doesn't apply to the root beer even though it's for \"Soft-drinks.\" We had ordered the Kosmic Karma and the pesto was good but I never really tasted the sundries tomatoes and what little sauce I could taste, tasted like it came out of a can. For being on Mill you'd think it would be better. The ambiance is probably the best thing about the place. Art is nice and it's well decorated but lets be real, if you want a good pizza, try one of the smaller local places like Ottos."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to try out Mellow Mushroom but unfortunately what we experienced was mediocre pizza, slow service and servers that were wearing a few sizes too small t-shirts that made our dinner even more unappetizing."}
{"text":"Pizza and salad is good, but the service is average. Good place to hang out in evening just before after the movie!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Mellow Mushroom for the first time last week because we had a Groupon for $10 off.  We were impressed with the service Evan, our waiter, gave us, as we had to be in and out in about 30 minutes and he made it happen despite the little league team that had come in just before us.

The food itself was, for the most part, great.  We shared a chopped salad with the house vinaigrette which was quite good, but I little expensive at $8.49.  Since we split it, though, the per person cost wasn't terrible.

What really surprised us though was the price for the pizza.  Normally we like to order the equivalent of a Margherita Pizza (fresh mozzarella, fresh basil and tomatoes), but were dismayed not to see this on the menu and thus had to build our own.  To our astonishment both fresh basil and mozzarella were \"double ingredients\", which would have caused our total to be $21.74 before tax for a 14\" medium traditional Margherita.  Wow.  We ended up opting just for the fresh basil, nixing the tomato and fresh mozzarella, to bring the pre-tax pizza total to $16.17--still expensive, but what the heck, we had a Groupon!

The most disappointing part was, when we got the pizza, the amount of fresh basil that was on it was barely close to covering, maybe an average of 6-8 small half-inch slivers per piece, even though we paid over $3 for it (which honestly would have bought us a full basil plant!).

Despite that, the overall taste was great.  We really enjoyed the buttery/flaky crust and the sauce was just the right amount of sweet with a touch of tangy to it.

Overall, we had a good experience.  The food, while a little overpriced, was quite enjoyable.  Mellow Mushroom really has the potential to be one of our local favorites, but until we see a little more value for the money we're paying for our ingredients, we may only be back the next time we see another Groupon deal pop up."}
{"text":"We visited Mellow Mushroom for the first time for dinner this Saturday night. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The place has a great atmosphere and the portions are huge. We ended up taking home almost half of the meal."}
{"text":"This is a frequent lunch spot for me.  Check out coupon sites, as they frequently have something running.  The service is always great and with a smile.  The gluten free options are clearly marked and yummy !! Lots of great drink options beer and wine. 
Be sure to check out the local specials , that's normally what I have.  But can't go wrong with the jerk chicken any time of year.  Be sure to leave extra time for some items like pizzas since they take a little longer to prepare.  This location is on the north side of the street  in the Norterra shopping center.  It's EAST of I 17 so be sure to turn at the light before the traffic circle or you will have to go ALL the way around again !!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a burger (probably my own fault). The burger was soggy and tasted as though it was microwaved. The bread was just regular buns you could find at a grocery store. Each bite was so oily and gross I stopped eating the burger halfway. The potato wedges were dry and really stale as though they were sitting outside for a while. Really disappointed but not surprised."}
{"text":"We were taking our daughter and granddaughter to lunch at OCB,but they were closed for good and thought we should try next door. Mellow Mushrooms is an awesome food and very nice pizza place recommending to everyone to give it a try,you'll like"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place with my family after purchasing a groupon for it. Wow!! First off the ambience is super cute. It has roomy booths for families and a bar for those date nights or to have a drink with friends. It also has a very large patio. I ordered a small Greek salad and the meatballs appetizer. The small salad was a nice portion. The meatballs were to die for. My husband got the might meaty pizza and my son cheese. Both great! The pizza dough was also amazing. The services was also great. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times but my experiences haven't been consistent. The first time I went was a good experience. The food was yummy (although nothing extraordinary), fast and friendly service by our male server (unfortunately don't remember his name otherwise I would give him a shoutout), and we were in and out within 45 minutes.

I recently went again around lunchtime and we were seated promptly by the hostess outside on the patio. It wasn't busy. About 10 minutes passed as people around us were greeted. The servers were very obviously ignoring our table for whatever reason. Finally one of them comes and says \"Have you guys been helped yet?\" Well, given that no one has acknowledged our existence yet... So without an apology she takes our order. Our drinks were brought quickly, but the food (one medium-sized pizza) took about 25 minutes. Our drinks were never refilled. Someone else brought out our pizza - it was another male server who was also very friendly and helpful and didn't hesitate to bring us what we needed. The original server didn't bother to speak to us again until she brought the bill. It took 15 minutes total for us to pay our bill. Which, I might add, was almost $25 for one medium pizza.

This would have been a much better review had it not been for the lousy service we received as well as the over-priced menu. Overall, wouldn't recommend to a friend. There are plenty of other great pizza places in the area to chose from."}
{"text":"This place is good. Ingredients are legit. The staff gives a youthful. fun vibe. We ordered out but I could imagine having a great time eating in.

It was a decent wait for our food but there is plenty of shops to check out nearby while you do so.

Food's good, a bit pricey but totally worth a try. I highly recommend to try at least once."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time. Truly enjoyed the food and atmosphere.  most of all the outstanding service we received. Heather was an awesome server. We look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"Did a Groupon deal to give Mellow Mushroom a try, went there 1st time ever and I have to say I was rather disappointed. 
Ordered 2 medium pizzas, (cant remeber which kind) the Groupon should have covered $20, however I still had to pay an additional $25.  This was takeout so nothing else was ordered.

So my overall total was around $45 for 2 medium pizzas that in the end tasted like pizza patron anyways.  Thanks but no thanks, this place is too expensive!"}
{"text":"First restaurant my family and I went to. A little pricey but overall was extremely satisfied with the great tasting pizza. Good service and great 1st impression of Tempe!"}
{"text":"Got delivery from one of the few pizza places with gluten-free and delivery options. Phone service was great-friendly and efficient however the pizza we received was less than up to par..a $10 pizza at best. The toppings were so scarce and were placed 2.5 inches within the crust line. A 14\" $27 pizza presented in a $10- 8\" pizza form. The manager was more than apologetic and recovered well but we will not be ordering from them again. I will say that the food tastds good but was so NOT worth $40 for a 14\" Lazy pizza and 10 wings (+tip) sorry mellow mush...not worth it to me."}
{"text":"Very creative and good pizza. Good for groups of people!! I've been there multiple times and each time has been well worth it."}
{"text":"This was just ok. I got the steakhouse salad, which came with four pieces of meat the size of quarters. I'm sorry, but that's no $13 salad. I had to send it back, because I asked for the meat to be cooked through and it was rare.

My dining partner said her pizza was tasteless.

It was very loud.

In all, it was too much money for what we got. We won't go back."}
{"text":"The last part of this review was from the first time I went and had a sandwich and soup (still a low three stars there). I am updating because I have gone since and had their pizza, which was amazing and certanly deserves five stars! I had the loaded baked potato pizza. It was one of the best pizzas I have ever had. The crust is so good! The toppings were high quality. Will surely go there for pizza again!

This place was ok. Got the tempeh hoagie and tomato bisque. The sandwich had way too many strong flavors; marinade, vinaigrette, pesto, feta cheese and sprouts. It was a bit much, but I was still able to eat it. The tomato bisque was another story. I am certain it was pizza sauce with broth whisked in. It was so thick I could eat it with a fork! The waitstaff was great. The ambiance was cool and different. I may go back to try the pizza and pretzels and if I do I will update my review. As of now it sits on the low side of three stars. Quality ingredients but poor execution in my opinion."}
{"text":"Weekend lunch with friends.
Takes a while to make the food.
Pricey.

*Avoid the calzone*
Worst calzone ever."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, The only downside was the volume of the music that caused us to have to yell and ask what did you say all the time."}
{"text":"Stopped in before a Knights game and you could tell the staff was clueless. They had several open tables and a line out the door.  They were advising waiting customers they couldn't seat them for at least 20 minutes because they didn't want to overwhelm the kitchen.  I'm sure it will get better when they get some experienced staff but would recommend avoiding for a while until they work the kinks out."}
{"text":"I will never order a pizza to go again. You are treated like a second class citizen and I've now been waiting 33 minutes for a personal size pizza. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Worst service ever
Denied PIZZA because I did not have a horizontal ID when I am 23 years old
Restaurant is only 21 and up after 12
You can't even order food
This is a joke right?"}
{"text":"I just threw my five-year-old's birthday here and it was the perfect spot! We were able to use a private dining area for 20 people and the staff could not be more accommodating!!"}
{"text":"I went to Mello Mushroom for first time  Saturday 8-16-2014    The Good  Pizza (House Special) tasted good enough, even though a little over priced.  The salad was good (Enlightened Spinach Salad) although I have never ordered a spinach salad that didn't come pre-dressed and they really didn't have a traditional Spinach Salad dressing, we did the balsamic.  It was a Saturday afternoon at about 4:15 and there were maybe 15 people in the  place and was definitely not busy, and there was plenty of staff  6 or so pizza makers , 4-5 servers (I assume they were servers anyway) and a couple hostess and at least 1 manager on duty that I could see not including bar kitchen and bar staff.

OK now the not so good....   I don't think our server worked there ( I say this half jokingly) se showed up at out table to take out order, deliver out drinks, bring us out salad and then bring us our pizza and then to bring us our check.   never ever checking on us to see if we needed anything else ( we had no silverware, there was no salt on the table, to see if we needed any refills on our drinks ) and when she wasn't at our table (which was not very often) I have no idea where she was   she was not where to be seen ( probably why she didn't take as good of care of us as she should have) And I mean no where to be see, no in the pizza making area , not at hostess stand , not at bar, not in any of the other sections, its like she left and came back very strange for a place that wasn't even busy.  ok next the hostesses were by front door talking to each other  ignoring everything else that was going on. The Manager (I assume He was manager he was dressed differently than everyone else and seemed to be giving out orders) seemed more like he was more interested in talking up a couple of different wait staff (female) and being Mr Player and important that he didn't even notice the lack of service we were receiving. Also the fact that The men's restroom trash can was overflowing with paper towels and  the sing was utterly disgusting and that the faucet on the right in the men's bathroom was just sitting on the sink, it was not attached to the sink in any way other than the hoses that supplied water. I washed my hands and kept my paper towel and was going to bring it back to my table rather than throw it on floor in restroom.  on the way back to my table there was a trash can about 7 feet from mr manager man that was completely full to the to that things were sticking over the top but not over flowing  I put the towel in there, I had to be careful or it would have been on the floor there also.  I sat back down and watched this manager talk to a server and then he threw something in the over full trash can.  I was thinking I can't believe he didn't have some one empty the trash.  It was almost overflowing.  a few minutes later one of the servers threw something in the trash, he walked over to the can and looked at it a few times and looked perplexed.  He called her over  I was thinking he was going to have here empty it, instead he asked her why she threw something away , and then she said why, and he and her both walked away from the trash can.   no one emptied it at all.  My lunch date said that the woman's restroom garbage can was not quite overflowing, but apparently the women there aren't as good of shots as the men because there 5-6 towels of floor in there.  and mind you this was around 5 pm on a Saturday afternoon at his time, before they were even busy, I can only imagine how bad it must get when the place gets busy
And I can only imagine that if this is the cleanliness that they have in their public, open areas, I don't think I want to know what happens in there not seen areas of prep, and refrigeration, and dishes.  Yuck

I would not recommend this place, not because the pizza wasn't decent, but more because of sanitary concerns and lack of attention to details from the staff from the manager all the way down to the servers,   I know that it all starts at management and I guess if the manager is more concerned with chatting the ladies up then running a restaurant, I guess this is how the details that are most important (cleanliness, customer service, appearance) don't really have time or priority to be taken care of."}
{"text":"They were in dire need of training in the beginning (beginning of June).... but I think they're getting more comfy now.

If you're gonna go,
go during lunch, and CALL IN your order.
Most things take 20-25 min to make.

I usually call in to go from the 5 dollar lunch menu during the weekday.

My fav: pepperoni pizza (gives me AWFUL gas in the afternoon tho lol.. a tradeoff)
or the meatball half hogi served with chips.
They have been consistently good.

Veggie pizza was tasty as well, but they only put itty bitty bits of toppings on the lunch portion pizza,... its mostly crust lol

First time: they don't pick up the phone.
I hung up, called again in about 10 min.
I was put on a length hold after they did finally pick up.

Food takes about 20-25 min to make once the order is placed.

They keep the food warm even if you're running late, so I thought that was kinda cool.

Usually the staff is friendly. Depends who you get but so far most of them have been very nice.

I don't drink soda but they have 99 cent refills if you bring their mellow mushroom cup."}
{"text":"This place is fine for a sports bar / family restaurant  with a hippy-stoner vibe.  
The service was fine, and the beer selection was good.  The ambience was a bit cheesy and corporate, the mushrooms all over the place were fine I suppose, and the magic school bus - but it did seem like it was trying a bit hard to disguise the fact that it is in a cookie-cutter building with no natural ambience.  Honestly, that didnt bother me at all.  I had a nice experience.

I just cannot get over the fact that this is supposedly the best pizza that Charlotte has to offer. I suppose if you like a thick spongy crust with cheese and butter baked into it, this place would be ideal.  For me it is not.  The combinations of toppings offered were not that appealing, though you can make your own.  I just found it quite mediocre.  Lots of flash which doesn`t make up for a crappy crust, a sause without tang, and too much cheese.

Where can a great pizza be found in Charlotte?  Where???"}
{"text":"Interesting place, i'm originally from New Jersey and used to that style of pizza but I think I can get used to this place really fast!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Mellow Mushroom a few times but the wait time (for food) is always SO long. I once thought they forgot about us, it seemed to take forever to get our pizza. Normally I might not mind so much but with a toddler, you have little time to wait. Good thing I had brought snacks!"}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner on a Tuesday and I thought the food was delicious and the draft beer list was one of the better in the Tempe area. I tasted the Fun Guy pizza and the Thai Dye pizza. Both were very good - the Thai Dye in particular was inventive. It tasted like indian food and pizza had a yummy love child. The service was a bit slow, but it was very friendly courteus."}
{"text":"My wife suggested I take our sales people to this place for a holiday lunch which for us also included some drinks. I dropped almost $200 at this place and cannot understand how this place stays in business. It was an off time since this place is right next to ASU and school was on break, but the food quality and service was horrible. Mostly the food but the service was barely acceptable. To start we ordered some of their pretzels, beer cheese, wings and some salads. Right out of the gate, they served us wings with rotting celery on the plate. I showed the waitress and she was like oh, we will get this fixed and go get new celery. She then brought back the same celery but cut in smaller pieces. I wish I had taken a picture...disgusting. We had to wait for beer a couple times and what I assume is the \"brew master\" served us twice and both times stuck his finger in the beer when dropping a piece of lemon in it. The pizza was no better than a grocery frozen dinner version and they obviously do not care about the presentation nor the quality. Given it is located in a school town, you would also expect it to be reasonably priced, but it is not."}
{"text":"I have some friends that love this place. I don't get it. For anyone from back East, this is not your traditional pizza.  Most of the pizzas that people rave about are the California take on pizza. Not a fan, but they do have more of the traditional pizzas also.  Those pizzas are ok. Nothing speical and I almost would say that several of the larger pizza delivery places can make a better pizza.

As for the service... it's an ALL TIME LOW of bad service in Phoenix.  I can't think of a place I have eaten at the consistently gets your food out so slow.  Doesn't matter what you order or how busy or slow it is. You are going to get SLOW SERVICE."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a really cool hipster vibe to it. I loved my burger and fries. All the staff is very laid back and kind. It's definitely a pricey place, but the food is great and the atmosphere is unique, so worth it, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Best pizza in charlotte in my book. Great kid friendly atmosphere, but cool bar area for grabbing some brews at the same time"}
{"text":"Yay! Pretty place for:
1. Girls nightout
2. Happy hours
3. Some yummy pizzas
4. Midnite girls' chitchat
5. In a great neighborhood 

My only complaint is they are bit pricey and very tiny veggie options even w/ pizzas & pastas"}
{"text":"I love some good pie and well this is great stuff. Not the best but also not the stuff that tastes like cardboard that you order to your dorm room in college ie. dominoes. The reason I have been going here religiously for the past month is TUESDAY NIGHT TRIVIA. Plus you know, My Man loves the Beer.

Pizza is solid like I said and either veg or meaty it is solid, nuff said. Beer here is pretty vast. Man has tried a couple then found a Blue Point Toasted and that has been his mainstay. I'm usually so dehydrated from being at the farmer's market that I'll throw back waters all night.

Service is on point. The bartender-dude is a pretty rad guy. Always takes good care. SO ANYWHOOOO this TRIVIA night is pretty fun. Lately they have been doing like decade themes and those are fun. The cool part is the round prize is a pint-o-beer or $10 gift card. Yup being smart and knowing useless things can actually pay off who knew? The music is lively and the hosts: Evelyn Rose are pretty cool. Yall should come and enjoy this awesome shin-dig Tue nights!"}
{"text":"Waited over an HOUR for an order I placed and was told 30-40 min. A guy came in and was given the wrong pizza. They stopped seating people bc they couldn't handle the \"rush\" (I saw at least 8 empty tables)."}
{"text":"Mellow mushroom has great food, vegan options,  and to me an exceptionally delicious crust on the pizza! The waitress was sweet and prompt. I really like the area and building of this particular one but have been to many and have always had an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Great beers. Great atmosphere. I travel a lot and it is my routine to make a stop at mellow the night I get back into town. It helps me relax and decompress after a long business trip. It's a great laid back place. Don't be afraid to ask for beer recommendations. The staff knows their stuff. Also try the Kosmic Karma or Gourmet White!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Thai dye pizza and it was pretty good! They have some very different flavors of pizza, which I really enjoy! The crust was my favorite part!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Awesome staff, extensive menu! Food allergy?  No problem!  The kitchen manager as well as manager both came table side to make sure I was happy with my choices (assured me they would make any item to accommodate my garlic allergy).  Food and service is amazing!  Thank you!  We will be back next time we are in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Ordered for take out pepperoni regular pizza and a veggie gluten free pizza.  Both were good but a little expensive.  Their take out area was well  organized so I was in and out quickly.  I will order again from them."}
{"text":"With a new bar menu being introduced all I have tried is the pretzel bites. Being a pizza place they have great dough and the bites go awesome with anyone of the 46 tap beers you can choose from."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite eaterys....we have been several times and it has always been delicious.love the beer selection,but usually stick with a good ole pitcher of guiness! The wait is usually long but its always worth it!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon so we thought we'd give it a try, not so much.  The hoagie was soggy and sourdough was dry. The pizza was greasy and tasted like cafeteria food. The large salad was hardly large and expensive. My recommendation...don't stop here, it's terrible if I could give them a negative star I would."}
{"text":"We had our first visit to the Mellow Mushroom today and we LOVED it!! We had the stuffed portabella which was amazing. Followed that with the house special pizza which very quickly disappeared. We cant wait to go back and try some more of the delicious sounding menu. Quite an impressive selection of beer as well! The customer service was great! Our server, Ashlie, was one of the best servers we have had anywhere in a long time! She even made sure our dog (sitting on the other side of the patio gate) had fresh cold water to drink! Above and beyond! Thank you Ashlie!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is really cool...a lot of awesome local artwork. Pizza is delicious and they have a ton of local beers on tap. Too bad the service absolutely sucked. We stood at the front waiting to be sat while every server stared at us. After getting seated it took a while for the server to get to us and get our drink orders taken which was not a big deal because it was lunch rush. A simple, hey I'm busy I apologize about the wait would have been nice though. Ordered 2 sandwiches and a small pizza which took 1 hour and 20 minutes. Not so happy at this point since the place has cleared out by now. Manager came over and took 50% off my sandwich since I waited over an hour to get the wrong thing which was nice of him but the bill was still $46 after that. I asked him what a normal ticket time is for a sandwich and he said 10 minutes...weird.  Moral of the story....order to go!"}
{"text":"Extraordinarily unimpressive. Set in the corner of a massive strip mall, the new building was soulless & noisy. Service & price are decent. However, the food is forgettable. A \"Greek\" salad consisted of: Iceberg lettuce, white onions, green peppers, cherry tomatoes, feta, pepperoncini, a few kalamata olives, & Caesar dressing. Iceberg & Caesar dressing?!  That's \"Greek\"?!  The cheese pizza was missing flavor & seasonings. Tried several methods of  \"spicing it up\" - with the addition of fresh basil, red pepper flakes, cheese, salt, pepper, even the Caesar dressing. While the texture of the crust was perfect, overall, the pizza was lacking. Comparable to an old Domino's pie, or even like a thin Costco Pizza. Especially disappointing when compared to several other independent pizza restaurants in the valley. The hippie-ish tripper theme suggests you would need to be high to enjoy this pizza joint. Mellow Mushroom, meh."}
{"text":"Great place to take out of towners to for a good pizza.  You really can't go wrong with any pizzas on the menu.  If you are a craft beer fan you will love their happy hour (half off drinks).  Best place on mill if you are looking to drink good beer and just hang out with a small group of friends.  Patio is perfect for watching all the drunk frat boy monkeys and their skeezy girls act like idiots."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals! My brother & I ate here on a Monday night during happy hour & we're totally happy with our bill. We ordered the spin dip, stuffed mushroom & bruschetta. All good choices. I recommend coming here for a late night bite, it will be worth it."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to this location of Mellow Mushroom last Wednesday. When we arrived, the hostess told us it as 1/2 off glasses of wine and $10.00 bottles of wine. We went to the bar to order a pizza to go, which was delicious, a beer, and a glass of wine. My girlfriend asked if they had Sauvignon Blanc. The bartender mentioned the name of the bottle and poured her a glass. He never mentioned that the wine wasn't part of the 1/2 off discount. The one glass cost $11.00, at a pizza shop! We could have ordered an entire bottle!! When we got the bill and shared our concern, the bartender rambled on about drinking good wine and how he worked at a wine bar, etc, even after my girlfriend told him she drinks any wine, red or white, and would have been happy with anything that was 1/2 off. Wasn't expecting any sort of compensation, mistakes happen,but the fact that nothing was offered, I'll reconsider where I drop $50 for a pizza and drink."}
{"text":"We love Mellow, esp during happy hour! The pretzels and pizza are awesome! Karma if my fav. Like that we can bring our young kids, there's always lots of other families there. Wish they had HH on weekends too. The staff is always super friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom never disappoints. Even when they are super busy, you never sit up front long. Ever time I have gone, I have been seated almost immediately. Yes, sometimes it takes a while for the food to come, but I would so much rather be at a table having a conversation and drinking my drink than standing or sitting in the lobby or outside. 

The employees are always super nice, which can only mean one thing: they like their jobs! Mellow Mushroom must take good care of their people to have so many nice, happy employees. Maybe they enjoy their jobs so much because of the fun location on Mill Ave- a college, single and ready to mingle area.

Finally, the pizza is delicious! I love the pizza with the Caesar salad on top. Sometimes I will get a small pizza for myself and do half one kind and half another. I like having options!  You will leave Mellow Mushroom a happy person!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for food on my way to Phoenix. Hostess complaining (rolling eyes) about fellow hostess \"What is she doing?\", she stated as four of us came in for lunch. Server okay, good about refilling tea ($2.89 for tea) and water. Ok service, nothing exceptional. Ordered a mushroom and cheese hoagie on sourdough with extra sprouts - told the waitress to have them put so many sprouts on the sandwich, the sandwich wouldn't be able to stay together. Rest of table ordered calzone and pizzas. Got my sandwich, waitress specified they put sprouts on top and bottom of sandwich. For a full sandwich at $10 with the smidge of potato chips, I really did expect more than what I got. Barely any sprouts (was charged the extra $0.99 for them). So in all my lunch was $14. Yeah, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The few times I've been here I've enjoyed the service, the food, and more so those Root Beer Floats! Yum Yum!! Ask for PJ, he's pretty awesome at what he does!!"}
{"text":"I'm really torn between giving them either a 1 or a 5, so I settled on a 2!
First, let me say that my issues have never been with the service. Everyone has always been friendly and attentive. Also, overall, I like the pizza. It's one of my favorite in town. Thus the desire to give them a 5.
However, the last 4 times we have gone to this Mellow Mushroom, there has been an issue with at least one of the items we ordered. 4 times ago, we ordered the pretzels. The parts we could eat were great, but the center of each one was raw. Not, just a little doughy, but raw enough to reshape them. They were busy, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt.
Three times ago, my pizza was burned. I would have sent it back, but they were slammed, and I didn't want to wait 30 minutes for another pie.
About a month ago, we ordered Key Lime pie for desert. It was frozen solid. Fresh out of the freezer solid. Even the little dab of whipped cream on top was frozen solid. This time we showed it to the waitress. She apologized profusely, and brought us a different brownie desert (which was very good). 
Tonight, we ordered a Thai Chicken Hogie. When they brought it to the table, it looked great! Presentation was fantastic! Too bad the chicken was cold. We sent it back. The next one they brought out was upside down on the plate, the bread looked as if they had torn in in half instead of cutting it, and half the chicken was on the plate and not in the sandwich. I appreciate that they comped us this sandwich, or we would have sent it back also. Overall, it was terrible.
After all these problems, sadly, I don't think we will be back. We like the people and the d√©cor of the restaurant, but I think from now on, we'll try the one on Happy Valley Road."}

Charlotte, North Carolina 28277



Dear Mark, 


I am writing to give feedback about our dining experience today at the Ballantyne location. Let's start with the two good parts of the visit. First, the pizza is always delicious. I travel for a living and have visited the locations in Winston-Salem, Selwyn, Johnson City, TN and Bentonville, Arkansas. Second, our server was accommodating and eager to please. 


Now for the not so good to worse. My wife and I ordered a spinach salad to split. It was served to us on one plate, no big deal. When I got the plate to split the salad, it was filthy. I asked a bus boy politely for a replacement. He decided to tell someone else to get me a new one. OK, let it go. We both ordered diet cokes. They came and were undrinkable. The taste was indicative of a fountain line that needed attention, cleaning or was not working properly. I saw a server ( not ours) and asked if she could replace our drinks with unsweetened tea. She passed that duty onto the bus boy who never got me the replacement plate. The problem was as she asked him to do this I noticed him cleaning his nose on the inside of his uniform shirt. We didn't drink much of our tea. When our pizza came, the server left our used forks from the salad for the pizza. She took them off the plate with her hands and put them back on our table. This has never happened to me at a Mellow Mushroom. I shrugged it off but it bothered me. Why is this? You have a prime location with a great interior, yet the service is sub par and the cleanliness was an issue. 


Some other things I noticed. There were staff members sitting at the bar. Is this a usual occurrence? I noticed the Manager on Duty. He seemed more interested in letting the servers know he was the boss rather than greeting customers and making sure their experience at Mellow Mushroom was positive and memorable. Moreover, I get the whole Mellow Mushroom tie dye thing. However, your manager was in need of a shave. Again, I tell you this because this experience was so unlike any other I have experienced at Mellow Mushroom. My hope is that your reigns get tighter and you give your location the personal attention it so richly deserves. Otherwise your customers will flock to  other options for dining. 


Respectfully,"}
{"text":"Excellent food.
Horrible service.

We have eaten here several times since its opening. Beginning with our first visit, we have had to experience lack of service. Sometimes, we wait forever to have our order taken. Sometimes, we don't receive refills. EVERY TIME, we wait forever for the check. How can you claim to value customers ( loyal customers at that!) when you forget they exist at all?! 

Several visits in a row, beginning with our first visit, we exchanged words with the manager. He was a great guy. It even became a bit of a tolerable joke that he would come out to respond to a complaint and it would be us. However, it soon became old. Not for us, but for him! He became cold and unaccommodating toward us, no longer offering compensation for the continued awful service. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect service. Not even great service, just any service at all would be great!

We still eat here occasionally. Why? Because the food is just. That. Good. Try the Eggs Benedict pizza on the brunch menu, it is incredible!"}
{"text":"Ok this place is pretty cool with it's take on drug culture and basically turning a places normal entree into a pizza.  I have had most of the pizza's but what surprised me the most was their beer selection on tap and in the bottle etc.  They serve Abita Springs Turbodog which is one of my favorite brown ales.  When you go here don't just get the hawaiian pizza try the Yukon Gold Hot Potato pie or something you can get a hawaiian anywhere these days.  the sandwiches are quite good as well.  It's a little pricey for drinks etc but they do run a nice happy hour 3-6pm I believe.  They have a bacon martini it's belvedere and a strip of applewood smoked bacon how could you not enjoy a chain like this?  I have always had good service here and it seems to me like it takes a little longer than most places if you order a pizza.  Don't get me wrong they go the extra mile with the ingredients etc. but you wait for it.  Also if everyone gets a 10 inch pizza most of them are around 11 bucks.  It's worth it but the pizza and a few beers and you are looking at 25 bucks plus.  So again I recommend the happy hour but anyone who loves pizza and beer should make a trip to any of their establishments."}
{"text":"Okay... if I were to rate this place only for its beer selection, happy hour deals, and amazingly cool and chill bartenders, it would be a clear cut 5 stars. However,  I just don't dig their food menu... I find the food too greasy, and I know how some may think that would go go with beer but for me it isn't working. Again, not bad by any means, especially the Caesar pizza (pizza with Caesar salad as a topping)
Make sure you sit at the bar and ask bartenders for samples of their ever changing beer list."}
{"text":"Just tried to get seated and no one offered to check us in. They have been open for 45 minutes but said they were still setting up the restaurant. Manager(bald male) or server came to the front and was rude, sarcastic, and unprofessional. We ended up leaving. Poor service in the door!"}
{"text":"After one happy hour visit, I can only give three starts. But I suspect that will improve during subsequent, and inevitable, return visits. I just can't say I'm a fan of anything after only one visit. 
Mellow Mushroom has an excellent beer selection, including several craft brews - including Orange Blossom, from Papago Brewing Co., and a couple of flavors from Four Peaks. 
I was really in the mood for chicken wings when I walked in the door, so finding out they were half off during their late-night happy hour was an awesome plus! Apparently, all appetizers are half off during happy hour too, which is great if you get the munchies while drinking.
Lastly, this place is open until 2 a.m. every night. This is unique in the Happy Valley/Anthem area and very welcome during the hot summer nights!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area, across the street actually and this place has fantastic beer on tap and good food.  I enjoy having a cold beer here after work.  
A couple of weeks ago I went to mushroom to watch a UFC fight.  The bar tender was awesome.  They set me up in front of a tv and switched the channel to FS1 and I enjoyed a UFC day with great beer, tasty food and a very kind and friendly bar tender.  So I thought, cool, this is the place to be.  I told my friends about it and we agreed to meet at mushroom for dinner, brews and UFC.  I arrived before my friends to get our spot.  When I arrived there were only 4 people at the bar.  Plenty of room for all of us. I then asked the bar tender if she could tune into the UFC fight.  She said, we do not show UFC here.  I then said, it's not on ppv it's on fs1 a channel you have here.  Her response was, we do not show UFC here. 
Hmmm I'm puzzled by this response with an empty bar.  Is it a policy you do not show UFC ?  If it is, I understand and that is your choice and she was absolutely right in telling me you do not show UFC.  Did the other bar tender break the policy by allowing me the chance to watch UFC in the establishment?   I am grateful the other bar tender was so gracious to show the fight. Only one other person came to the area I was sitting and said, alright they have the UFC on to his wife so no one was there to be put off the fight was on.  
I really like mushroom but I had to scramble to set up a new place for everyone to watch the fight and it was a big disappointment. Like I said I would be a frequent customer as I live across the street but I'm looking elsewhere now and my friends who had never been to mushroom certainly were turned off.  
I know you have a good clientele so you are probably thinking \" piss off\" to me but there are other establishments as well and now you have me searching for a new place when I thought I found a perfect spot.  3 stars for beer, food and coolness of some staff but could have been 5.  Lacking some aloha !!"}
{"text":"I originally tried this place with the groupon and didn't really know what to expect. After trying the pizza I wish I would've tried it sooner! It was delicious and I totally wish I could eat here every week. The ingredients were fresh and the crust was delicious as well. The prices are a little higher, but it's understandable as to why they are up there. The service was also super friendly and the atmosphere was a nice place to hang out with friends and family."}
{"text":"I love, love, love the pizza here. They have great beer selections too. They have traditional flavors and new variations. They had one that was a variety of olives on top - wow - it was great. Only draw back is it's usually pretty noise and hard to have any real conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"I understand that sometimes food doesn't come out as expected at times but even given this my family and I experienced  the worst pizza and or luck ever at the mellow mushroom. After a day of Xmas shopping we headed to the Mellow Mushroom. We have always heard good things about this place so we gave them a shot.  As we were seated everything started off great our server was nice and polite. We ordered a couple of hoagies and a large meaty meat pizza, after waiting 20 minutes for the pizza it arrived super dark, the bottom hard as a rock and you could see by looking at it that it was over cooked. We asked our server about it and she immediately said \" oh ya that is over cooked\". Well if it was so obviously over cooked why serve it to us? She then called over the manager. Manager Brandon apologized and offered to replace it and remove it from our bill. We thought great! As long as they made it right for us we were good and we thanked him for taking care of us. Well, after waiting about 15-20 minutes Manager Brandon came back to our table and said that there was a problem with the pizza and that they would have to remake another one because cheese being stuck to the bottom of a pan and they could get the pizza out without tearing. He offered us 3- $5 dollars off coupons on our next visits which at this point was not enough as I doubt we'll ever be back. Again, we thanked him and hoped for the best as we were freaking starving at this point. Finally an hour and ten minutes after our initial order our pizza arrived. Looked and smelled fantastic. We dug in and wouldn't you know it my wife finds a piece of plastic in her slice... Are you freaking kidding me!!! We politely asked for the bill, paid and left.... Not even mentioning the plastic to them.. For what? At this point we just wanted out of of there! I gave this one  star because Brandon did try to make things right but apparently he's up against a bunch of slobs in the Kitchen! Lazy, Lazy,lazy!! Advise to the kitchen staff, change careers!! You don't belong cooking to the public!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but both times I was really loving the service and food. The first time I went with a friend and it was pretty slow, but nevertheless we were able to enjoy our drinks and food. I ordered the cheese calzone and it was AMAZING.

The second time I went, it was a belated birthday dinner with my family. On a thursday night, it was PACKED. Luckily, we didn't have to wait long for a table and our server was awesome. Working at a restaurant myself, I understood that he was busy -- but he still made sure we were doing okay. The food this time around was just as good!  It is a LITTLE expensive, but in my honest opinion, the quality of the service and food are so worthwhile. 

I know I'll be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Srsly- best pizza ever.  Real food ingredients. Always fantasic service. Go for the Philosophers & a salad."}
{"text":"Had a party of 15 at 3 o'clock on a Friday for a high school graduation and they wanted us to wait an hour outside in 100¬∞ because they didn't have enough servers!
Asked for the manager and he confirmed they didn't want our business so we called buffalo wild wings and they got us right in.
I will never go back to the mellow mushroom I felt like they could care less about my business."}
{"text":"Thought pizza was great and had a delicious salad !! Good service liked the place kid friendly"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom - One of the most tight-lipped restaurants I talked to would only admit to the use of soybean oil, which is likely GMO - \"Soybean oil is a major ingredient in our pizzas\" they wrote to me in an email. Furthermore, when I asked about hidden MSG ingredients, they told me that they weren't required to tell me since they are not one of the 7 major allergens designated by the FDA and don't list them on their allergen list. So I decided to go use their allergen tool to see what they do list and found something shocking. The tool gives misleading, inaccurate and potentially dangerous information if you have a soy allergy. For example, I confirmed their crust uses soy, but when you use the tool, it says there are plenty of pizzas without soy. The information doesn't add up and regardless of whether if you have an allergy, I would not trust Mellow Mushroom until they release the full ingredient lists for their menu.

{"text":"Love this place!

They have a BBQ pizza with bacon.  How can you go wrong with bacon?  It is super yummy!!

The service is fast and friendly.  I would recommend this pizza place to anyone looking for something different with lots of flavor."}
{"text":"Love the salad you can pick each veggie for, but careful, it's $1/vegetable. Super tasty regardless of price. Nice clean restaurant. Speedy, friendly service."}
{"text":"This is a brand new location of my favorite restaurant in the world! I love Mellow Mushroom and I love having this one in the east valley. Just like any new restaurant, they are having some growing pains but the food is as good , great as ever! Highly recommend the Holy SHITAKE pizza!"}
{"text":"We visit this place because my wife likes the Gluten Free pizza.... I think the beer is pretty good. It's pizza so I don't get why they charge what they do. Seems a little pricey for what you get. BUT I've always enjoyed the service and after about 10 times trying to have the server repeat themselves I would just like to write everything down that needs to be said. It's so loud. Although my wife says I don't hear anything in a library either....

If you go ask for a booth.... I have not sat outside so I don't know about that. The bar area was good the onetime I sat in there for lunch. If you have kids ask to sit on the left side of the restaurant if they enjoy using public restrooms as much as our little one apparently does. Unless you enjoy the commute past everyone waiting for a table and the kitchen/server area (it gets crowded sometimes)."}
{"text":"Loved the laid back feeling at this restaurant. Our waiter was very nice, attentive, and definitely fit the mellow and casual theme. Buffalo chicken pizza was great! Overall the place was clean, and the prices reasonable. The only knock against this visit is that I ordered a beer and they served me the wrong one. I didn't say anything though, because it ended up being a better beer than the one I ordered!"}
{"text":"Great service from Keith. He gave us beer samples. Recommended food choices as well as beers. He was pleasant. Service was great. Food was great. No complaints here. I would recommend this place to those looking for specialty pizzas. No, it doesn't have that \"home made\" taste but it is delicious food. Come here with a group looking to please those with different tastes. I feel there is something here to please anyone's palate."}
{"text":"I went here last week because I was sick of Dominos and Pizza Hut. Ordered the magical mystery tour, it was awesome I recommend this place to people who wants to get away from their average pizza joint."}
{"text":"Horrible service, wasn't very busy and took over 10 mins to get someone to the table.  After having to ask for water 3 times we gave up.  Oh and the servers didn't know anything about the beers they served."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday evening with my bf for dinner. We love the Thai dye pizza and ordered half Thai dye with half of their house pizza. The pizza is delicious but they really skimp on the toppings. One slice of the house pizza had zero meat. And the whole half of the Thai dye pizza had about 5 pieces of chicken...which is where the curry flavor comes from. I think for the price they should really be more generous with their toppings. Especially on a large pizza! We sat at the bar so the service was pretty decent and zero wait time."}
{"text":"Went here on a lunch break, the service was relatively quick and the staff was extremely accommodating. The food was delicious, we ordered the hummus and a plain cheese pizza. Definitely planning on returning."}
{"text":"Had drinks with friends ..and love the pizza here!!!!its feels more like a launch place then dinner."}
{"text":"I went here for reverse happy hour because the deals on drinks and munchies are half off, but I experienced the worst service I've ever had. At first we ordered our drinks and munchies and they came out right away, so that was no problem. The problems started when our pretzels came out and we had no plates, silverware, or napkins. We asked our server Robert to get us those items. He left for 10 minutes and we didn't see him anywhere. Finally I had to walk to the kitchen and ask him for napkins. We then had to ask again for plates. Once my friend ordered another round of appetizers she needed silverware to eat it with. We had to ask again, and same thing happened. We didn't see him for another 10 minutes and had to flag him down from across the restaurant. Once we were ready for our bills we had to wait at least 30 minutes just to find him to ask for those. We were smart and had our cards ready so that he could take our bills right then to possibly speed up the process. We were wrong. He then disappeared for at least 20 minutes, and we noticed the table next to us getting aggravated to the point where one of the guys had to track him down to give him his bill. We waited another good amount of time, and could see he was just talking to someone by the kitchen. This service was absolutely awful and unacceptable. If you get a server named Robert, get seated in a different area."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting. Since they have been open nearly a year we thought they would have things perfected. We were wrong unfortunately. 

Starting with the positives: we really liked the funky interior and music as well as the staff we encountered. The place is much larger than we thought and wasn't very crowded. 

As for the food, we were left underwhelmed. As an appetizer, I ordered a spinach salad minus the cheese and it was good. My wife ordered the mushroom soup, which she said tasted great but was warm not hot. She also ordered the pretzels to share with our kids and they weren't anything special. 

For the main dish she got the Herb veggie burger and tried to sub a tossed salad instead of the potatoes. No dice but they did sub for steamed broccoli. Cold, wet and limp broccoli. Her burger was not good and she ate less than half of it. I should note, she was really hungry when we arrived so she really didn't like it. 

I ordered a vegan veg out and while it was tasty wasn't anything I would come back for. They also charge $3 more for vegan cheese which isn't stated anywhere I read on the menu. 

For the price, I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Great for taking the family out for a fun night or as a date night or just solo!  Beer selection is one of the best around, if you like good quality beers.  Pizzas rock!  Servers are also very friendly.  They hire the right people.  Try to pie with jalapenos....you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"House special GF pizza pretty good.  I'll stick to Fired Pie though for my own pizza creations at a cheaper price."}
{"text":"ive heard about this place from my buddies, and i came here and read the bad reviews. so i put off going , 

Yesterday, A few friends and myself  went   and found it amazing. i actually went back today for some more today haha. not to badly priced, There beerbatered cheese, is amazing on the pizza. 

 i did feel bad for the waiter because last night we ordered slices and he accidently gave us 8in personal pizzas, yet we only had to pay for slices, so it was overall amazing haha"}
{"text":"Such an amazing happy hour and fantastic bar service.  I can't speak for the dining room.  Pizza is delish."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and wasn't very impressed with the food or value either time.  First time, I tried the Jerk Chicken grilled hoagie (it wasn't bad).  When I asked if it came with chips, the server said \"yes, when we have some\".  The 2nd time I had the Meatball hoagie.  The \"whole\" meatball hoagie had 3 (yes 3) meatballs and was served with about a dozen potato chips.  So does that mean the \"half\" meatball hoagie has 1 1/2 meatballs?  The sandwich tasted OK, but I think would be better on their french roll (instead of the sourdough which I had).

I was very pleasantly surprised with the beer selection.  

The service was OK.

Overall, I thought it was over priced and the food was average.  I will say, their pizza does look good, so if I go back that is what I will try."}
{"text":"We had a great meal with friendly service. This is not a rush in and out spot so go there and enjoy it. Great local draft beer list. Perfect addition to Ballantyne for kids and adults."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, with options from healthy to heart-clogging. I trend toward the latter, and the Buffalo Chicken pizza is my go-to order, with garlic cheesy bread to start. The only thing holding this place back from five stars is the service. You will only infrequently see your server, and food does not come out super fast. I think it's worth the wait, though."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of great things about mellow mushroom, however my experience was disappointing. Our appetizers were really good but it took over an hour for our pizza to come out. My order is incorrect and cold . In addition when we told one or the waiters, all he said was \"oh sorry about that\". Did not offer to correct the order or bring out a fresh pizza! I will not be returning to this location!"}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner for the first time after meaning to make it there since we moved to Arizona a year ago, and it didn't disappoint ! They are mediocrely vegan friendly mostly by offering vegan cheese and already vegan friendly crust. For pretty much anything you do have to take out or sub things but still, to be able to have a couple pizza options a couple salad options and sand which options with the substitutions is awesome ! We also lucked out and got the only vegan server there, I believe his name was Shaun. He was really awesome as well and it's the best feeling when you are being served by someone who not only actually understands what veganism (seriously is there anything worse then when you tell a server your vegan and then they offer you items with cheese/eggs/seafood -___-) is but also lives their life like that (and you for sure know they aren't going to let you get a pizza that has real cheese or meat on it) So thank you mellow mushroom for the tasty pizza we will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"By offering a Build-Your-Own Salad I assumed Mellow Mushroom would be able to merely place the ingredients I requested into a plastic container and send me on my way.  This is apparently too much to ask.

After having our BYO Salad orders taken we were told that the \"Take Out Girl\" would be by to ring us up.  Who is Take Out Girl?  Is she a new Marvel comics character who flings doggie bags at ne'er-do-wells?  I hope she wears a cape!  No one, neither Super Hero nor mere mortal, comes by.  It doesn't look like anyone is even assembling anything resembling a salad (we can see straight into the kitchen from the order counter).  A good 7 minutes (it is 12:15pm on a Monday...perhaps ensuring the designated Take Out Counter is manned by the aforementioned Take Out Girl is again too much to ask...maybe she is fighting crime somewhere?)  We ask one of the guys making pizza if he knows the status of our salad and another guy yells from the back that he just started making it.

Take Out Girl appears (no cape), rings us up, then leaves again (she must be a very busy avenging Take Out orders).  More time passes and she returns with two plastic containers.  From the other side of the counter I can see there is a man hand-sized heap of artichoke hearts smothering my salad.  No other toppings besides greenery are visible.  Take Out Girl bags our salads and as we head out the door, an angry voice from the back of the kitchen yells something in audible so we turn to look.  He is clearly peeved as he hollers at Take Out Girl, \"Are you gonna let me give them their chicken?!?\"  \"Oh...yeah...\" says Take Out Girl as she goes to the back and returns with two smaller containers of something hot wrapped in aluminum foil fogging up the plastic.  I think Take Out Girl needs to find a new super power.

I decide to survey the situation in the office kitchen as I have a sinking feeling an autopsy of the salad I had hoped for is about to ensue and I need a tile floor.  After I excavate the half-pound of artichoke heart, I see all the shaved parmesan has been assimilated Borg-style into the artichoke heap.  Instead of the sun-dried tomatoes I ordered, a few unripe grape tomatoes line the perimeter.  There are three pieces of green pepper.  I then opened the container of chicken, unwrapped the aluminum foil and behold chicken breast that has never, ever been anywhere near a grill.  This is pre-baked, sliced and MICROWAVED.  I double-checked and the menu clearly states \"grilled.\"  Too hungry and too pressed for time to bundle back up this mess and walk back to the Mellow Mushroom, I try to force down some reassembled bits of spinach and chicken.  This salad tastes like disappointment.  And cost $13.48."}
{"text":"Great experience!   Read previous reviews and decided to chance it.  Capreese salad was fantastic!   The pizza 1/2 house 1/2 kozmo was delicious.  The food was fresh and the sevice, spectacular!"}
{"text":"Mellow mushroom is awesome. They have great happy hour from 3-6 and 10-close which is half off all alcohol and munchies. They have great wings."}
{"text":"The good:
- Pizza is quite tolerable
- Staff is friendly
- Environment is clean and relaxing
- You will likely get free food due to some mishap with your order

The bad:
- There will likely be some mishap with your order
- It may take 1.5 hours to get your pizza
- You may run into people you went to high school with

This is all you need to know."}
{"text":"This was the worst customer service that I have received in Phoenix. Initially I was super excited about eating here because I was hungry.  When we arrived at the restaurant there was no one in the front. We looked around to see if there is anyone around. The hostess came and helped the couple in front of us but did not come back to help us. We went inside and one of the bartenders helped us get a table. When we ordered we were not greeted with friendliness. The server forgot to put our appetizer order. The pizza that we ordered came semi cold. You can tell it's been sitting there for a while. Our drinks were not refilled. We had to tracks someone down to get our server to refill. We looked to see where she was and she was busy watching TV on the screen by the bar. The potatoes we ordered was dry and the menu said caramelized onions. It did not come caramelized. We ended up advising the waitress that we did not want that anymore. The overall taste of the pizza was nothing special. The frozen pizza you would cook from the grocery story tasted much better. The best part of the meal was the Coca Cola and the Sprite that my friend and I ordered.  When we left there was really no customer service and it just seemed like they didn't care much about anything.  I'm not asking for supreme service but at least some kind of service. We left there feeling really unwelcomed.   Would I ever come back here again? Hell to the no!"}
{"text":"Yuk.  Greasy, sweet, lacking sauce, lacking spice, and, frankly, any resemblance to a normal (good) pizza.  The pizza was like someone stole Auntie Anne's pretzel dough, covered it in Parmesan dust and butter and salt and grease.   Yuk.   Never again.   Drive to a Venezia's for a proper pizza."}
{"text":"Food-wise, I'm not a huge fan of fancy pizza.  But the pizza here I thought was just alright for the price, I have been to other pizza places that were cheaper and I thought were tastier, though some others with me thought the pizza was very flavorful.

I came with my family on a Thursday night maybe a 1.5 - 2 months back, and it was maybe 25% or less crowded in terms of max capacity.  The main negative per this review is the atmosphere and the acoustics of the building.  There was a noisy and probably drunk group of people on the right side of the building, and we were seated in the middle.  In spite of having a booth row of seats between us and them, the noise level was unbearably loud.  I requested to the waiter that they talk to the group and get them to be quieter, to which he replied that another group or two had said the same thing and they had mentioned it to the group, but if any corrective action was taken, there was no noticable sound change.  Part of it is the acoustics of the building, not muffling/isolating sound to different parts of the restaurant, but seriously, it was so loud that it was incredulously bad, I couldn't believe a restaurant could have this kind of problems in atmosphere (again, in part due to building itself, it seems).  I stuffed napkin in my ears to try and block the sound and it was still very loud.  So it made for a terrible experience as I could not really hold a pleasant conversation with anyone in that environment, and it amounted to waiting for the food to come so I could eat and get out of there.  I'm also a little hard of hearing, which makes the noise problem even worse that I was affected by it as badly as I was.

If going, and there's a hint that the noise could be a problem, I would highly recommend eating outside to avoid noise issues."}
{"text":"Mmmmm this place won't last a year in rocky river. I wanted to come to a new experience and go regular chain pizza. Don't get me wrong the pizza was above avg but doesn't compare to the local pizza place (Angelo's and a few others) I rather drive the extra 5-10 minutes for a local family own chain. Plus I'm a little bitter because I picked  this place over Sweet Melissa. Haha that will never happen to me again. EEEVVEEER!!!!
And the prices are absolutely high!
And they serve head hunter in a 10oz glass.  Which not one place in Cleveland does. Not even fat heads themselves???"}
{"text":"I wanted so badly to love this place! I had been looking forward to having vegan pizza since the opening was announced. We dined here the first few days it was open. There were a few kinks such as flat beer, burnt pizza and no accurate knowledge of ingredients. I chalked it up to the first week. I called and spoke with the kitchen manager regarding ingredients/allergy concerns and he also didn't know the cheese was actually soy free until I challenged him and he read the ingredients. For a place that prides themselves on catering to allergies/food sensitivities/preferences, I was surprised by his response to the his mistake.

I was so excited to try it again and attempted to order a pizza for take out tonight but was informed that they would not be accepting take out orders. The employee that I spoke with said the kitchen was too busy and to try back another night. I called at 6pm! I really wanted to love their pizza but am hesitant to try it and be disappointed again."}
{"text":"I have never actually had pizza here, but the appetizers, cocktails, and salads are awesome. Its usually really busy when I have gone so the time it takes to get your food is a little slow but totally worth it. I try to stop by every time I am in Tempe. I just wish they had opened up shop while I was in college."}
{"text":"Food quality was wonderful
House special pizza was delicious!
Some of the best Spinach Artichoke dip I have ever had.
Service was ok, other servers were a lot better.
Wait was about 20 minutes on a Saturday around 2.
Drinks are almost $3, no thanks
I could hear the manager unpleasantly complaining to the staff that there were too many dirty tabled and they needed to be bussed. although I agreed, I didn't need to hear her condescending tone during my anniversary lunch.

I will go back in future, after things have settled from the fresh opening and check it out again but for now I will continue to go to the Mill avenue location even though it is way out of my way and I have to pay for parking."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. First couple times I went here was pretty good. Had legendary service one night. I think the servers name was Ryan. The last time I went in is likely to be the last I go with my girlfriend as a date, which kinda sucks. She is vegan and it limits our restaurant options, but they were out of vegan cheese last time. We decided to grab something for me to go and get the heck out of there and grab something for her on the way home. It took an hour after deciding that to get my calzone. Now, I totally understand having to bake something but if it is going to take that long and you know it is now a take out order, you better say something. I would have been happier to just go somewhere else, but I feel like this was a major letdown."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now.  I love the unique menu options for pizza and it is fairly good but not great.  And for $13-$17 for what is basically a medium pizza I just can't help but feel that it's simply not that good.  Service is lacking to say the least and wait times even when slow can be way too long.  45-50 mins for thin pizza!?  

My wife is gluten free and her pie was very lacking.  She compared it to having cheese and sauce melted onto a chip.  

Brixx makes arguably a better pizza and is definitely more reasonable at $8-$10.  They make a very good gluten free pizza as well.  Also you are eating your Brixx pizza within 15-20 mins max.   Mellow Mushroom has fun decor and an eclectic menu but they're not enough to outweigh the negatives."}
{"text":"The menu is creative and the behind the scene demeanor is kind of quirky. The staff is fun and friendly. The beer list is extensive and has a lot of nice variety. The pies aren't too bad. I tried one of their sandwiches on my last visit and my husband had a calzone... Really tasty. I enjoy this place, for laid back casual dining."}

{"text":"Went there for a family celebration with a party of 8.  It was busy but we got seated in a reasonable amount of time (no more than you would have to wait anywhere else on a Friday night).  The service was outstanding.  Hosts and servers were very friendly and eager to please.  Even though we ordered something that has taken a while to cook at other Mellow Mushroom locations, we got our food very quickly and our drinks were never empty.  We didn't have to ask for a thing.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in here food is amazing! Service is way better at the bar then dinning room. Been to all three each one has different vibes but this jazz theme is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous amounts of quality brew on tap and bottles/cans...always a great idea for a lunch break ;). I've had pizzas and sandwiches o ' plenty here and liking all of them when I get them!  Service is generally quite fast and the wait staff are always efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place. Not traditional pizzas but all are really great. Awesome pizza crust!! Sandwiches and salads are equally great  (tried several throughout our visits). Terrific beer menu! Lots of choices.  Family friendly with indoor and outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Decent food, but really slow service. Our waiter did not pay much attention to us, but then when it took over 30mins to get our food, my 2 year old old started getting impatient. We come in for early dinner to get in and get out people!!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times, but the last time I went I was extremely disappointed with the service AND food from mellow mushroom. Our waiter definitely appeared to hate their job, the pizza and pretzel was very greasy, he \"mistakenly\" gave me a $120 bill for a small pizza, two beers, and a pretzel. The food took forever, and usually I don't mind waiting if it turns out to be good. Lastly the busser was ridiculously rude and reached across the entire table to grab glasses during mid conversation. Long story short Im not going back."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and had terrible service. They were incredibly slow. It took over 30 minutes to get our food. May I add that they weren't even busy! We were so frustrated that we ended up taking our food to go. And I forgot what my boyfriend ordered but it was mushroom something. The main ingredient for the thing was mushroom and they forgot that! Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Okay pizza, not spectacular. Biggest negative is that that pie and beers are overpriced. Impressive beer list but we had to leave our table to go to the bar to look at the bar menu. Servers seemed more concerned with being young and hip than offering help. Glad we tried it but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Very slow service. No one smiled and they made me feel like I was asking for a favor when I ordered. This is Rocky River, not NYC. Bill 82.00 for a medium pizza and apps they were only so/so. I would not advise coming on a Saturday night if you expect to be treated like a normal patron."}
{"text":"Great waitress! Bland pizza and overcooked pretzel appetizer. 

Hostess: friendly but needs improvement in dining room organization. We were unable to be seen (table of 3) due to the large party in front of us. 

Waitress: Our waitress' name was Nicole. Red headed young lady who hustled and made sure we were satisfied even though she was tending to several other tables. 

Food: Ordered the pretzel bites and unfortunately they were overcooked and burned. Also ordered a large maui wowi and house special. The jerk chicken was flavorless with too much jerk seasoning. The house special pizza was okay but the ingredients didn't blend well and slightly undercooked. 

The tempe location has tastier pizzas but the tempe location has HORRIBLE attitude-stricken and lazy wait staff."}
{"text":"The food here is great, especially the wings and calzones. The decorating of the restaurant is cool and funky, making for a fun place to eat. The service can be somewhat lack luster, especially when sitting outdoors."}
{"text":"Disappointing happy hour place. I have heard the other locations are better."}
{"text":"very good pizza
tons of beer on tap
great happy hour
reverse happy hour"}
{"text":"Very expense.  The patio is so so .  I wasn't overly impressed however the food was great ."}
{"text":"Food is great! Little bit on the pricy side, but very much worth it! I always get the soft pretzels and the cheesebread! So good! Their pizza is to die for! I love how they have the reverse happy hour too!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the bad reviews on this place.  I think the pizza is wonderful and the restaurant has such a great atmosphere.  I agree, I'm not going to wait over an hour to eat here, but when givent he opportunity to stop in for pizza and beer on a week night, I'm there."}
{"text":"I have been to several Mellow Mushroom locations and recommended this place to my co-workers. It was by far the worse experience I have ever had. A group of eight people and very few other customers we received poor service. It took a while to receive our drinks and once we got our food after waiting for over an hour, several personal pizzas were delivered to our table UNCOOKED. They returned their pizzas and the second pizzas they brought back were not what they order. They still even charged those guest. Several guest had major stomach aches from the uncooked food. A big disappointment for Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Great food and prices in a very clean casual restaurant.

We love the standard pizza and always get the Thai Die pizza.  

Decorations and furniture are pretty basic, but it's great for a good time.

Nice beer selection too.

Get on their email list for contests and specials.  I just got a $5 off coupon."}
{"text":"First time eating here and the appetizers were great...would have stayed for more and dessert but the cigarette smoke wafting in from the patio was not pleasant. They said after 10pm they don't monitor the patio smoking.  Good if you like to enjoy a cigarette (or another patron's cigarette smoke) while eating. 

We even moved to a booth in a room away from the bar to try to avoid it. Didn't make much difference since the smoking was right next to the bar.

Good food...good beer....bad smoke while eating mushrooms :)"}
{"text":"I will occasionally drive 35 minutes to the Mellow Mushroom just so I can devour an order of their cinnamon honey pretzels. And, yes, I devour all three of the delightfully doughy pretzels!

Pizza, hoagies, & calzones are the main dishes severed at MM. Both are good. As a vegetarian, I enjoy the avocado hoagie & the Kosmic Karma pizza. If you're eating clean, this is not the place for you. If you are like me & easily tempted by the awesomeness of dough, stay clear of MM!

This MM is a nice size with a space for outdoor seating. We've never had to wait for a table. However, I will say that the service, once we are seated, is never fast. If you're in a rush, pick another place. As long as the 'Shroom continues to serve cinnamon honey pretzels, I will be a patron."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it is close to my home & I think the name is so cute! I went twice within 2 weeks and that is enough for me to know I don't want to go back. I have to eat gluten AND dairy free (Boo Hoo) and I think \"Streets of New York\", \"Whole Foods\" and \"California Pizza Kitchen\" all make a pretty delicious, somewhat reasonably priced pizza. Not so with the Mellow Mushroom. The crust is super thin and doesn't taste very good. They charge a lot of money ($20.00) for a pizza that is 2\" smaller than their medium, but still hit you up for the medium price. Service is mediocre and I really prefer to spend my money with resaurants that don't treat me as a second class client."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in Gilbert! 1/2 price appetizers and 1/2 off my hubby's favorite draft beers! Reverse HH too! 10-2 pm."}
{"text":"Decent drink list.  Above average pizza.  Great Meatballs."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza. Delicious. Didn't try the beer but they had a lot. Fun ambiance. They were super busy yet seated my party of 4 as soon as we walked in. No wait. Nice booth too. 40$ for 4 people to eat. Before tip. Great place."}
{"text":"The food is quite tasty and the specialty drinks are good too. During diner hours and weekend nights the wait can be pretty long. This place is not for the light of pockets, prepare to spend $ when you come here. Atmosphere is good and very friendly staff. Not a bad place to cure your 'beer' munchies!"}
{"text":"I've been here almost a dozen times in the past two years, and while the quality of the food has always been consistent, the service is far from it. The first time I was here the host and wait staff simply great. The place had that new and eager-to-please vibe that you just love from a new restaurant. The kind that makes you wish for it's success. The 2nd time, was close to perfection as well. The 3rd however elicited a request from the manager to make sure the smart-alec jerk of a server stayed away from my table. Something was terribly wrong with the host staff as well. When we walked through the door they had that \"annoyed that someone actually showed up\" vibe about them.

It took a couple of months for me to want to give this place another chance, but when I did I was relieved that they hired some new faces that weren't anything like the last bunch.  Since them it's been a hit-or-miss from this place.

Today was a half & half day. The host staff (3 out of 4 of them) looked as if they came from a planet where you roll your eyes intead of smile when you greet someone, but waiter was friendly, timely, and attentive.  I've experienced this in quite a few places we frequent, as if the hope is that you'll eventually forget the dry greeting you recieved.  The food was as consistant and good as always, but the place wasn't very crowded. Actually, it's a good-sized place that I've never seen very crowded. In all fairness I chalk that up to timing.

I'll keep going back when I want pizza on the nights I visit the nearby movie theater, but if there were a nearby competitor, I'd definitely give them a try first."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. In the top 3 or 4 in Cleveland for pizza. Since pizza here takes a bit more time to cook, as they toss the dough and all that jazz, our 3 year old was losing her cool . The server noticed and went and grabbed her some fresh dough to play with. Very cool as my daughter was entertained for the remainder of the wait. I can't  wait to take my extended family back for more!"}
{"text":"I came here with my parents, sister, and 8 month old nephew. The music was way too loud, but I suppose we are not the chosen clientele.

We had the bruschetta, which I didn't like, and the Mediterranean pizza, which was absolutely amazing. Great crust and delicious combination of ingredients.

Service was fine."}
{"text":"We found hair, embedded in the pizza and the manager blamed us for it.  He stated his workers all wear hats . Uhh no! Yuck!!
If posting no stars was an option,  that's the rating this dump would get."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my default \"go to\" spots. Their happy hour is fantastic, and their beer selection is always great. 

You are always guaranteed a good time stopping in late at night since all the regulars are super friendly. The only thing that kept this from \"5\" stars is due to some of the staff leaving to open the Ahwatukee store."}
{"text":"Me and my family ate here for the first time and enjoyed the whole experience.  We didn't wait too long for our food and our burgers were hot and fresh and delishious. So you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"I love their food but service was not amazing. Maybe don't have enough staff for late night weekend traffic. Ordered pretzel bites as an appetizer and waited 30 minutes. Bartender never came to check on us during that time. My boyfriend's beer was empty and that's when she decided to come over and she asked if he wanted another. He did and he asked if she had put our order in for the pretzels. She said \"ya, it's in the kitchen.\" Last I checked, those should not take 30 minutes to make but what got me is she didn't even walk back to the kitchen to check on them!!! Another 15 minutes went by and someone else working the bar asked if I wanted another beer as my glass was now empty. I said yes and asked if he could check on our pretzel bites. Not sure if he was a bar back or another bartender. This whole time I had been watching people, who ordered after us get their food. He gladly went to check and explained that the printer in the kitchen had gone down and they may have missed the order but they would be right out and they would be removed from our tab. I was grateful he actually checked unlike the girl who took our order. She acted like waiting an hour for an appetizer was totally okay and didn't even apologize until she brought the check which didn't have the pretzel bites removed. They were a whole $3.50 so I didn't make a stink. I had a Groupon to use so when the manager applied that, they did remove the appetizer then. I get it, stuff happens but the way our bartender handled it is the reason I'm giving 3 stars. Those 3 stars are strictly for the yummy food... once I finally got it. If I was a manager at this joint I would have walked over, introduced myself, apologized and asked if there was anything else they could do but no manager ever came over. If the guy who ended up checking out pretzels is the manager... he's the only one who was busting his butt. Cleaning dishes, making drinks and cleaning up around the bar."}
{"text":"PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA

I love their PIES! its a nice cross between a thin slice NY style and a Chicago slice. Pretty decent toppings too. 

Their Menu is pretty unique, besides the pizza though, I dont think there is much to eat

Apps are pretty boring, Thai Stye wings are the rare exception.

Their toasted Subs are just ok, and thier deserts are pretty \"Cookie Cutter\"

Service is hit or miss, it seems like one course or aspect of my meal always goes wrong. if its not the app, its the dessert, if its not the wait on a pizza, its the wait on a drink. I think the pizza makes up for the service issues.

MIghty Meaaty is the way to go, or try the Egg and Panchetta.

Clean the bathrooms, I know its college town but vomit or pee smell is still pretty nasty."}
{"text":"Seated quickly tonight, a slow Tuesday night, but NOT in the dining area (where everyone else was seated) but near the bar?  4 staff standing around at host station, but NO dedicated wait-staff for us?  Bartender came 45 mins after salad and pizza to ask how food was and if we wanted refills.  No thanks.  Boxed the half of pizza while it was warm and left. Bartender chatting with customer/friend while staff who got our only drink swept in another section.  But hey--the floor got clean! 
  
C'mon, hard to make a bad pizza, and craft beers are everywhere, so SERVICE has to be what sets you apart from better, reliable venues nearby like Dewey's, Danny Boys, etc.  2 stars for the House Special pizza.

Bartender literally looked confused as my wife and I stared at her for something to drink...she had 3 people at the bar, one a friend.  Decor will never beat service.
Good luck."}
{"text":"First visit. Pizza was decent. Service was so bad it was funny. Party of 5 seated outdoors on Sunday with 2 waiters (one in training). They brought us simple drink orders and we said we needed a minute. They disappeared for 10 minutes. When I tracked them down inside they were standing around talking and then started WALKING AWAY from me. I asked them to stop and said we were ready to order. As in I wanted to give them my order then. They said they were going to get us plates and walked away. Several minutes later they took our order. Two pizzas. Place was not busy. Took 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Then while we were eating, the trainer waitress started clearing off a table (after complaining to another waitress about how it stinks to have to train) and she DUMPS A PITCHER OF BEER IN THE BUSH DIRECTLY BEHIND MY CHAIR. No joke. Thanks but no thanks for the beer shower & hilariously terrible service. Will never be back. Go to True Pizza in Piper Glenn where their service is EXCELLENT & pizza is DELISH!"}
{"text":"Lack of weeknight staff!

I am currently sitting with my family waiting for a table. Walking into the restaurant you will see several empty booths and not a soul sitting in the outside seating. At the same time you see 3 other families all waiting for tables while you wait for a hostess to come up front. Once the hostess does get to the front, you are told that there is a wait even though have of their available tables are empty. 

The food is awesome and my wife loves their beer choices, but I must rate according to the overall experience."}
{"text":"Wow, this is some big pizza! We went with my brothers groupon deal and got a ton of starter pretzels and two enormous pizzas. The menu is wacky, the food is delicious. There is a pleasant atmosphere and the service was pretty great. I will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best pizza! Great lunch special too! Personal size pizza for $4.99! Not too greasy and a great flavor! The house salad dressing is awesome too! Great atmosphere with indoor and outdoor comfortable seating! TONS of beer on tap! Big screens for sports watching! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Don't do it.  I rarely write reviews that say don't go. But I have to be honest. My mom and I went in for dinner around 6:30 and were sat. We didn't see our waitress for 15 minutes. She said she would be right back. Then 5 minutes later we saw her. We told her we were trying to make a movie so we needed to be quick (not to mention we had been waiting in-served for 20 minutes). She apologized saying that there was a 50 top.... WHAT!!!  The restaurant was only half full!!!! This is unacceptable. There were 6 hosts/hostesses standing around. And no servers in site not many tables with food on them. And the poor high school aged server lost our table because we walked out. (We went to the down the shopping center to have dinner.)"}
{"text":"I came out for the first time about a week ago with some friends and I felt like the service more than made up for any imperfections and made it a good night. We went because we had heard about the long beer list, and that hype was proven true as I was a fan of the three or four I tried. I got the Kosmic Karma, and the tomatoes and red peppers on it tasted fresher than I expected. The wait for the food was a bit much (we waited probably 40 minutes after ordering), but our server (I made a point to remember this one: Gretchen) was gracious about it and was able to give us perfect beer recommendations. I could see stopping in every month or so now."}
{"text":"Driven by this place plenty and finally decided to stop by for lunch...

Worst idea ever! Waiter was extremely arrogant and could care less. 

Ordered 1/2 of a meatball sandwich ended up being a big piece of bread with 1/1/2 tiny meatballs. Friend wasn't satisfied with his meal either. Complaints fell on deaf ears with management, our satisfaction was not a priority.

Supposedly large selection of craft and micro beers, 5 of the 7 beers I asked for from the menu were not available.

Wish I could post with zero stars. Would not return nor recommend."}
{"text":"My first experience here was good and my second was great! All thanks to the great service from our server Sophia taking us through the menu and her great suggestions! If it's a midday snack or a late night eat this is the place to go and if your in the Tempe location ask for Sophia."}
{"text":"We were seated in the dining area as happy hour was about to end. It took about 10 minutes to get the attention of our server who claimed he was short handed. Even so, service was pretty slow and lackluster. None of the service stuff seemed to be moving quickly, although there were a lot of them. 

At the time we were there, they also had an issue with their exhaust from the kitchen because you had a lot of the kitchen's smells coming in the dining room. By the end of the evening my clothes had the same smell infiltrated as well. 

All we had were appetizers so I can't really comment on the whole menu but the slow service and dysfunctional exhaust pretty much told me I shouldn't be coming back."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on this place. Things I like have matching downsides.
 
Pro: The pizza is very good and they offer a lot of off-the-beaten-path pies so you can try something you've never had before. They certainly have their own style so don't expect a copy of NY or Chicago-style pizzas.
Con: You better bring some loot; this is some pricey pizza.

Pro: At happy hour, you have 1/2 off of (basically all) drinks with a very good draft selection.
Con: Only appetizers are on special (and they aren't too good). Pizza is not on special. Beer off of happy hour is also pretty pricey.

Pro: he service is friendly and quick (especially if you sit in the bar) and the place is clean, open, and bright.
Con: Groups larger than 6 might have trouble getting a table.

Nonetheless, I do end up here once in a while and I leave happy.

EDIT: within a few hours of posting my review, the owner Jay B., sent me a message to address the \"cons\" on my review, justifying higher prices with the use of premium ingredients. It was a nice to see the personal interest he takes in his business, even though he called me \"Mark.\""}
{"text":"If this was a review simply for the food I would give this place five stars. I LOVE Mellow Mushroom pizza. The crust is simply amazing and their pizza choices are amazing. Red Skin Potato Pie? YUM! The sandwiches and appetizers here are really great too. 

If this was a review simply for the delivery I would say four stars with one star off for not offering any drinks for delivery. Pizza's just not meant to go with water and we don't keep any soda at home. Although we did one time luck out with a guy who was kind enough to send two cola's over in plastic to-go cups. Thank you guy!

It's the service at the establishment itself that brings the score down to three stars for me. The first time we actually went to eat here was earlier this year after my mom had just flown in for a visit and was ready for dinner after a long flight. Since this place is close to where we live and I already loved the food from the few times we've ordered it I suggested we stop in. The food was good but while my mom and I ordered appetizers and received our food in a decent amount of time my poor boyfriend waited forever for his small pizza. By the time we got it we had to have been there about an hour and he ended up getting a box for it right away so we could finally go.

The second time we went with a group of friends and the service was better this time around but I have to say the noise from the bar area kind of put me off from wanting to go back in. Picking up from the location is a bit annoying as well, as we had to go back to the loud bar area and try to catch a bartenders attention so we could pay for our order while he fetched the pizza. Granted I know that on a Saturday night a noisy bar is to be expected but I think we'll stick to delivery from now on when we want to enjoy this delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Have you ever walked into a place and been not only greeted by name but the bartender knows what you drink / eat?  Oh, and this person is ready to serve you (already making your drink)!  Having traveled for a work for many years, as well as a background in the service industry, this type of service can be few and far between.  When Mellow Mushroom opened uptown, honestly, I had my doubts.  I have visited them in MANY towns.  I have found that they are typically rather run-of-the-mill, however there is one bartender in the Uptown Charlotte location that stands out.  

Please don't think twice about walking past Mellow Mushroom Uptown and stopping by to see Ran-D (okay, it's Randy).  I have first-hand seen him go above and beyond to ensure that every drink and food order exceeds customers' anticipations.  Such expectations are far beyond what you may find at a typical bar or restaurant.  Do yourself a favor, swing by MM Uptown, sit at the bar, and make sure you ask for Ran-D.  *And please tell him that Jennifer T. sent you.  ;)"}
{"text":"Hubby & I were looking for a place to have dinner last night. We were around the Norterra shopping center so we drove around checking potential spots out. We came across Mellow Mushroom & decided to give it a shot.

It's very bright inside with a modern, funky look. The booth we sat in had a pic of the Orpheum Theater next to it. We thought that was neat.

Our server was a cool dude & literally named/described every beer on tap. I decided on a raspberry wheat & Hubs got some type of amber. We both were pleased. Too bad we missed happy hour prices though!

For an app we ordered the pretzels, half salt & half garlic parm. They came with mustard & marinara sauce. They're pretty big so we would have been fine with just a half order but we took the leftovers home for a nice snack the next day. So good!!

For our pizza we ordered the house special. While I thought it was pretty good, my hubby didn't. Said all the toppings were overkill.

Our total came to about $45, not including tip. I guess not too bad for two 16 oz beers, a soda, an app & a medium pizza. While we overall enjoyed the meal we won't be in any hurry to come back."}
{"text":"Waited forever. After 2 hours waiting for a pizza I received a bill with ZERO compensation. Any smart manager/business owner would see a table sitting over an hour for a pizza and at least compensate a round of drinks. Nope! Not the case. 

Atmosphere is open air cafeteria style and noise level was a little ridiculous. 

I just paid my 50 dollar bill and can promise the owner/manager/anyone reading this that I will not be back. Ever. I might consider take out but if you tell me the wait is over 20 minutes I will decline and get a digorino pizza and eat it while listening to 70s music. It will cost me a fraction of the cost."}
{"text":"Other than the blank stare from a not so hospitable hostess when we first got there, the service was great! Our server was very patient with our toddler and the food was delicious. Best appetizer was spinach artichoke dip and the Meat pizza was chock full of many delicious meats. Fantastic craft beer selection"}
{"text":"Cheezy movie theatre entrance. Food service quite slow. Waited more than hour for food. Plastic plates and you need to shine your silverware with the napkin. Son asked for make your own pizza but they make it. Previous establishment had real make your own pizza that the kids loved. Wife (40s) with pre teens was refused beer due to lack of ID. She should be happy! Was not a good first impression of the newly opened restaurant."}
{"text":"One meal was missing an ingredient . 
The manager came to the table, reeked of smoke and while resting  his dirty fingernail hand all over our napkins,  proceeded to tell us we were wrong.
The other meal was not prepared as requested.
The server was friendly enough and had the kitchen remake the order.
The manager delivered the Re do and proceeded to try and convince us to take the food mistake home.

He then tried to guilt us by telling us how they do not like to waste food, wow, real classy.

Not to mention the food tasted like s***"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after riding dirt bikes in the desert. We have had Mellow Mushroom in Georgia and Florida, but this one was top notch.  Very clean, staff very friendly , and food OMG to die for. 

The garlic cheese bread is fantastic, and the calzones are my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is great! Used a groupon and there wasn't any issue and in fact it was pleasantly dealt with!  

The pizza is mouth watering and the atmosphere consists of singing customers and enough drinks to make you feel as if your at the Yard house!"}
{"text":"Holy terrible service!  First of all you should never have to walk up to the bar to get your drink that you ordered.  You should never have to ask for your check, and you should NEVER be within ear shot of the drama that obviously goes on at the ahwatukee location!  Management need's to step up and have a refresher with the kids about professionalism, customer comes first, geez the list goes on.  Oh! and did I mention the manager yelling at the bar girl for a couple that walked out because the service was so slow.  OH!  and the best part is that it was soooo slow when I was there on Sat that I could here cricket's.  Hmmmmm my beer was good though lol.  If I may make a suggestion, I know it's a happen area; however, pita jungle has always been a fav of mine, and of course RA.  Unfortunately if your looking for a cool place like I thought MM would be....I would maybe give a bit until they get their act together.  Oh yeah, the food, well......the pretzel's were not bad; however, they do take up to 25 to make and the beer cheese was cold and already had a layer over the top.  I'm guessing because they were done and sat for awhile.  Who knows.  Good luck if you choose to go to the Ahwatukee location :)"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour!! Reverse happy hr daily. 10 pm - 2 am. Tons of beers on tap, there is something for everyone"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and the service!! You must try the holy shiitake pizza....amazing!"}

Stay away from this place if you are looking to have good food and a relaxing meal."}
{"text":"I work around the Desert Ridge/City North area and the service here is always SO slow. We love the food but we always have to plan ahead what we have to order so that we can get back to work in a reasonable time. 

It is never very busy and it takes long whether there is 4 of us or 6 of us. I can't imagine how long it would take if there was a wait!

Management really needs to address this...."}
{"text":"This is just what River needed. The build your own salad could get expensive but it's nice to have options. We had a cheese pizza it was cooked perfectly! Also our server- Mary Beth was so nice.  They were very busy so it did take awhile, but it was worth it have have a hand tossed oven cooked pizza!  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for our first visit with including our 3 year and 7 month old grandsons and as expected, were keeping our fingers crossed.  All was great!!!   The kids menu afforded the 3 year old his options and the Mac n cheese was perfect along with the apples and lemonade.  He loved it.
The staff was attentive and friendly and brought pizza dough over for the kids to play with.  Great concept that not only worked but was appreciated.
The adult pizzas were very good and the options are awesome.
Keep it up!   We will be back to try some other options"}
{"text":"Great food .... awesome country mix playing in restaurant, with hard rock playing almost as loud in kitchen = bad headache. Had to leave before I could finish my beer or one piece of pizza :-("}
{"text":"I took visiting family members here after the St Patrick's Day parade.  It was crowded and extremely noisy, but the pizza never disappoints.  The side salad was a little small and bland, but I got what I ordered I guess.  We (3 adults/one child) were sat at a hightop near the bar even though low tables appeared empty.  I regret not asking to move."}
{"text":"The pizza here is top notch. I like the prices. We think the service needs some work. They were slow getting to us after we were seated."}
{"text":"Not just  a regular pizza place. Hnd tossed doe makes a big difference. Great flavor and portions.would definitely recommend and eat here again. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow.  When my pizza was finally served, it looked golden brown. However it tasted burnt.  When I turned my slice over to look at the bottom it had multiple small burnt black areas as if they baked fresh pizza dough on a dirty pizza pan.  Needless to say, that realization was so disgusting that I was unable to consume my pizza.   The location was the Selwyn Ave. location. I have not tried any other location."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times and it's a decent bite (pizzas are unique, in a good way, their sandwiches...not so much) but after reading the reviews, I find that I've had a lot of the same experiences as others.  Just something about this place...Seems to be full of pure arrogance.  Their indifference to issues is annoying.  Our group was basically told our business wasn't valued.  When an email response was later sent on their website, the \"owner\" responded that it was their \"policy\" and if we chose not to come back, that was our choice.  Makes you feel like you want to support this business, huh?  Not!  There are just too many great businesses out there that want my business to support an \"owner\" so arrogant that customers aren't his number one priority.  Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, fun drink selections and decor"}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but the wait is terrible. I waited for 20 min already and then they came out and said they dropped the pizza and would have to wait just another ten minutes. So after about forty minutes of waiting the pizza came out. They have a great variety to choose from. Their Yukon Potato pizza tastes just like a baked potato! Very yummy. Price is good, but service is lackluster. Food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious but the service is always outstanding. I've been here many times and always leave fat an happy. They also have an amazing happy hour."}
{"text":"Big disappointment.

We had family from out of town and my daughter recommended to try Mellow Mushroom in uptown since she enjoyed the one in Charleston, SC.

First off, it took a long while for someone to come to our table after we were seated. The place was not busy at all. There was nothing going on uptown--no games, no concerts.

Our server finally came and she turned out to be super sweet. Really. Nice friendly smile. Seems genuine. Our order came about 45 minutes after we ordered. Our server said enjoy your meal and disappeared before we can say, we don't have silverware! We all had salad to consume. We finally got the attention of another staff to give us some silverware.

As for the food? The caesar salad was nothing special and they were served in this half-plate, half-bowl to make them look like there's more than there truly is. The pizzas? We ordered the Thai and the one with the portabella mushroom. Nothing could be more boring. Taste bland. No traces of garlic where they should be at least in the sauce! Pizza and garlic no matter how faint should go hand in hand. I showered mine with Tabasco sauce and red pepper to give them more taste. Dough, well, too doughy. Heads up on that one.

BTW, I had to tell our server that chunks of old cheese were stuck on my menu. Isn't that a health code violation? So, wrong.

I work uptown and I have to say that this will be my last choice if eating out. Last, as in after Panera bread and Subway.

The location is great! It will continue to be busy, but most likely will not have a loyal following."}
{"text":"With this place being so new, I expected growing pains, but we did not experience any. Service was very friendly and our server Marlo was great. They had a nice beer selection and a good variety on draft. 

We ordered the wings and chef's salad to start, with their house Esperanza dressing, and it was awesome. Got the Kosmic Karma pizza and it actually came out pretty quickly - about 20 minutes. I noticed they have garage door openings at the front of the restaurant, which will be nice with the patio once the weather warms up. 

The decor is what you would expect from a Mellow Mushroom location but a tad on the cleaner/crisper side...not as hippie. Overall we had a great experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Upon entering Mellow Mushroom the Hostess stand is about 20 - 30 feet away from the door.  Just recently I underwent foot surgery on both feet so I walk with a cane and have those special black shoes they give you until you recover.  The Hostess not only didn't greet me upon entering but proceeded to walk me back to the farthest part of the restaurant.  I stood my ground, pointed to my feet and cane and asked for a booth much closer to walk to.  Next came the waiter who dropped off menu's, no welcome to Mellow Mushroom my name is ----- how are you and what can I get you to drink.  Nothing, no personality at all and before he left I asked for a manager.  I got Andrew who knelt down so we could be face to face and I expressed my view points with the hostess and the waiter whose name I still don't know. He said he would talk to his staff about my concerns.  After we were re-sited I asked for the manager again.  Out came the general manager Blake, I again expressed my view points but he wanted a \"pissing\" match with me instead.  He wanted to know how many restaurants I had opened, I said I've been in the Hospitality Industry since 1980. I also worked in the customer service department at American Express for many years.  I asked him why the employee's don't wear name tags,  Because it is \"Corporate Policy\" not to wear name tags as express by the general manager Blake.  Well I like to see the person's name who is serving me.  I asked him why the employee's are allowed to show their tattoo's, again it is \"Corporate Policy\", if you got them, show them.  Well I don't really want to see someone else's art serving me, although I have tattoo's when working professionally, you won't see them. I have traveled across the United States working and eating in some of the finest restaurants, but I've come to the conclusion Mellow Mushroom is run by some 40 year olds who really don't see the bigger picture.  They hire general manager's like Blake who I may add had been the rudest and most condescending restaurateur I've ever met and I've met a lot.  I guess I'll be getting my pizza someplace else."}
{"text":"My family was being a little crazy so we needed an escape! This place saved us! We are so happy with the service and the experience!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is NEVER busy which is a sign that something is wrong but I have been here many times & continued to give them a chance. I am not the kind of person that writes reviews but I have to review this restaurant so others are aware of how they run their business. Although I've been to this location at city north many times in the past, last night will be my LAST.

On multiple occasions we have been waited on by a waiter & waitress that smell like smoke. I'm not a smoker and I don't mind if others smoke but I do not want a waiter who is serving food to my kids food to smell like an ashtray every time he/she walks up to the table.

Last night we were treated terribly by the manager. We choose to go to mellow mushroom with some of our friends for dinner (32 of us in total) because there was a groupon for $20 worth of food. We ALL purchased the groupon  and sat at 8 SEPERATE tables and all had SEPERATE tabs. At the end of the meal, the manager was RUDE and ARGUED with us all about why he could only allow ONE of our tables to use the groupon because we were considered a \"group\"!  He told us he would lose his job if he allowed every table to use a groupon. The fine print on my groupon states limit \"one groupon per table\" which is what we had!!!!!

If it weren't for our 32 people, the restaurant would have been empty!! We brought a big group of customers to them last night and we were not treated like they appreciated the business. 

We will never return to this restaurant for dinner and will certainly NEVER plan a group event there again!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, no complaints there. But I went to the bar here late night and the bartenders have their heads up their asses. It took around 20 minutes to get my first drink, so I  only ordered one drink for obvious reasons. It took another fifteen to get the check. We practically had to beg to pay for our drinks. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot about this place and was pretty disappointed when I finally made it.  We ordered a pizza and it was very so-so, all crust, very little cheese and toppings.  I do have to give them credit for their beer list though, quite the selection on tap, but the food just wasn't very good."}
{"text":"We went to Mellow Mushroom as a family for the first time. The hostess said it would be 35 minutes to wait. After nearly an hour the Manager apologized but offered no alternative other than to come back another day or wait for a table which could take up to another 20-35 minutes. The hostess then came back and said they had 2 hi top tables for us. We explained that we had 2 kids in high chairs who would literally be sitting under the tables because they were hi tops. The hostess seemed frustrated that she had set up the tables that we would not be able to use. After nearly 2 hours of waiting our food finally came. While the food was good, the service was awful! I'm sad to say the wait was not worth it,"}
{"text":"Really wanted to come listen to the SEC game but they won't take off the Christmas music! Such a bummer, go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Let's say Justin at the Stapley location in Mesa, is the type of manager that will keep your restaurant running smoothly and customers happy. He caught a problem with or order before it left the kitchen. He addressed the problem, appolgised and corrected the problem. Outstanding manager. Thanks Dustin"}
{"text":"When my husband and I want to head out and grab dinner and a couple of beers, there's really only one choice on this side of town: Mellow Mushroom. 

I love the food - salads are fresh, sandwiches are tasty and the pizza options are perfect. The fact that we can sub in vegetarian protein options without any hassle at all is a huge plus - it makes us feel really welcome. Every server we've met is always great about helping us choose a delicious pizza. 

We really come for the beer, though - the beer and the advice. With so many different options, it's easy to get a little lost in the tap list. That's why I'm always glad to see Ryan working. Not only is he really knowledgeable about beer styles, he's always able to recommend anything from an IPA to a sour to a stout on nitro - whatever we're in the mood for. Best of all, he takes the time to talk to us about out options and has helped introduce us to new styles and breweries we might have missed out on.

So tasty food + great service + expansive tap list + spot on advice from Ryan = five stars in my book. And I just talked myself into where I'm going to dinner tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. That's where the positive review ends. Overpriced 9.50 martini for wife was small and tasteless. Pizza greasy and not anything special."}
{"text":"It has been a while since we've been here, as we're not really down for spending $20+ on a single pizza. Don't get me wrong, the pizzas are pretty good, but I don't see how they're worth that much. One of the main reasons that we haven't returned is because of the spinach artichoke dip, or rather the waitress serving it to us. Again, the dip was good, but the amount in the bowl was tiny and they gave us only a handful of chips to use. We munched through the chips pretty quickly and the waitress came by and asked if we wanted some more. She brought another small amount of chips so we finished those off and decided we wouldn't hassle her again. When she brought the bill, though, we were astonished to see a charge of $3.99 for an extra order of chips. Since when does any place charge for chips, especially tortilla chips in AZ? And shouldn't she tell us that there's an additional cost if she's going to offer them to us? The spinach dip incident, coupled with some outrageous prices for sodas and the spendy pizzas, has driven us away for good!"}
{"text":"I always hate when you go to a place that's been hyped up just to end up generally disappointed. The pizza wasn't bad---it just wasn't anything too special like I expected. They have a lot of options for toppings which is cool, as well as some interesting appetizers. I did like their crust, it was crispy on the outside but nice and fluffy on the inside. Really, it just reminded me of pizza I've had a million times though...better than your huge chains like Pizza Hut and Papa John's and probably on the same level as places like NYPD and Streets of New York. So, it wasn't bad. I will tell you that the pizza warms up horribly though in the microwave! A large (16 inch) pizza is about 25 friggin' bucks so I want to eat all of it, leftovers included, but the crust cooks too much and becomes hard while your toppings are still cold. So, you either enjoy the crust and not the rest of the slice OR enjoy the majority of the pizza and not the crust which you actually enjoyed. Service isn't that great, I feel like this is a trend on Mill. They do seem to have a lot of options as per beers and whatnot, I'd expect they'd be a cool place to go for happy hour. 

So, overall I won't be trying them again. If I wanna pay a lot of money for a pizza I'll go a block over to Oregano's where the pizza is cheaper, bigger, and more enjoyable in my opinion. I really was hoping for more from this place."}
{"text":"Nasty!  This establishment is managed very poorly.  Waited over an hour for a pizza, and was teated poorly by the management.  Unreal!  Do not go here.  Poor Management and Service.I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"(GOOD SERVICE!!! MEDIOCRE PIZZA!!!!!)....This is my second time trying mellow mushroom, I originally had it back at the one in Tempe, the pizza was very soft and the crust was AMAZING!!!, sadly this location didn't taste the same at all, a total U turn in pizza quality...When we first walked in we were seated in the back next to a larger group and we didn't get service for roughly 4 mins, but this was because the servers couldn't see us...Are server was nice, she was very attentive and kept stopping by the table to see if we needed anything so thats good, but the pizza is not as advertised and doesn't stand with the hype, the pizza I ordered was the house special with a half Maui wowi, and the Maui wowi was very peppery, waaay to peppery, I mostly took off the jerk chicken to taste less pepper, then the house special was alright but they put too much parmesan cheese on the crust and it made the pizza really dry, I also ordered some pretzel bites that tasted more like little begals, and on both orders we had scraggly leftovers from other foods, the prezel bites had a small piece of dry bacon that was burnt, and on the pizza there was a scraggle piece of onion under the pizza I will post a pic of this...Long story short I will not go to this location again due to the way the food is served."}
{"text":"I've been to many a Mellow Mushroom and the food at this one is the worst.  Crust is good on the pizza but then it goes down hill from here.  The toppings (if they actually have the one you want) are bland.  I ordered a pizza with pineapple and ham.  When pizza arrived the bartender said we are out of pineapple but we made the pizza with the ham.  If you'd like we can take the ham off.  We had another pizza they advertised as only at their store.  It was bland too. Wings taste like they have been reheated multiple times.  No crispiness.  Garlic pretzels were the hit of the menu.

This place was actually closed on one visit because their food order didn't arrive. Yes they ran out of food. Poorly managed place.  Two stars for beer selection"}
{"text":"They quote you a ridiculous time of 40 minutes( for pizza, mind you)--only to have it take 90--with the place empty.  Manager told us it's a problem with their ovens.  Go to deweys down the street.  Worst dining experience I've had in years...avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great pretzels, awesome atmosphere. I had a salad - the spinach something. The ingredients were very fresh. I ate some of my hubby's buffalo chicken pizza. So so yummy. The crust is delicious!"}
{"text":"ordered their (original or famous first one on list). ordered thin crust crisp.  It was soggy 1 slice nothing on it next slice a little next slice several items one on top of other. waited several weeks after opening so the training time was up.  Pizza bad service helter skelter.  Friend ordered root beer no serve, I  asked what they have for non-alcohol beer, he gave me a look like I was crazy to ask with a simple non.  sorry would of been nicer.  I think waiter just did not know the menu.   I find it hard to believe a pizza joint no root beer or non-alcohol beer.  l$28.00+ pizza with just a splash of toppings.   Good luck  very poor value."}
{"text":"Went to the MM when visiting my BFF and her family in AZ. This place was super relaxed, great for kids and the pizza was yummy. Wish they had a MM in Texas."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! 50/50 Thai and buffalo chicken. Thai was amazing! Buffalo was still really good. Waitress Joanna was very informed and attentive! Good beer selection as well."}
{"text":"It was my family's first time going to the Mellow Mushroom. We walked in, were greeted and then seated. Everything was going fine until the time another customer sat on the patio outside our booth by the window. Our food had just arrived and I was disgusted to see said customer spitting countless times on the floor. As I was trying to eat, this was completely unappetizing - I sought the manager. The manager did not look like one at all but rather an 18 year old girl with no sense of her job. I told her that I was disgusted and that as a first time customer it's a huge deterrent. She did not do anything about it other than claiming she would have someone sent out to talk to the customer. After someone said something to the customer he, rather than being removed from the property, moved inside to the bar and sat with his friends. There was no compensation on the bill what-so-ever for my unpleasant experience - and I asked them to get me a box immediately cause I didn't want to finish my food! I wanted to leave! No one apologized for the customer's behavior. Completely disgraceful of a restaurant and a manager to do nothing. It is by doing nothing that they've lost my business."}
{"text":"Went tonight for their Grand Opening! The food was very good! Service was exceptional!  Great location with lots of seating."}
{"text":"Pizza & salad were awesome - very tasty.  I'm all for fun, music themed decor- but for me, it was too much.  On the verge of tacky.  Delicious food and helpful service."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and a salad, both were quite tasty. There was one issue however, they did not cut my pizza which made it very difficult to eat. Otherwise a totally good experience."}
{"text":"Don't let the Hard Rock Cafe-style t-shirt shop at the front entrance scare you away from a solid pizza and beer joint.

I had been to another Mellow Mushroom in Columbia, S.C., so I was expecting dark, cramped and a little grimy. You know, like a real college town. This one is bright, loud and wide open.

So the Tempe location couldn't shake the corporate vibe of the what-the-heck-is-this-doing-in-a-college-town Z Gallerie it replaced. And it's not gonna stop longtime Tempe townies from whining about the good ol' days of Long Wong's.

But Mellow Mushroom is a simple concept - pizza and beer. And they pretty well crush it.

First up is the beer list. They have more than 40 beers on tap, including smaller local players like SunUp and Lumberyard as well as rarities like Bell's Oberon. Most of them go for $6 a pint or $7 for a 20-ounce glass. Not the worst prices in town, but they're gonna need some drink specials to keep the ASU crowd hanging out.

The pizza lineup is equally impressive. My wife has a severe tomato intolerance, which takes a lot of the fun out of pizza night. I get awful tired of eating everybody's \"bianca\" or \"blanca\" - the ubiquitous specialty pizza that subs garlic sauce and puts a few dabs of ricotta on top. Props to Mellow Mushroom for offering a whopping seven specialty pizzas sans tomato sauce and two non-tomato sauce options for custom pies.

We got the Red Skin Potato Pie, which also had bacon, onion, chives and a ranch drizzle. I'd worry about a pizza like that being too starchy, but the thin-sliced potatoes worked in perfect harmony with the other toppings.

We also got the pretzels, which are giant knots of MM's pizza dough (these guys like to brag about the dough). Troy S. might have had different expectations, but we thoroughly enjoyed the soft, hot, doughy concoctions.

Our waitress seemed like she was having fun as she introduced herself as our guide to a \"magical mystery tour of flavor,\" and the restaurant's sprawling, open floorplan seemed like it would work well for large groups.

Bonus: They validate your parking for the Centerpointe garage, which will save you six bucks.

So here's a recap: Pizza + beer = awesome. Clever pizza + eclectic beers = even awesomer. Mellow Mushroom is solid execution on this brilliantly simple concept. I'm not going to buy a t-shirt or proclaim this place the savior of Mill Avenue, but this college-town staple is a welcome addition that's worth the trip to downtown Tempe."}
{"text":"We went here today for a nice date night. The first time I was here, it took my cousin and I 45 minutes to get a small pizza. I can understand if it's busy, but there were maybe 5 other people in the building divided between 2 groups. I didn't even get the pizza until I asked someone about it and then he checked to find it conveniently ready at that point. SURPRISE, it was cold! That was the first visit. Today, like I said earlier, my wife and I decided to give them a second chance. We got our names in and sat down. A minute later, the hostess told us we needed to throw away our water bottles. It's 110 out! My wife asked if we could keep them in her purse while we were here so they don't get hot in the car or wasted in the trash seeing as they were brand new. They said no, so we asked for the manager (Mark) who tried to force feed us some BS about Maricopa county setting that rule. Now, I work in the food industry and we don't allow outside food or beverage either, but if someone walks in with a bottle of water, we allow them to have it. We have had many many health inspections, with this occurring, and never once failed or got dinged for it! We told the Mark about our first visit and how we would never be back again and wouldn't even continue with this time except that we had a groupon as a gift. We left for a second to cool off and and came back a few minutes later and our wait went from 15 minutes to 25 minutes! The manager knew we were back and mumbled under his breath that our service would be better this time. We took our table once we were called and the waitress took our order. The food came out in a decent amount of time, actually. Before the food was delivered, my water was already empty. Not once were we checked on by the waitress or Mark. I'm actually surprised Mark didn't check on us, knowing we were upset. Point is, no one checked on us. Also, my drink remained empty for the duration of our visit. Here's something funny, they gave us such grief over a water bottle because \"they don't know where it was processed\" and \"Maricopa county tells us to not allow it.\" Do you think they would say something to the family feeding their kids cereal from home two tables over from us? NOPE, not a word to them! Do NOT go here! Try another mellow mushroom if you must, but so far we are 2 for 2 with horrible experiences at this location. All my wife and I know is mellow mushroom as a company has struck out with us."}
{"text":"I saw the chicken mole pizza on their website and was dying to try something so unique and bold. I called to order my pizza and gave my name and number and was told it would take about 20 minutes. When I arrived at the take out window, I had to wait about 5 minutes while the 3 cooks stood around until they could flag someone down to help me. When she arrived, she told me that they no longer made the mole pizza and tried to call but wasn't sure she had the right number...but I could choose another pizza to purchase and wait 20 minutes for. It wasn't busy inside and I can see why...Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"MM was my go to place due to wonderful employees. After being hacked on my Groupon account while on MM Wi-Fi I was concerned. So, I decided to ask management about the breach. I also wanted to know what to do regarding the hack via Groupon. I just wanted to know what I should do if I find out it was one of their employees.i was told it's not one of our people. Then I was told to leave and not come back. I frequented MM almost on a daily basis. Being new to Phoenix I was just trying to be part of the community. I wish their management would have handled it in a more professional manner. I'll miss all the good people at MM.

Let me also say I forgive the manager for her misguided decision to kick me out. I'm all about love, not hate. I truly hope my Yelp doesn't impact your job in a negative way."}
{"text":"Update: the owner contacted us and was amazing! He was remorseful / apologetic. He resolved all of our concerns. Great ownership!!! 

_________________________________

We've been to other Mellows before and frequent the Tempe location very often. We went to this specific location (12/18/15) for a birthday party the was taking place at Wild Horse. Wanting to get out of the casino atmosphere for a spell, some of us Uber'd it to this Mellow. Our waitress was good. Food was good. This was where the praise stops. The bar manager is clueless and can't run a lemonade stand at a garage sale. His happy hr menus was riddle with false advertising. It was happy hour so we steered clear of the 5 clearly marked no happy hour beers. We orders SEVEN beers (not designated no hh on the menu) only to have our poor waitress come back each time stating it wasn't hh eligible. Finally the incompetent bar manager came out to us blaming the poor waitress for not knowing what beers were hh exempt. We quickly dismissed this- then them manager said it was b/c the no hh wouldn't fit on the menu. What?! I know this is the same ownership as other valley MM why is this one ran so poorly? We were very frustrated so we told our other friends that were going to join us to stay at the casino and we quickly Uber'd it out of there. This MM needs help! Maybe Keith from Tempe needs to go fix them, something need to be done. We'll never return to this location and pray that the new Mellow going up isn't ran this poorly. False advertising and deferring blame is unacceptable! This bar manager needs help and training!!"}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour where all appetizers and drinks are half off. The bartenders are great especially Nate. He always goes above and beyond. I love this place, must check it out."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Mellow Mushroom, our first was several years ago and we were not impressed. We thought we would give this new location a try. Once again we did not enjoy our visit. Way too expensive for the quality of the food compared to other pizza restaurants. The Greek salad is iceburg lettuce only with kalamata olives a bit of cheese, etc. Pretzel bites are just pizza dough with Parmesan sprinkle, that does not make it a pretzel. We order a pepperoni pizza and the meat just tasted like Hormel pepperoni that you buy at the grocery store. My husband had a sausage sandwich and he said it just did not have much flavor. Additionally the service was pretty slow, I guess they fully embrace the Mellow of their name. Needless to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I went here on date night with my husband and was thoroughly disappointed. We wanted to give this place a shot, but it failed on all levels of our expectations. The food lacked real flavor, and was way over priced for the quality. I could get better pizza at the local chain pizza joint down the street. There were two good things about this place: good local draft beer, and friendly servers."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have only been here once.  I will be absolutely returning.  It's in a GREAT location, funky inside..love the retro look painting over the big booth, the lights over the bar are cool, overall my type of decor. The pizza was AWESOME, staff was friendly and yes I certainly will return, good time all around xo"}
{"text":"The service was top 3 worst I have ever experienced! 

This was clearly our servers first gig in the restaurant biz. She was clueless on the menu and not very attentive to our table and order( she spent her time chatting up the table full of guys next to us). We had to remind her several times to check on drinks and food. Even for a new restaurant, her level of incompetence was unacceptable. 

Our family walked in at 715 and walked out at 930.  We only waited about 15 mins for our table, so our dinner took every bit of two hours. With two small kids this was not a fun time. 

On a positive note...the food was tasty and the beer selection was excellent. Once management works out the kinks and gets rid of the bad apples, this will be a pretty good pizza joint.  If the service wasn't god awful, this might be a 4 star review."}
{"text":"Alright. So the space was a lot bigger and cuter than expected. All kinds of cool wall decor that's colorful. The wait wasn't too bad. We ordered the house special pizza and it was pretty good. It wasn't super amazing but it was fresh and tasty. We did try the spinach dip which was very hot and fresh. The pizza though was super expensive. $25 for the large!!!! Even more than (super good) Angelo's and as far as I know this place doesn't have any special discount nights. I was disappointed in the price of the beers. Especially the bottles. $5.50 for a bottle of bumbleberry???!!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out last week to get some dessert, and was utterly mind-blown by the thrilling reality that is Mellow Mushroom. I walked in and immediately asked my friend, \"Are we in the right place? This looks like some kind of theater\". All of a sudden a young lass by the name of Leah approached us and welcomed us. It was at that moment I knew I was in the dopest pizza place around. My server was really chill, but for the life of me I can't remember his name. He noticed some cuts on my hand I had acquired earlier in the day and asked me what I had done. I informed him that it was a longboarding disaster, and he proceeded to inform me of a series of tips and tidbits to help prevent myself from falling next time. Anyway, Leah was nice enough to give me a tour of the second floor even though it was closed, and whoa, it was bodacious. There were so many intriguing decorations scattered about the invigorating environment. I got the half baked brownie supreme and it was totally rad. So I'm going to give the Mellow Mushroom 4 stars today. And if any of the big dogs in the front office are reading this, I would totally recommend promoting Leah and giving that other guy a raise."}
{"text":"I love their pizza.  Have not had a bad experience or bad food there the 3 times I've eaten there over the past couple of months."}
{"text":"Horrible management, unorganized, and lack communication.
Never will I use them as a cater again."}
{"text":"If you are into craft brews, this is your place.  Hence the 5 stars.  Places in the Phoenix area have too much water (Bud, Bud light, Coors).  When I hear a server list those beers after asking what they serve, I just cringe.  Not a problem here, with 50 beers on tap.  Half off at happy hour too!"}
{"text":"We went to mellow mushroom after a concert. We have been there many times. We asked for Apple martinis and the bartender said he \"wasn't comfortable serving us\". We hadn't had anything to drink. His manager came over and I asked why we weren't able to be served and he gave me an attitude saying \"nope they can't have anything\". After we had already ordered food. It's crazy to me that we were unable to be served and order food even though we hadn't had anything else to drink. They lost my service. I'm a bartender and I know how the business works. That was embarrassing and unprofessional."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I will definitely go again. The gluten-free crust is great! Much better than at several other pizza places in the valley (I am looking at you Picazzo's). Other than that, it's just a chill upscale pizza place with a talkative and enthusiastic owner. For 1 small and 1 medium pizza plus two drinks, the total was just under $40."}
{"text":"Great times here! My wife and I love the happy hour, I ordered a Makers Mark double and it was half off! Insane how good the meatballs are, I really don't care for a fatty type of pizza but hey the taste is awesome. Service was relaxed just as the name is, been here more than a few times and I feel they deserve 5 stars with Mellow Mushrooms consistency with food and service. Just FYI they do not have a host past business hours but they will greet you in a fashionable time. Also the place gets packed due to the amazing specials so have common sense in knowing that there might be a wait to get seated. Besides that I think I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"My cook must have been on magic mushrooms.. i ordered shitake mushroom calzone and they were all regular old mushrooms.

somewhat overpriced also.. $16 for just a calzone.

probably wont go back."}
{"text":"Who knew such a cool place existed on Mill? I went here for a Sunday lunch with a friend after hearing decent reviews from another firend who had gone here for happy hour and apps. Their menu and review boosted of the best pizza in Arizona so I was intrigued. We ordered a half buffalo chicken half BBQ chicken medium pizza for the two of us and it was fantastic.

Huge pieces, so a medium was more than enough. The crust was like nothing I've had before as it was made of like a wheat dough, drizzled with a garlic sauce perhaps. The chicken was done well on both halves and neither were swimming in the sauce. I'm not a carmelized onion fan but they were on the BBQ chicken side and I actually enjoyed them. Not slimy or overwhleming, but pretty complimentary of the sauce. 

The atmosphere was pretty cool too. I didn't understand the idea behind the mushroom thing and was a bit turned off because I'm grossed out by fungi, but they pulled it off in a cool, funky, non-fungi type of way. The waitress was super sweet too and let us know all about their awesome pizzas. I would totally go back here."}
{"text":"First Review! Yayy!

So, I love a good Mellow Mushroom. This is the third location I've been to in Charlotte, and they just opened this uptown location on Monday, I learned. Just like the others in Charlotte, it's fancy schmancy. I can foresee this location being particularly busy, especially during basball and football seasons as it is right between both stadiums and across from the \"French Quarter\".

I was surprised that they weren't busier, but the server/bartender we had told us that this was still considered their \"soft opening\" week, and there hadn't been much advertising yet. Come Sunday, when the Panthers take on the NO Saints at home, they'll get more business than they are ready for...

Anyhow the more important piece of this review- the drink, food, and service:
Well, they've got quite a solid selection of taps, but half of the tap line was down due to issues with the refrigeration sysytem, so no OH Death By Hops for me. (Waah) It's okay though- I went with a  Bell's 3rd Coast Barleywine instead. YUM. You don't see this beer around much in these parts. Fair warning, if you order a beer that is over 7.0% ABV (Bell's Two Hearted) be prepared for a smaller pour. I can understand this notion for the 10% beer I was drinking, but for the Foothills Jade IPA (only 7.4%) I drank later, I think a small pour is silly, in my humble beer drinking opinion.

The food was just alright on this visit. The bruschetta was lacking in flavor, and the toppings seemed a little scant. I did however like the way they toasted the bread, it was the perfect balance of crunchy and soft. The pizza was alright, but not as amazing as other Mellow Mushroom pizza i'd had before. My friend could not decide which kind she wanted, so we went halfsies and got the Holy Shiitake and Redskin combo. Didn't seem like as many toppings as I'm used to seeing on a Mellow pie, and again, the flavors were lacking.

Service was great. We sat at the bar, and were greeted immediately by a friendly Ray and a friendly Taylor. Both were very accomodating, and offered samples to my not-so-beer-savvy comrade. They get two thumbs up. 

If Yelp offered the half star rating, i'd go 3.5/5. There's room for improvement, but understanding its only the first week of business, I'll come back once they get settled. They're open til 4 am on the weekends, which is crucial after the clubs and bars all close and there's nowhere else to go when you're drunk hungry."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom sticks out in the Myer's Park neighborhood for all the right reasons- laid back atmosphere with pleasant service, a casual family-friendly environment with colorful decor, and it's deliciously scrumptious pizza. 

When entering the restaraunt, I immediately notice the vibrantly colored murals, the bright bubbling lava lamps over the bar, and the many flat screen tv's that line the walls (there's even tv's on the patio!). If you enjoy a relaxed environment where you can catch the game, race, or even the news while enjoying a beer, this is the place for you. With ample seating,  this  Mushroom offers quite a spacious environment. I noticed several large groups sitting toward the back of the restaraunt (under the festival murals), which told me they are capable of catering to birthday parties, and social gatherings. If you have children that are easily fascinated, the \"magic bus\" will be your first choice seating arrangement- and you can't miss it! It's a REAL schoolbus that was painted and overhauled to fit tables. Be forewarned, they do NOT offer reservations, but the hostess took our names, gave us a buzzer and we were seated in 20 minutes(Granted, we went on a weekend night). Despite having to wait, the staff we encountered were very pleasant, and seemed to enjoy doing their job!

Now- the best part- the food and drink:

The menu offered several choices of appetizers (pretzels, spinach dip, hummus, caprisse, wings, etc). We chose to try the spinach dip, which came to our table bubbling hot from the oven, served with crispy garlic toast points. It was gooey, cheesy, and nothing short of incredible, most importantly- the spinach and chunks of artichoke were fresh, along with the layer of shaved parmesean that came on top. Sooo good. 

While we pondered the rest of the menu, I embarked on the beer list. If you like good, high quality beers and microbrews, the beer list is a gem. The drink specials they offer are quite reasonable, considering most of the beer IS craft brew. Tonight they were offering Abita pints (their featured brewery of the month) for $3.50 and $11 pitchers. Knowing our own thirsts, we settled on a pitcher, which went quite swimmingly with our meal.

If you like a thin, greasy, foldable triangle slice, this ain't NY. The crust is hand tossed, the toppings are all fresh, and the pizza is baked to order. That being said, you'll wait a humble conversation or music-filled 30 mnutes for a pizza if it's very busy. Understandable, because this isn't Domino's or Little Caesar's- I saw at least five people tossing dough in the kitchen, and two others pulling pizzas out of the oven. That tells me enough. And the wait was well worth it! The crust was a nice brown (but it's NOT a wheat crust, i was told). They brush their yummy crust in garlic butter and parmesean cheese, which can only be good! The cheese was practically dripping off each slice, and the toppings were a-plenty. We got the philosopher's pie- complete with artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, feta, provolone, mozz, and steak. It was every bit of delicious that our server promised us it would be

The best thing a pizza place can offer is variety and options. They offer a gluten free crust and a list of gluten free ingredients, and if you prefer, vegan cheese. If you want to modify or build your own pie from the ground up, you can do it here. They will accomidate it all!

Based on this experience, I'm definitely coming back. Next time, for lunch. Though it's not advertised on the menu- this particular mellow has lunch specials (a mere $5.95 for two slices+drink or a slice+salad+drink, if you prefer!!). If ya haven't jumped on the bus yet man, you better hurry up!"}
{"text":"Three stars for the food and price and a bonus star for service. The pretzel bites with cheese was the star of the night. The veggie calzone was good, bbq wings ok, cinnamon pretzel and the brownie sundae were worth over eating for. 

Lastly our server Steve was great. He was attentive but not in our way, friendly and gave great beer recommendations."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is the best bar on mill if you want to avoid the crazy college scene. They have huge and excellent tap list for beer and their happy hour is second to none (half off all alcohol!)."}
{"text":"Went here at around 11pm on a Thursday night because me and my friends were feeling some \"munchies\" food. We were guided to sit in the bar because it was around 10:50pm and that was the only place they were seating people at the time. We sat there for about 20 minutes and received no service from the bartender Matt. When we got up to leave he said we had to come up to the bar to order because it was \"bar-service\" only. I have eaten here many times and every time the bartender came to the table to take the order. The bartender was extremely rude and I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fun fun fun place! Very laid back and a great place all around. You can bring your family, a date, or just hang out with friends. Went on a Tuesday and they had a fun trivia night! Huge draft beer selection and the pizza is amazing! Loved the Kosmic Karma!"}
{"text":"Charging $27 for a large 2 topping pizza seems a bit extreme to start, but what the heck, you only live once. This is one time I wish I had more than one life. One to get back from that horrible pizza.  
Even with a $10 Groupon discount this pizza still wasn't worth the price. 
The crust was burnt and bitter. The sauce was bland and the overall experience was one of major disappointment. 
If we had eaten in the place we could have said something, but we took the pizza home to eat. 
Looks like I'll be staying with Johnnies, Pizza Hut and Dominoes for now."}
{"text":"Some great pizza and beer at this spot! We have been coming here for years and it never disappoints. Great happy hour as well. Their pizza is delicious, but don't forget about the soft pretzels & marinara, make sure to order their friend beer cheese to accompany them....yum. You won't want to miss out on those bad boys...."}
{"text":"I love this pizza, especially the crust.  I always order the Mega Veggie with Daiya cheese (always specifying that the whole pizza be vegan). This pizza never disappoints!
I've got my work started on ordering from here on Saturdays. Now the whole group of us order the calzones, salads and pizzas for a filling, delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Food is not bad. Every server seems to have a facial or nasal piercing. Not appetizing."}
{"text":"From the name I would expect them to be expert at pizza. Not so. Our  mushroom pie came with a ring of mayonnaise that tasted plain ugly and impossible to scrape off. Both of us had tummy troubles all night! The salads, however, were cold & crisp and tasty. Unfortunately the dressing was way too thick to think that it could have been touched by human hands at all in the making of it."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and service. A must place to eat if you're on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"Pizza was decent, but the carry out service is pretty bad. Twice we have ordered the pizza to pick up, were told it would be 45 minutes, then when we got there had to wait a long time. The first time my husband was literally told \"I have no idea when it will be ready\", very off the cuff. Then he waited 30 minutes. Against better judgement, we tried again because thought it was just new.  We tried again and again it took 30 minites after we got there. Just tell me how long it's really going to be!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch ! Mushroom soup, mushroom hoagie and shiitake pie was a delight ! Dylan was our server and was so sweet !"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, incredible service, and great beer selection. 

Drove up to Mill Avenue from Tucson, AZ to meet some friends from out of town who were leaving from the nearby airport. By the time everyone managed to get to the area pretty much everywhere else was closed (it was a Sunday night). Another restaurant who had just closed their kitchen recommended them.

Comfortable relaxed atmosphere. Speedy service. When the food came it was amazing. We had a big group with 4 different options to share and everything was spectacular. My favorite was the spinach artichoke dip. Price was not expensive at all for quality of food. If you are looking to pay $5 for a Little Ceaser's style pizza this is not your bar/restaurant, but if you want great food for a fair price then give this place a try.

Watched the wait staff and manager not only provide excellent service to us all night but go above and beyond for two separate nearby patrons throughout the evening. I will be visiting every time I am in the area and recommending it to friends."}
{"text":"Always great food and service! Sometimes the bar area could use a little more help with wait staff but they try their hardest!! I have noticed on busy nights there is only one wait staff in the bar which is not enough for that area."}
{"text":"They made me wait 45 mins for garlic bread for take out when they weren't busy because they forgot about me. And it wasn't even good their chicken Cesar salad was awful too. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't have high expectations for this place coming in. I have eaten at a mellow mushroom before years ago and didn't think much of it then. Wow was I wrong! The house special pizza was delicious. Just a pile or goodness on top and the crust was yummy and crispy!! BF got the Jamaican jerk chicken hoagie and he loved that as well. Key lime pie was also delicious!! Can't wait to go back again and try more pizzas."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a neighborhood place to eat or hang out with friends and family this is the place. They have two of the best servers around; understand these two are super busy but do their best to make your visit fun and satisfying. Ask for Max or Amber they are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Good lunch specials, nice ambiance.  The pizza has great sauce and toppings.  Enjoy this laid back place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Two stars because I couldn't quite give it three...  We tried this place because we had a coupon and we heard that they had vegetarian options.

The service was slow and inattentive.  We were seated in a place that seemed to be tucked away almost like they didn't want to have to look at us.  That's alright, but the waiter should have checked in on us a little more instead of just taking it for granted that we would tip him.  Or, maybe he was frightened of us?  

Food was slow in getting to us, but not so slow that I would have walked out.  The music was too loud, it was distracting and made it seem like the wait was longer.  We got to stare at the pretentious decor for a little too long.  But, we figured if the food is good, it doesn't matter too much.  

We had gluten free pizzas with vegan cheese.  It was okay...they skimped on the vegan cheese horribly.  But, the pizza was hot when we got it so I guess that was a plus.  I was expecting it to be cold because the server seemed to avoid us...or maybe this was because it was so loud and he knew he couldn't hear us or it was hurting his hearing at the spot where we were?  Who knows.

The pizzas were not large enough.  We ordered two so we could take pizza back to another family member.  Both of us made an effort to stop eating so there would be enough to take with us. 

The WORST part of it was discovering how much the bill was at the end.  This was a very expensive place to eat.  The prices were not clearly marked on the menu for the gluten-free things or I would probably have walked out in the beginning.  We were charged $3 extra for vegan cheese...but as I said they put so little on the pizzas.  So, the little pizzas we ordered ended up being $22 each, the drinks were $6 each, we got an appetizer and we had a $10 off coupon.  For two people to eat a pizza dinner it was $57 AFTER the coupon.  

It wasn't worth it.  I won't go back.  There's other places to eat.  I don't know if this place thinks it is trendy and that makes it worth it?  I was looking forward to eating there because I heard about it from a few people that went to the other location in Phoenix.  The ambiance didn't make up for any of it.

Anyhow...work on your pricing, work on your service and train your servers to be more attentive, and maybe turn down your music so people can enjoy themselves instead of feeling tortured.  Or maybe this is so people don't linger too long?  But then again if that were it, the food would have come faster?

The place wasn't all that busy for a Saturday night at 7:30, but finding a place to park was difficult.  

Mellow Mushroom needs to work on things a bit.  :)  I know that gluten free, vegan fare is somehow more expensive....but this was a little ridiculous."}
{"text":"Great beer selection.  But $5 for 12 oz cans/bottles, $6 for 16 oz drafts and $7 for 20 oz drafts seems a dollar too pricey across the board.

House wine was only $5 a glass.

We had a 10\" house pizza.  Toppings were great, but I didn't care for the crust.  I'm not a traditionalist, mind you...I like corn meal in the crust.  But I didn't care for this crust for some reason.  The toppings, however, were really good.  $12.50 was, again, a little overpriced in my book.

Also had a 1/2 sandwich and salad, $5.50 each.  Good portions on both for that price.

Service was solid.  Very helpful and friendly.  When the wrong beer was brought out, no issue with bringing out the correct beer promptly and apologetically.

I may come back at Happy Hour, as it seems like the prices would be a little more reasonable then.  I probably won't have the pizza again, but it looks like there are lots of other solid options on the menu."}
{"text":"Honestly a terrible experience from the get go. I bet they would have more customers if they didnt treat them like we are idiots and forget everything. We had a five top and the server rarely came to the table, always seemed like he was in a hurry, forgot someones entire dinner plate, forgot ranch and drinks a couple of times, and the pizza that ended up coming out was burnt. Then to top it off they didnt offer any compensation for our horrible experience and the forgotten pizza. I am absolutely not going back again. Hope they improve though cuz they have a nice bar."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!!!! We had half Melloteranian and house special and it was to die for! So flavorful and I never ever would have guessed it's wheat pizza crust. They also have gluten free options that I'll be trying next time along with some beer- a crazy long list! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We won a gift card to this place and had never heard of it. Then we were 
Icky enough to find a Groupon as well! So we decided to head out and check it out and leave the kids with grandma. We went at lunch time and the place was pretty empty.  We were seated in a comfy booth and began looking over the menu. The place had a really nice bar with a lot of interesting beer selections, but we weren't drinking on this particular day, so we passed. We decided to get some appetizers since they were half off for happy hour. I got the Capri (tomatoes, basil, mozzarella and balsamic glaze) and it was wonderful! My husband got the pretzels, which were also really good. We got one of each and liked the Parmesan ones best.

 For entrees we ordered the Holy Shiitake pizza with like 3 kinds of different mushrooms and a Mushroom Club. Both were amazing! The pizza crust is made with molasses and has a really original taste to it. It has some chew to it and a nice crisp exterior. The pizza was decent in size and the price runs about the same as California Pizza Kitchen or most other gourmet pizza places. The pizza was VERY good though. The Club was also really good! It had a lot of meat and the combination of all the ingredients was perfect. Nothing was overpowering and the bread was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. 

Our overall experience was really good! We are looking forward to going back to this place, though we will probably go to the Tempe location as it is closer to our house. Mellow Mushroom is a great place for a unique twist on pizza and the prices are pretty reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I wouldn't not recommend anyone to go here,me and my friend were drinking last night outside patio and this   Waitress won't let us finish our drinks so pushy pushy they want u to finish fast drinking slow down guys manager is a crock to..."}
{"text":"Came in just to look around and grab a drink and ended up finding something on the menu we've been looking for. After looking through the menu we asked about one of the dressings that sounded very unique and a manager brought us a sample. So similar to a dressing we'd had at the Eiffel Tower restaurant in Vegas we had to order a salad with it. Amazing food, awesome service, great atmosphere. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza, consistently horrible waitresses. If you decide to try it out, order it to go! We have eaten in a few times at different locations and the wait staff is always awful. We only get delivery or take out these days."}
{"text":"Love the Shroom! The Mellow Mushroom (TMM) has 47 Draft beers on tap. I started w/ the Rubicon Monkey Knife Fight Pale Ale (5.4% ABV, a mild 27 IBU). Due to location, this one has an elongated layout, which is a bit weird, but breaks up the noise and offers a bit more privacy. Also, par for the course in this locale. 

I'm Lactose Intolerant, one of the reasons I like TMM - their pizzas are still delicious w/o cheese :~)  Got the Maui Wowie Pizza, no cheese, extra pesto/olive oil. Solid!  It's a twist on the traditional Hawaiian Pizza, of which I'm a fan. The crust was just right - well cooked yet a bit chewy - & the applewood smoked bacon and banana peppers were star attractions!"}
{"text":"As always a diverse beer selection and some great pies to choose from. I think tonight they may have been short staffed because they were on a 30 minute wait and had several open tables that were not sat for awhile who knows good pie and beer!!"}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite. The holy shiitake pizza is amazing and the IPA selection is terrific. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The pizza is alright but the time it takes to get your pizza borders on ridiculous.  I have been twice.  The first time was just after this place opened so I thought I would try them again... just as slow now as they were then.  With so many other pizza choices in the Valley, I'd suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just visited mellow mushroom on high st today- this is a fresh review. ...I really wanted to like this place so close to home, but the value was not there! ! PRO's: the menu is quite extensive and they have a lot of unique items to offer.great beer selections, especially on tap... good wait staff. we ordered the meatball  &  steak hoagies. They were tasty despite very little contents. I also had a hard time accepting the $8 charge for the Cesar salad which was very chintzy, portion size almost equivalent to side salad. Cons: they seem to cut corners with small portions... the hoagie French bread was fresh and soft but over bare the inside contents because there wasn't enough. ... also the restaurants music was turned up so loud our waiter had a hard time taking our order.  Sadly, I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm familiar with the chain from North Carolina. I liked it better out there...very doughy crust if you like that. Salads are fairly unique, and good beer selections on tap. A bit out of the way, but a great space for big parties if you happen to live close. If not, I wouldn't make the trek."}
{"text":"Super loud. Salads are a sad story. Good choice of craft beers. Pizza is good. Lots of family's eating here"}
{"text":"I have little to no complaints about this restaurant. My family goes there for most major celebrations they always take such good care of us, whether we are 2 or 20. The food is wonderful and if you can go during their happy hour it's exceptionally worth it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come to Mellow Mushroom as it was a place I frequented when I lived in Atlanta.  Needless to say, it is close but not the same as the ATL.  We tried this location on two separate occasions.  My favorite item is the parmesan pretzels, but they are way to greasy here.  The food is a little pricey for what you get.  Also, the last time we were here, at the end of dinner, I sucked up a dirty straw wrapper in my water.  Needless to say, I won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"A pretty good Mellow Mushroom, though the service was a little odd. The waitress seemed like she didn't really have a handle on the menu, and reacted with suspicion when we asked for Coke Zero (clearly listed on the menu) before coming back and saying that it wasn't available. The food was good, and they kept one of our pizzas separate from the others (it had gluten free ingredients) but I've been to better Mellow Mushrooms."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza joint. Love the sandwiches and pizzas and the bar. The restaurant area closes earlier than the bar so you can seat yourself at the bar until they close. Love their buffalo chicken/bacon pizza."}
{"text":"Ate here today and the food was good, but the atmosphere was kind of disturbing/disappointing. It was not busy at all for lunch time hours, it was us and maybe one other group of people. The hostess was not very welcoming or personable. The waiter was decent but his appearance was not very well put together. The most disturbing part was the music that was being played. It was as if someone had their own personal playlist going over the loud speakers. Worst of all was the rap music; don't get me wrong I listen to rap music all the time but I don't want to go into a restaurant and hear songs that talk about strippers, hoes, sh*t, nig*as and bit*hes. Totally inappropriate and unacceptable and it was kind of uncomfortable. Was there no one in a management type position to regulate that?"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurants! Not every day you can dairy free pizza! We frequent mellow often to get pizza with the dayaa cheese and ciders! Has gluten free options too!"}
{"text":"We would good often, there Happy hour is one of the best in Desert Ridge but all good things come to an end...They are starting to get the wrong crowd for City North. I stopped by there yesterday to have drinks with a friend around 3pm and mind you this is a restaurant and children are always in there. I walked into the WOMEN'S bathroom and one of Mellow Mushrooms wait staff was allowing gentleman to use the women's restroom, what if a  young girl would of walked in!! Discussed and will never return..This is not the crowd for City North and as it might seemed to be picking up after the long wait of having no customers, keep allowing this kind of behavior and they will be back to where they started.."}
{"text":"I've spent plenty of time at Mellow over the last few years and things haven't changed. The food, the beers and the service have always been and still remain exemplary!"}
{"text":"We just had the pretzels and a brew.  However, we tried to sit outside on the patio and a chain smoker came out there.  They really should ban these people to an island in the South Pacific.  I didn't get the sense that the pizza was anything to write home about.  I would go again for pretzels and sit inside."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from here for the 1st time and I have to say I will be back.  
We had 2 pizzas, 1 half Red Skin Potato Pie and half Egg & Pancetta.  The other was the Funky Q. Chicken.  

On the half and half pizza I have to say I have never had a pizza with Egg on it and it was by far one of the best pizzas I have had in awhile.  It was so flavorful, I will defiantly be getting it again.  The Red skin potato side was good, it had a bit of a peppered kick I was not expecting but good.  If I had to choice between the 2 sides, it would be the Egg & Pancetta all the way.

The Funky Q chicken was not bad, I one complaint about it would be it seems like the bacon pieces were too big or too thick because it would be cooked on top but then the parts that were under the cheese  where not cooked all the way with chewy fat. They might want to try pre-cooking the bacon a bit.  If I got this one again I would leave the bacon off.

The delivery was right one time, and the driver was polite, very courteous and did not have to call asking for a gate code or where our building was in the apartment complex.  The only odd thing about doing the delivery was calling it in, this was the 1st time I have ever had to give my credit card number before they even took my order."}
{"text":"Our server was awesome- I think her name started with an L- maybe lexter? Or Lester? Not sure. Either way she definitely made up for the host horrible manners.....


He didn't offer me a high chair- nothing. I was carrying my one and a half old son. He also was on his cell phone when I walked out of the restaurant .... It just doesn't look good. I work as a server in Colorado and worked for mellow mushroom in Virginia. I understand being bored or busy... But there's a place and time to be in a bad mood and it's not at work. He said thanks and I hope you have a good day but my whole beginning of the experience sucked. And he didn't bother to tell the server he had sat a table outside- so we sat until I asked if we would be greeted.

Hopefully a manager sees this and addresses it with the host. 

Regardless food was good like always and our server made up for the beginning of the experience."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this time wasn't as good as previous visits here ): We ordered the Kosmic Karma pizza, which was 85% sauce, 10% olives, and 5% crust for us...sigh."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this location to open since I saw the sign on the property. My bud said that this place was very good. I went for the first time and the pizza was very good. The crust was the best part- buttery and airy. I had what I refer to as \"the man pizza\" toppings included pepperoni, ham, ground beef, sausage, etc. The only downside was that I ordered a steak salad on the side and the waitress came back and said they were out of steak. They had only been open for a week. I don't know the first thing about running q restaurant but maybe they should invest in a supply chain guy. Haha"}
{"text":"I went to their new location at Phoenix North on Deer Valley between Tatum and 56th Street. I had the Shittake Pizza which was superb. Highly recommended. Chewy crust with lots of mushrooms. A few negative aspects - the music was way too loud and it was difficult to converse with the wife. Now that I'm thinking, maybe that's a positive feature. We sat on the patio and the misters weren't on so it became quite unpleasant. The manager turned on the mister upon my request. In my opinion, $19 plus tax and gratuity for 6 slices of pizza is on the high side. But, as far as quality of the pizza, it's almost as good as Humble Pie's pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza was really good and I loved their crust. We came in a little after they had opened for the day so servers were standing around waiting for guests to come in and looked very bored. And our server kept trying to upsell and offer us more food every time he came back to check on us, that was quite annoying."}
{"text":"Lunch was really expensive $24 a person Steak sals was ok. Needs different dressing and maybe a smaller version for lunch. The pizza was the worst. We split the lunch size pepperoni and it was burnt and dry and awful. Bummer I was really hoping for a good work day lunch place. This is not it."}
{"text":"Service and management is poor and inconsistant. One minute we were told we could pay .69 cents to add pinnapple to their 8\" pizza special as it was not one of the 8 or so toppings and sub mozzarella for provolone on the hoagie. Five minutes later the waitress returned to say the manager that had originally told her yes to our requests had been yelled at and we needed to place a different order. She explained something about food cost being the reason, but last time I checked mozzarella cheese and pinnapple are not expensive items. And beyond that you do not tell a table one thing and come back 5mins later and say something different. Disappointed in the mellow mushroom today.  ;("}
{"text":"This is probably worst pizza(absolutely no taste) I've had so far, and that's not all. We went there with the kids. This guys idea of kids pizza is a toasted slice of bread with cheese on top. At the table we also had a steak sandwich. Tasted like peppered dog food with nasty cartilage inside. The place doesn't have a fryer, so the side of your sandwich is chips fresh out of a lays bag. Overpriced for the quality, and definitely not worth it. Save your $ and choose something better."}
{"text":"If there is a line, turn around. You can sit at the bar for 45 minutes and order, but the food still came out after we were seated. We had to actually hunt down our original order. Never refilled our drinks, and never cleaned up spills. People waiting watch you eat, which is never fun. A little tightening up of the cleanliness and attentiveness to customer service, and I'd go back based on the beer selection alone. Pizza is salty."}
{"text":"The decor here is open, well-lit, and modern. The staff was friendly and prompt. The restaurant was clean and well-kept. But most importantly, the pizza was delicious. Can't speak for other pizzas on the menu, but I would recommend the House Special from this place.

My only complaint is that the individual ingredients themselves aren't necesarrily stellar. I can see how how a plain cheese pizza, a plain pepperoni pizza, or another kind of such pizza from this place might be underwhelming considering the price. The pizza doesn't really have that magical pop in your mouth that other pizzas might have. That being said, it is a fairly decent pizza with the health benefit of a wheat dough. All in all it was a good time."}
{"text":"Best chain pizza place in the world. Good service good food and good times. Pizza is great and the salads are even better."}
{"text":"good pizza when you finally get it, but Awful service. Ordered a pizza with no bacon, substitute chicken. They made the pizza without the chicken and just threw some on top the pizza and asked if that was ok. Waited 30 mins for a new pizza while everyone else had their food."}
{"text":"Big fans of Mellow Mushroom, and we are so glad to not only have it back in CLT but just up the street in our part of town.

Disclaimer: had they opened in Lake Norman, I am such a big fan of MM I would have been schlepping all the way up there, no questions asked.

I like the decor ... kids thought the indoor bus was fun to check out.  We are going to have to try out the big party tables in the rear sometime.

The food was typical MM ... which in my book is fantastic.  Love their eclectic topping offerings, and that dough is terrific as always.  

My favorite pizza in Charlotte.  (Said by a guy who obviously has too much of an affinity for pizza.)"}
{"text":"BEST pizza I have ever had!! We love going late at night because they still serve pizza and appetizers late night. Also I love their reverse happy hour. The only down side is that late night when we go in the service is a little disappointing. It doesn't look like their are any servers taking tables so the bartenders I guess forget they have to serve tables. We always have to end up going up to the bar to order everything. The only reason we go there is because the food is so good, otherwise we would never go there again."}
{"text":"I've tried this place multiple times.  It's always been subpar.  The only thing good about this place is the selection of craft beer. Today, I came here for lunch.  I was seated at a dirty table/booth that I had to wipe off before sitting. There were multiple flies buzzing around driving people to swat them away from the food and drinks. I ordered a pizza and was given the wrong pizza.  They took it back and made the correct pizza. An hour after ordering the first pizza, I received a second-rate pizza. The server never even apologized though it was his mistake. Never again.  Overall grade = F"}
{"text":"We have been regular customers at this Mellow Mushroom for awhile. Tonight was not their finest moments of service and good reputation. I think this might have been our last trip to this store for awhile. They managed to get 5 out of our 6 orders messed up. This was even after giving server advice that they had mixed the way we asked for wings up before so could she make sure she communicates clearly with the kitchen. Nope.... No Bueno!! On top of that we have 2 black people in our party and music is loudly blaring a racial slur, the N word over and over. As we were leaving I asked the waitress to please explain to the manager how insensitive this was to our guest and she insisted it was ok because the manager from Happy Vally store who picks out night time happy hour music mix is Black so it's ok!!! It certainly was not ok, it was embarrassing for us. We had a Nigerian man with us from L.A. and it was embarrassing!! Disrespectful!!! One young lady with us ordered Vegan Pizza due to dairy allergies and stomach issues. She eats 1 piece and realizes the taste is off that it was not made with Vegan Cheese, manager comes over and gets her the right order but does nothing to even offer to compensate feeding her wrong food. He could have offered a dessert or a soft drink. The Vegan Pizza was a mid-$20 range pizza!! He could have taken 10% off her bill all he would say is \"I replaced the pizza\"!   Really......... She will likely be ill from your mistake pizza tomorrow!"}
{"text":"dude I love mellow!! we come here all the time. the food is always bomb. the servers and staff are awesome. I can't even choose a favorite because they all rock. keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of their Vegan Pizzas. They will definitely cater to your Veg-Needs which is awesome!

I usually get the Mega-Veggie Supreme and I ask for it Vegan. They will not put butter on the crust and put Daiya Cheeses. The pizza is usually super good. 

The other item I get some times is their Vegan Spinach Calzone. I never had a Calzone before, so that was a treat. The only thing is that, 50% of the time, it comes very oily inside. 

The reason I give it 3 stars is the ambiance, wait time, and how loud it can be. I don't think the inside resembles anything like their name \"Mellow Mushroom\". The inside is very standard decor, but the bar area is super loud at night. I usually go at night. I don't think it is that loud in the day time. 

A plus is that they close at 2 AM, so you can get a late meal if you want to. 

The wait time is pretty long since they are making it fresh. If you go, be prepared to wait 25 - 40 minutes for your meal depending on how busy it is. 

Overall, if you love pizza, I recommend this place. I have recommended it to many of my friends. The crust is amazing and VEGAN!"}
{"text":"Heard about this newer pizza joint... Didnt know it was a national chain. So met some friends there. They said wait would be 50 min :-(... but called us after only ten!! Beer/wine selection was decent and atmosphere was a little loud and busy so would not recommend if you want a quiet atmosphere, but pizza was phenomenal. All ingredients were fresh and top notch. Will go back."}
{"text":"My family and I went and waited 3 hours to get our food. Absolutely no joke, we understood it was the first opening week with new employees and new system but 3 HOURS was ridiculous. The food was fairly good but the wait was absurd."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom has a definite funkified feel...just take a gander at the psychedelic 70's bus in the middle of the dining room.  (The kiddos love eating in the bus from what I've seen.) 

While I can't complain about anything, I can't rave either.  The salad was typical salad, the meatballs were typical meatballs...and the pizza, well, it's good, but not the kind of pizza I like to go out for. 

We had the mighty meaty and house special pizza, and it was LOADED with toppings and cheese.  This is one dense, doughy pizza.  If that's you're thing, then go for it.   If you're like me and like a thin, crusty chewy Neapolitan style pie, this ain't gonna cut it. 

Overall, I'd go for pizza and drinks on a casual night, but other than that...find me a good pizza joint where I won't feel greasy and bloated afterward!"}
{"text":"In continuance to my review... It's only now that I was able to sit and check our receipts, which I normally do on a monthly basis.. Upon seeing our mellow mushroom receipt, I tried to see if they deducted the whole $15 of coupons to even out for our long wait, since this was what our server said that the manager did.... Just to find out that they  did not do it at all... All they took out was the $5 coupon given to me when I purchased the Gift cards.... Basically, I believe it's normal for the staff to lie, just to make excuses and just say what you want to hear...   NEVER COMING TO THIS LOCATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the pizza is fantastic - seems to have honey or agave glaze crust with a slight sweetness to balance the crispy crust - Yum!  We had the Thai Dye and Red Skin Potato Pie.  However, the Thai Dye seemed more of a mix between Thai flavors and Indian, with the curry chicken.  Not a big fan of potato pizza, but this was very good.  That said, we had a Caesar salad and chef salad to start.  Both tasted \"homemade\" - not in a good way - and we literally had 2 croutons on the large Caesar.  However, the service was atrocious.  We had to flag down our waitress to refill our drinks (we only wanted one refill - not asking for constant service) and again to get a box for leftovers (which she just placed on the table and then walked away).  We also had to ask (again) for the check and she replied \"Do you have a Groupon\" - ah, the light bulb.  Not sure why she thought we had a Groupon, but should that matter?  Being a former server, I tend to tip more, but definitely not last night.  The waitress was not busy, just decided we were not worth her effort, I suppose.    
Atmosphere - the restaurant was very loud - acoustics are poor.  And, my personal favorite - the party sitting next to us had a Yorkie in the 4th chair.  The dog behaved better than the women sitting with her - they kept fussing over the dog, who just wanted to sleep. But, since the Yorkie was wearing a dress and sitting in a Juicy knockoff bag, hard to believe it was a service animal.  I like dogs, but really not appropriate in a restaurant dining room and seems like the dog should have been discreetly out of sight, not sitting in a chair pulled up right next its owner.
So we might get carryout from now on - pizza only - but unlikely."}
{"text":"This review is based on a take out order. Having had pizza from their other two locations here in Charlotte I was happy to see they opened one in Uptown. Take out order was promptly ready and promised and take out service was quick. Pizza was average and think that if you can, eat in, because the crust is a lot better when it is hot out of the oven fresh. Pizza is pricey, but worth it."}
{"text":"I've been back twice in the past two nights and the experience has been better. I've sat at the bar both nights. The bartenders are great. The atmosphere around the bar is relaxed, the music is good, and there are plenty of TV's. From 3-6PM is their Happy Hour which is 1/2 off drinks and munchies (appetizers) and from 10PM-2AM it's 1/2 off drinks and $3 cheese and pepperoni pizza slices. Can't beat it! I've been by the past two nights to grab a pint and a slice and haven't been disappointed.

Great beer, great food, and a great location."}
{"text":"Hosted a birthday party for 25 13-year-olds, yes you read that right, 25 of them...the servers and service couldn't have been better! They accomdated virtually every request we had and made the party a very special event. 

We ordered using catering and would highly recommend for any party!"}
{"text":"First experience with this place and already impressed. This is how you do customer service. Hostess asked my name for my pick up order and politely asked me to have a seat at the bar while I waited and informed me that the bartender could help me pay. After that, every employee that spoke to me called me by my first name, with genuine smiles, and multiple employees wished me a good day as I left. The pizza is delicious! I'll be back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed is this restaurant seems to be having an identity crisis. From the outside it looks like they went to Universal Studios or MGM and Robed one of the lots. It has the tongue-in-cheek psychedelic references, and then healthy options on the menu. I couldn't determine what demographic they're trying to reach, and I couldn't understand what theme they're trying to portray. The food was okay, a bit pricey for what I got. The bar area is beautiful, and the drinks are very good."}
{"text":"I've never had bad food or bad service at the Happy Valley location.  Everything is usually really good.  Good selection of beers, good happy hour, great food.  
My complaint is just how LOUD IT IS IN THIS RESTAURANT!
My God, have you ever considered installing sound deadeners in the ceiling??  It's almost impossible to hold a conversation, because you have to yell to the person sitting directly across the table.
I don't want to sound like a weenie, but seriously, it's way too loud inside this restaurant.  I saw other people in the restaurant complaining about the same thing.
My ears are still ringing as I write this, no joke."}
{"text":"More than a pizza place its a pretty cool bar too......decent wings on happy hour menu."}
{"text":"The place is nice, the food is ok. The customer service is hands down the worst. We purchased a groupon and they were very  hesitant to accept it. The manager came and told me I had to split my table and create a gap in order to be able to use two groupons (even though the groupon says one per table). The waitress was very rude from the start and the manager was just trying to back her up by what she said. It was very upsetting as a groupon customer to be denied my groupon, which happens to be the reason I came here. As a business owner this is doing the opposite as advertisement it is hurting the business. I would personally like to have higher management contact me about this, this is how upsetting and embarrassing this situation is."}
{"text":"I really wish I was writing a \"Hooray!\" but I'm not. The Uptown location wasn't my first rodeo with the Mushroom and won't be my last.  The Mushroom is usually solid artisan pizza, just not this time.  I started visiting different Mellow Mushrooms about ten years ago.  The Jerk pizza has always been my \"go-to.\"

I went to the Uptown location for a business lunch.  Not too bad.  We got seated in less than a minute.  The menu didn't have my favorite, but I'm the type of person that is willing to try many different things.  So I asked our waitress for a recommendation and was led to the Mellowterranean.  A grilled chicken pizza with onions, roasted red peppers, black olives, chives, feta, mozzarella and tzatziki sauce.  Sounds like a homerun eh?

Two things to note about this pizza:

Gigantic roasted red pepper laid out on the pizza.  This isn't convenient to eat, and the texture and amount just make this strange and unappealing.

Second, yes, the tzatziki is pretty tasty, but I found myself using it to cover up the other tastes.  A condiment should compliment, not be needed to cover up the  the rest of the dish.

Lastly, the cheese bread appetizer.  Oh how I laughed.  The look on my associate's face was priceless.  To quote, \"Is this cheese on hot-dog buns?\"  Lol...I almost spit water out my nose when he said that.  To be fair, what we were brought, looked nothing...and I do mean...nothing...like the picture you see on Yelp.  Maybe they were out of bread and went with the old \"McGuyver that shit\" method...but \"hot-dog buns\" is being nice about it.

So why three stars if the whole experience was less than decent?  Because I know the Mellow Mushroom as a whole.  I know that this is the only experience I've had that was disappointing.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe it was blah blah blah.  Regardless of what it was, I'd go back and expect things to be a much better experience.  Would I recommend or order what I've had?  Not a chance, but I wouldn't exclude them from my list of pizza joints based on one bad experience either."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is a great and successful restaurant/bar as it should be. I was there on a Tuesday night and the best part about the place is definitely the service. The waitresses that helped us were extremely nice and treated us very well, she even gave us a free slice of pizza! The pizza itself is definitely the best local thin crust pizza I've ever had. I'm not normally a fan of thin crust but give me a Mellow Mushroom thin crust over any thick crust any day of the week. The only gripe I have with the pizza is the price, It was about $3.00 for one slice but whole pizzas are cheaper should you be hungrier than me."}
{"text":"Pizza is unique, the pretzels are ridiculously good. The thing I value the most is the staff though, they work together and are all extremely friendly / personable. Aaron is the front of the house manager and he greets everyone with a smile and is extremely  friendly. I love the bar I must admit. Jenna and Till are out of this world, always on top if it when they are busy and chatting it up with their guests. Happy hour is half off almost all alcohol, and the seasonal beers on tap are excellent."}
{"text":"Huge fan of mellow mushroom in the north valley! They always have a great beer selection of local and out of state craft brews. Their menu is a great mix of classic pizza recipes and really unique ones from the restaurant itself. 

I have been to two different mellow locations, one here in Arizona and another in north Carolina, Arizona hands down is way better! Not sure if the other was a franchise or not, but believe me the Arizona location is by far way better!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a pizza and had it delivered to my house. Not only did they charge the wrong amount to my card but they delivered the wrong pizza. When I called to let them know the girl who answered the phone said someone would call me back. Never got a call so I finally called and asked to speak to the manager who did not apologize or seem concerned at all. 

Will not be going back!!!"}
{"text":"After hearing my friends rave about this place, I finally decided to find out what all the fuss was about.  I don't frequent Tempe much these days, so I wasn't exactly sure where this was located; turns out it's in the old Z Gallery building.  A lot has changed in Tempe since I last worked there, including the parking situation, which was never great to begin with, and now it's even worse.  If you hit it on a Sunday, you can avoid paying the meter. Some things are still the same.  Some sketchy looking dude was hanging outside the building asking customers for food or money as they left, and we were followed back out to my car by a not so subtle homeless/crackhead/crazy person, who I was fully prepared to mace.   

The place was relatively empty, but considering how large it is inside, I'm willing to bet that during ASU's semesters that place is hopping.

Our server wasn't overly enthusiastic, but overall she did a decent job.  She did seem annoyed with me while I was attempting to get my niece to order what we had agreed on.  That kid has zero understanding of money/budgeting, and I've really been trying to teach her, so I could've done without that look of judgment from the server.  

My niece got a medium pizza with red sauce and a pesto swirl, artichoke hearts and salami.  I got a gluten free Gourmet White.  When they came out, I was impressed by the size of the medium pizza.  I would probably call that a large.  Gluten free only comes in one size.  Although it could've used more garlic, my pizza was good.  It's probably the best gluten free crust I've had thus far.  My niece's pizza looked and smelled amazing.  I tasted the pesto, and it rocked.  

I was a little surprised by the prices, especially since my consistently broke friends frequent this place so much.  They won't pay more than $35 for a hotel room in Vegas, but will pay $25 for a pizza?  Yeah, I'll probably never get that, but I digress."}
{"text":"I first tried Mellow Mushroom in NC and was glad they opened up in Phoenix. Love their pizzas. Creative, huge and delish! My favorite is the philosopher greek style pizza. Very fine service. Nice fun atmosphere for whole family. Can get crowded on weekends so that tells you about how people enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Although our experience with the kitchen was less than stellar, our bartender John was extremely prompt, friendly and attentive.  When we disclosed our disappointment with our pizzas both John and Matt(kitchen manager) were quick to remedy our situation and make us feel valued and appreciated. 
Many establishments struggle from time to time.  Do these folks a favor and let them know where they can improve because we don't want to lose their taps in the \"tukee\""}
{"text":"\"Time heals all wounds\" appears to have worked as the thought of a return visit to The Mellow Mushroom no longer included an involuntary gag reflex. 

My return visit requires an update:
- GREAT NEWS!!! The beer selection is not bad! 

Unfortunately no indication of any improvement in the food quality. On the plus I realized that their pretzels and cheese sauce is a MUST should anyone wish to experience how Elly Mae Clampett, from the Beverly Hillbillies, would have made them.....just think of Jethro when he broke his toe after dropping one of Elly Mae's donuts on his foot out by the cement pond."}
{"text":"Don't waist your money here! No wait at the door- seated immediately on a Sat. Night at 6:55pm- huge red flag!  After we ordered Very long wait - over an hour - one pizza was room temperature -BAD! one was warm OK- one warmer but NOTHING WE WOULD EVER SPEND MONEY TO GO BACK TO!  
Mngr. Took one pizza off the bill and said sorry about the wait. when we got our bill $50. He gave us 6 coupons for $5 off each time we come back (as if we're going to come back 6x - I won't ever be back!  Note to Mngr.  If you want to prove to people you do excellent food & service & this was a complete mishap- then comp their bill & invite them back on you! Don't charge them over $50 for quality like a freezer box."}
{"text":"All the appetizers are awesome, they have the best pizza and the best calzones. Only downside is their food is expensive, always end up leaving spending at least $65-$70"}
{"text":"Chris Brown (I believe that's what she said her name is) is a huge asset to this restaurant. My girlfriend and I come here rather frequently and have gotten mediocre service from this place on plenty of occasions. However, Chris has always been on top of everything and makes our experience that much better. I have no idea what her job is there because she's always doing everything and doing it well. I'm in the industry as well and I literally made an account just to commend how good of a job she does. I wish my restaurant had someone like her lol.

ANYWAY, The food is always pretty good and good beer selection. It's the best option for late night food and bars. Will def. be back."}
{"text":"Have tried this place twice with mixed results. First time was great - caesar salad and a calzone. Portion sizes are enormous. Second time was carry out. Somehow they could not figure out how to get my salad made, even though the calzones had been ready for over 30 minutes. No server or host was able to help. Kept telling me the manager was working on it. The manager could have made 20 salads in the time she stood over the kitchen folks. They did refund our payment, so we are willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"Pizzas are delish. The dough they use is soft and full of flavor. The pretzel bites are great. Good drinks. Fun place to go out to eat. Our server, Trent, was awesome! They have someone who makes balloon art and kids love that. Great service, great food, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The staff were fantastic! The manager is a wonderful guy who obviously knows how to hire truly lovely waitstaff. The food was delicious and when there was a slight mixup with our order (that we did not even notice) they comped us on the affected item preemptively. Lovely, clean space, great food, prompt and lovely service. I will be going back again and again with my family. :) They were even playing the Copa Americana game last night! Yes!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing! Their mushroom pizza was the best I've ever tasted! I'm addition their beer selection was diverse and unique. The atmosphere is fun and trendy."}
{"text":"Great service!!! Fast and very courteous! Awesome Happy Hour prices! Good food! We had the hummus and spinach artichoke dip,  and sandwiches. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great variety of pizza & beer. Really good crust. Lots of veggie options. Happy hour 3-6p."}
{"text":"Rarely do I get my undies in a bunch over a pizza place, but the food here was amazing. I have never had pizza like this, and I am now a convert. 
Went in on a whim and thought it would be more of a take out place, but it is sit down. We ordered raspberry beers, which were delicious, and had appetizers, the wings, which were baked not friend, and stuffed portobello mushrooms, which were outstanding. Super fresh, lots of cheese, and served with a syruppy balsamic dressing. Outstanding. The wings were good, not great. We had mild buffalo sauce (which was waaaay too mild, I would order medium next time) and the Thai sauce wings, which were the best. They were meaty, which was good. 
The pizza: Heaven sent. They use molasses in their dough, and the dough reminds almost of a soft pretzel. Awesome. I had the friend egg and pancetta pizza, which blew my mind, and my fiance had a pizza with olives, artichoke hearts, and lots of cheese. Both pizzas blew my mind and all the ingredients were super fresh. 
I can see how some reviews don't like the pizza, it is an acquired taste. If you are looking for a traditional pie, don't go there. It is far from traditional. the food was fresh and the service was attentive. Our server was a really nice guy and was super chatty and helpful. 
the only thing I don't get is the decor. Like, city modern meets hippie dippy? It is weird. I have heard that the one in Tempe is very eclectic and hippie, which makes more sense. I am guessing they made it more clean, modern, and family friendly at this location, but still, it is confusing. Either way, great pizza, go!"}
{"text":"Everyone one has different tastes in food. I go there for the service. The Bartender Marlena is the best. Always makes you feel welcome. 
I have been going there for three years because of her. I miss Joe Diana too, He was also nice. 
Either way I have never gotten bad service from Marlena.

Oh yeah be sure to get the pretzels with the beer cheese, I hope they keep it on the menu permanently this time."}
{"text":"Slow service, servers standing around talking, tables not wiped off and order was messed up.  Seems like this place is going downhill"}
{"text":"I have read some of the reviews and being a bar owner I can tell you this place rocks for beer selection. The pizza is very good but is pricey. $7.00 beers are not expensive if you know what a barrel of micro costs. I go there once a week and have not been disappointed and I highly recommend Rouge Chocolate Stout while waiting on your pizza. I normally drink 2 twenty ouncers and the pie is ready. Yea pricey but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"The variety of beers continues to impress. Each pizza has had a crisp crust with excellent toppings. Happy hour choices are excellent and we've found the service consistently pleasant and competent.  Choose the meatballs for a great start."}
{"text":"They've done some things right and some things wrong.  The sign out front is embarrassing and this is yet another restaurant  in rocky river with bad parking.  But they are smart enough to have valet.  My take out order was cold, even though I was there 15 minutes before they told me to be.  People were nice and the place looks nice inside.  But the 2 star rating is because the food was just not very good.  My half of our pizza was a meat lovers...yet somehow it had almost no flavor.  Maybe they are using all natural, organic ingredients that just don't taste the same.  The crust is spongy, not crisp or chewy.  If you want this type of eclectic pizza, I'd suggest Dewey's in Lakewood.  Same idea, just better execution."}
{"text":"Holy Shittaki? Pizza is my new heaven. I'm usually a pepperoni gal, by style with just some red pepper flakes on top. After trying the pizza here though, I have to say I am a fan. The pizzas are amazing, super fun unique pizzas made with insanely good ingredients, I eat here at least once a week now, pizza for life"}
{"text":"This is for the bar area; I went during happy hour the drinks were decently priced I'm an IPA person so I like that all drinks were happy hour prices. The bar was a little packed but that is to be expected around 530pm. The bartenders were OK, somewhat nonchalant at times, could just be their humor, no harm no foul. Had the whole order of the BBQ wings they were good but definitely better wings else where but again this place is known for pizza not wings so that is that. Overall I was satisfied with the service"}
{"text":"This is the one mellow mushroom that has the best location but worst food. The pizza I had did not sit right in my stomach and I've had prepared at the other locations without this problem. The service was okay. This is a great spot for drunken college kids to get there grub on but not for me. I would rather go to the one closer to house."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, $17 for a cheese pizza that is average .  beer tap list is impressive.  Not sure I would come back for food.  No real complaints just overpriced and unimpressive. . . give it an eahhh!"}
{"text":"My family and me (9 adults) ate early lunch here. The server was terrible. She acted clueless from the time we were seated at a booth. When the food was brought to the table, the  wrong food was placed in front of 3 people and my House pizza came as a cheese pizza. I got to sit and watch my family eat while I waited for another pizza to be made and baked. No one came to the table to explain. Thankfully my family shared some of their food with me while I had to wait another 15 minutes for my food. There was no apology, just the server removing the wrong pizza and telling me they would make and cook another one. My pizza came to the table about the time the others were finishing up their meals and asking for take home boxes. The manager was not at all concerned about this and no comp for my bill was even offered. Some people were offered drink refills others were not even spoken to. Not once in the hour+  we sat there was I asked if I would like more tea. The pizza was kind of bland and disappointing. I won't be eating here again and won't recommend it to anyone else more because of the bad service than the food.  Go elsewhere in Ballantyne to eat. The server missed a good tip because when I get good service I usually leave at least a 25% tip. She got $1 and didn't deserve that much. The wait staff is very under trained and clealry not there  for customer service or to be helpful and welcoming."}
{"text":"This is my second review for Mellow Mushroom - All I can say is that I love this place! As you can see, I am here all the time! The beer selection is fantastic and they continue to bring in new and unique beers that you can't find any where else! The staff is by far the best in the north valley! The servers, bartendars,  and management - all get a Thumbs up! 

My suggestions for this place - 
1. Sit at the bar and meet the locals, you will meet a lot of unique people!
2. While at the bar, talk with the bartendars, they understand and know the beers on tap and can make great recommendations! Dont forget to join the beer club!!!
3. The pizza is fantastic and made from scratch, it will take a little time to cook, be patient, its worth the wait. 
4. Come for happy hour! The appetizers and beer are half off and amazing! Try the meatballs! One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I'm a little apprehensive about giving Mellow Mushroom 5 stars, since I did not actually spend much time in the restaurant. During Tempe Arts Fest they had a table set up selling off slices. My son and I both agreed it was the best pizza we'd ever had. The crust is magnificent. I can only describe it as having a genuine wheat taste to it, simular to a sun-dried tomato bagel. The sauce and cheeze were perfect. I loved the decor inside and all the artistic shirts that were for sale. The folks I spoke to were great and told us about the history of the company. I would love to come back for a full dinner experience. However, based on some reviews, it does indeed appear that there maybe a few employees they need to weed out first. Mello Mushroom are new here, so perhaps they just have to work out a few kinks. I would hate to see an establishment like this fail because of poor customer service. So far, I like what I see, but am withholding my 5 star review till later."}
{"text":"Tried this place after buying a Groupon. We ordered the meatball appetizer and the Magical Mystery Tour pizza. 

The meatball app came with sauce and fresh mozzarella, and I give it two thumbs up. 

The pizza was good too - pesto base, mushrooms, jalape√±o peppers, feta and mozzarella. We both agreed that a salad should have been our appetizer though - way too full afterwards!  I guess that means we liked it though if we cleaned our plates, right?

Overall a good experience, but something was missing. I was really excited to try this place and was expecting to be wowed, but it lacked some sparkle. 

Good beer selection, lots of variety on the menu, but there are other places i want to try before going back."}
{"text":"Clearly, I'm in the minority, but I'm struggling to find good things to say about my experience with this chain.  We've had several take out pizza orders and the latest was the worst.  We ordered the Caesar Salad (re: lettuce and croutons) and marveled that they charged us as much for such.  The pizza (pepperoni and mushroom) was remarkably average with lackluster sauce and ordinary crust.  I won't be fooled again."}
{"text":"I had hoped the experience at this Mellow Mushroom would be entirely consistent with great experiences we have had at Mellow Mushroom restaurants on the east coast.

What a terrible disappointment. Food was fantastic when we eventually got it.!
Service was terrible. Had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a beverage refill!!!
Hello Mellow Mushroom - train your people!!!!! There are way too many other really good restaurants in the immediate are that are real options - no one has to put up with lousy service.

Will be a long time before I go back ... at least at THIS location. Too bad."}
{"text":"Last time I was there the experience was nothing that made me want to go back or even stay and finish my pizza. I have an allergy to tomoatoes and every pizza place I have been to has had some substitution and gotten it right. The service was incredibly slow, the waiter was rude, and the pizza was messed up 3 TIMES!! It was totally unexpected based on other reviews. The food was way over priced for the amiunt of food and with the service being so terrible it was not something I recommend."}
{"text":"First visit here was because of a groupon.  $10 for $20  It was totally worth it!  The pizza was good.  We ordered a large because you do have to use the whole groupon in one trip.  It was great reheated in the following days.  The dough is yummy and not greasy.  We had half cheese and the other half pepperoni, sausage and onion.  We also had the pesto swirl over the whole thing.  My only issue was the poor bartender trying to wait on the lunch crowd.  Too many tables not enough of him."}
{"text":"Stopped back by Mellow Mushroom with my mate Justin from Brew Bros. & a few of our mates Monday afternoon while pub crawling on a day off.  
First I must say my return trip was motivated by an immediate response from to my 1st Yelp review from Mellow Mushroom's owner Jay.  I didnt expect any reponse, much less a return so quickly. Respect for that. Great to see to someone paying such close attention to their customers.
This can only be a good thing.
The same draft selection as the first time around.  48 Handles.  Thats a lot of beer.  As said in my first reiview, with 48 handles I would Love to see more variety and a bit more imagination with respect to the draft beer choices, then again who would complain about a selection w/ at least 40 craft beers on tap?   Thats a real commitment. 
Our bartender Madison was enthusiastic about what she was serving which in Arizona's growing craft beer community is a big plus.  On a another note, this time around the food I ordered made it out of the kitchen rather quickly.  Just a mediterainan salad, but nice.
All said, great to see another craft beer brother join the club.  Nice to have you here."}
{"text":"Edited 8/27/2015. Everything below still stands with exception of the beer sampler. Not on the menu but if you ask nice they will still do one for you. 

============

2012 review:  A great spot that has kept us coming back on a regular basis. With only a couple of exceptions, service is typically very good.

If you visit at peak times (seems to be Friday - Sunday) from dinner time through 8 or 9 -- expect a wait to get a seat and longer times for food to come out...but they are typically good about getting appetizers out in a reasonable time so pick one and enjoy. 

A cool feature about this place is the school bus... a big yellow bus cut open with booths inside. Kids love it and they are free to graffiti the insides.  If you are looking for a more tame, kid-free zone you will want to stay away from the bus.  The outside patio is a perfect spot when weather is nice and they put out heat in the colder months. 

The food is awesome. My personal favorite standbys are either the Kosmic Karma pizza or the Jerk Chicken Hoagie on pita. Unique (wheat?) dough and some funky pizza creations are what they are known best for  I've liked everything I've tried including other pizzas, calzones, and sandwiches.

Beer selection is also top notch. Look at the board near the entrance for any daily drink specials, and check out their beer blends for some interesting mixes of two beers.  If you can't decide from among the long list of craft beers, go for the sampler and pick 4 highball samples to try. 

Overall the food, service, and atmosphere keep us coming back. Well worth a visit if you have not been before."}
{"text":"Bleh.  Server said 3 sentences total to us. Hello, can I get you something to drink? Did you guys decide yet? Here's your check. Pizza is trash. Worse than a chuck-e-cheese. Low quality. The cheese for the pretzels taste like nothing-paste. Puddy for the wall."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service.  Pizza was good, but overpriced.  Overpriced drinks, too, but great beer selection.  I have heard that they are open late every night and have 50% off drinks after 10 PM, but that doesn't help me out much because I am generally asleep by 10 most days.  I would come back because it's in the neighborhood and was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"Our visit to Mellow Mushroom on Saturday afternoon was truly a tale of two waiters.

We arrived around 2:30 for some drinks and maybe an appetizer or two with a friend. Our waiter showed up, and was sort of a tripping kind of 'dude' guy who used the word 'Word' way too often, but was funny, engaging, and on top of things. We ordered our first round of beers, which came out quickly.

Waiter Dude picked up on the fact that my husband likes craft beers, so shortly thereafter he came out with a sample he thought my husband would like. \"Dude, if you like the one you've ordered, you've got to try this one.\" So my husband did. He loved it, and that was ordered for the second round.

Waiter Dude came out with the second round of beers and a sample of another new craft beer for my husband to try. We chatted a bit and decided we'd place a few orders for apps: pretzels, hummus and the oven baked wings. Waiter Dude was awesome, and then he disappeared.

Like, literally, he disappeared. We didn't see him for another thirty minutes. We had to flag down a waitress and ask her about our food order and to please check on it. Three minutes later, our waiter was out with our food, all apologies about how it was held up by a huge pizza order or something like that. He brought no plates or napkins and said he'd be back with them.

And then he disappeared again. For nearly ten minutes. Finally our friend had to get up and go inside to ask for them, and he returned out again, quiet and with apologies, put them down and bailed.

My wings were refrigerator cold the instant they came out of the \"kitchen\" so I seriously doubt they had been held up by busily working on other things. I know this because I didn't bother to wait for the napkins to dig in, I was hungry.

The food really wasn't good, and the service went from quirky and fun to terrible in the blink of an eye. We were there mid-afternoon. It wasn't like there was a rush. I certainly didn't see any huge pizza orders leaving the restaurant, or any huge groups entering the restaurant, and we were outside right by the doors.

It takes effort to screw up a few rounds of beers and apps for 3 people, but Mellow Mushroom managed to. I really want to like this restaurant, but I have never had a reliably good experience there and the food isn't great either. I don't know how they stay in business."}
{"text":"amazing gluten free pizza here! same price as a regular medium pizza and you get a medium! i like that they don't charge extra. calzones are super cheesy and gooey. great selection of beer and drinks, got the pear berry cider and it was great & gluten free. they have a $4.99 lunch special as well as lots of happy hours!"}
{"text":"We were finally seated and our evening improved. Our waitress was very accommodating but our order took awhile to be deliver. The bbq chicken pizza was delicious and the crust nice and chewy the way I like it. The price was reasonable. Other than the slowness of food delivery we had an enjoyable time."}
{"text":"We returned for a second visit after a disappointing first try. There was significant improvement over our first experience.  The server was prompt and returned numerous time to check on us. There still is a disconnect with the bar and wait staff as to what beers are available. Once again after discussing a selection with the server, she returned to advise that they did not carry our selection any longer. This is a repeat problem. Also for some reason, the wait staff cannot seem to remember to give you plates to put your food on. The gluten free pizza was good. We also ordered a salad to share but no utensils to serve it with were provided. Still some issues to work out but a lot better than our first visit."}
{"text":"Let  me start by saying that I ordered the gluten free pizza and it was ok. Though the pizza was ok (nothing special), the atmosphere was overly loud and the service was not very good. My husband and I were dining with friends and we could barely hear each other much less the server who lacked personality and information. I am not sure how the regular pizza is as my hubby ordered gluten free as well but our friend said that his was good. However, from what I saw, his pizza lacked toppings and my friends salad for the price was not overly covered in toppings either. The cost was more than we had anticipated as a cost for my 12 inch gluten free pizza was 19 dollars and since we do not go out as much as others, that seems a lot for what you got. I am not sure if we will be going back and we were not overly impressed. We went because of a groupon that we purchased so I am not sure if I would pay full price for this average pizza."}
{"text":"We love the food here, but to be honest, we won't be going here again. We waited an hour for our personal pizzas, it was freezing, it is extremely loud and the service is sub-par. We had to wave down another waiter for our check, and even that took forever. Honestly, this place needs a quicker and more efficient way to cook the pizzas. Waiting an hour is not acceptable."}
{"text":"I love the spinach salad (spinach, apples, dried cherries & feta).  The pizza was also good (pepperoni & cheese); however there was too much crust (not enough cheese, sauce, etc).  We ordered the pretzels as an appetizer, and we we were disappointed when the pizza came out first.  However, the salt & butter pretzels are delicious!  The server was very attentive & friendly."}
{"text":"Went back a second time cuz so good the first. Was just as good....better. Happy hour 3-6pm ALL apps &  drinks half $. Pretzels with beer chz xlnt. Pear cocktail xlnt.
Beautiful bathroom.
Try the fantastic AMC theater with all new interior nearby. Seats recline to laying down, all u can drink self serve soda, super clean."}
{"text":"This place has amazing pizza!! Also they have a really good happy hour! Jackie W is the sweetest server and does a great job!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and wings. The Tempe location has better/bigger wings while the happy valley location has better pizza. For example last time we order wings at happy valley the waiter notified us his boss said to bring us another plate of wings because of how small they looked. I appreciate the service but eating 20 wings was excessive for an appetizer for just me an my girlfriend. Anyways the real focal point of mellow mushroom is their happy hour and beer selection. They once had an awesome groupon that could  be used on happy hour.... mind blowing."}
{"text":"When we first went to this place, we had the Pizza.  It was really good.  So, since Friday is our \"burger day\" we decided to go back and try the burger.

We arrived at the restaurant around 4:00pm.  This is a big restaurant and there was nobody in the restaurant except a couple of guys at the bar.  We were seated and proceeded to look at the menu.  My wife ordered a small chef salad, I ordered the only burger on the menu.  It was $11.00 so I thought this \"has\" to be good ... right?

While waiting for our \"food\", a family came in, and the host seated them right behind us. THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT IS AVAILABLE, but we get the family right behind us.  I don't dislike families, but do object to the two 4-year-old's, who sat behind me, continuously kicking the seat, staring at my wife and running back and forth on the seat like they were in some kind of marathon.  Again, I have no problems with family.  Love children.  But a dining out experience should not include hearing nothing but screaming kids and their kicking on the seats.

Finally, the \"food\" arrived.   The salad was huge for a small, and the burger \"looked\" tasty.  They only offer Swiss cheese and I've never had a burger with Swiss cheese, and now know why.  The waitress looked at the empty bottle of catsup and said \"Huh, that looks empty\", and sat it down on the table.

It was absolutely the worse thing I have ever tried to digest.   It had absolutely NO FLAVOR.  How do you do that.  How do you make a burger with absolutely no flavor?????   It had something cheese on it, that was also flavorless.  There were two pickles on the plate that actually tasted like pickles, but that's about it.  It came with these potato things that also, had no flavor.   Eleven bucks for two tiny pickle slices that taste like pickles.   What a deal.

My wife HATED the salad.   It was served it in a slanted bowl, making it impossible to mix together when you add the dressing.   OH YEA, DON'T EVER ORDER THE \"HOUSE\" DRESSING.  IT'S AWFUL.  There was a small amount of toppings but it was mostly lettuce.

When the bill arrived, we discovered that even though my wife ordered the SMALL salad, she had received a LARGE. So, since everything about this dining \"Experience\" was HORRIBLE,  what kind of tip should one leave for a waitress who: serves tasteless food, places the wrong order, presents you with an empty catsup bottle, never asks how the swill tastes, and seats the Brady bunch, HIGH ON SUGAR, right behind you to kick the hell out of the seat while running some kind of a marathon?

The exclamation point to this disaster was, while we were attempting to dine on this swill, a \"homeless looking\" waiter, with more hair than sasquatch, walked by our table, picking at the wax in his ears, and twisting the ear hairs together for what I assumed was some kind of macram√© class.

We don't care how good the pizza was the first time, we will never, ever, ever, ever consider this place for anything but an eyesore on the landscape that we occasionally have to drive past.

Oh yea, I stated to the BIMBO host that the \"food\" was absolutely TERRIBLE, she said \"well, have a nice day\".  It must be the policy of Mellow Mushroom to just hire idiots?"}
{"text":"We went to Mellow Mushroom on a Sunday evening. The place was fairly busy, but not completely packed. The atmosphere is rather nice and there is a movie theme that the whole place is done up in. 
Our server told us that pizza takes about 25 minutes to bake, and apparently salads take just as long. Our service was not ideal- no refills, never asked if everything worked out. It was a very minimal service on our server's part. 
The salad, imo, is rather overpriced. I did an a la carte/build your own style- and a dollar's worth of tomato equates to four slices. 2 dollars of cheese is about a teaspoon of cheddar, and 2.50 worth of turkey is about like.. two slices of lunch meat crumbled up in the corner. 
Mind you, the quality of the salad ingredients wasn't bad- but hte portion was not equivalent to price paid. Plus, the thousand island tastes like you took a bite of Miracle Whip and called it dressing. My companion's salad was about hte same- very minimal on the toppings and their dressing tasted like lemon juice and garlic. 

All in all, I don't think I'll be returning. The price of the food mixed with the low quality service doesn't make me inclined to come back."}
{"text":"I wish I could say my experience eating in the restaurant was so much better, but it was not. We waited a very long time, more than 30 minutes, to get our BBQ chicken style pizza. I was very excited to try it, smelled good, looked great with lightly browned crust. But when we started to eat it, we discovered that the dough under the toppings was still raw. From my experience cooking pizza at home, it means the oven was too hot. We asked our waitress if this was done right, she said she didn't know because she wasn't eating the pizza. I showed her again, she offered to recook a new pizza but my husband remarked will it come out the same? Is this how your crust is? She said, once again she didn't know. I remarked that she, as a waitress, should know if this is how the crust is supposed to look-if this is how a new pizza would turn out we don't want to wait another 30 minutes to get another pizza with that same crust. Very rude employees here, they just don't give a hoot. I have only good things to say of the owner, but would recommend he retrain his employees in the art of customer service and the food that is on the menu."}
{"text":"It's decent with cool themes at various locations. However, the gluten free and vegan options are pretty slim and pricey, esp for the size. They are open late which is nice."}
{"text":"My family and I visited this place about a week ago. We are gluten-free and some of us are vegan as well. They do offer options for all of these needs but they do cost more, alot more!!!

We ordered one vegan, gluten-free pizza and one gluten-free pizza with vegan cheese and meat (for a person who can't eat dairy). We got our food and half way through eating our vegan pizza we found what appeared to be sausage on it!! There were a few small pieces, but I'm vegan for several reasons and don't want ANY animal products on my food!!!  The other pizza came out with dairy cheese on it...so we had to ask the server to come check it out...he tried to convince us that it was garlic or something (anything other than meat) on our pizza which wasn't true at all!
Finally the kitchen manager came out and looked at it and re-made both pizzas for us. A very nice gesture that was greatly appreciated. It was a bit frustrating because we had a 2 year old with us who was hungry and we had to tell him (after waiting a long time already) that he had to wait again to get more pizza without any meat on it. They were friendly about correcting the issue and the second round of pizzas were properly made. They also discounted our bill for the inconvenience which was also greatly appreciated.

We took the uneaten portion of of our food and boxed it up and donated it to one of the many hungry people who hang out on Mill Ave looking for donations. I suppose in the end it worked out well for everyone and that's awesome!

The place was extremely loud and we could hardly hear the waiter taking our order which was a bit annoying but it was a weekend night in a college area so that's to be somewhat expected...esp when they serve a lot of booze ;)"}
{"text":"This is NOT thin crust pizza...  overall the pizza is alway good. Prices are very inline with other pizza places for the amount and quality you receive. My kids really like the game tables upstairs."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The first time we went it was fantastic.. after a few months it is like the service has went downhill .. last two times order was not even taken correctly, wrong drinks and pizza !  Asked if server was new they said no and wanted to argue !  We will not be back. Hope management cleans up there or they not be open through 2017."}
{"text":"Went last night wanting pizza and a tv to watch a game.   The game was on but the service wasn't.  Slow service, loud music and average food.    Pizza was good but pretzel bites were over done and prime eye pizza was lacking the meat.   The biggest downer was my 13 year old even said the music was obnoxious.   Waited too long for food."}
{"text":"One of the stars I gave Mellow Mushroom may have just been because I was so excited to see it come back to Charlotte.  I shed many tears when the previous franchiser closed down his doors while trying to break away and open Moon Dog.  Bleh.

I have had three great experiences so far at the new Mellow Mushroom in Myers Park.  Going exclusively on Friday or Saturday night, I've never actually had to wait more than 10-15 minutes.  The staff is working hard to get people seated and keep people informed of their wait.

The bar area is nice and open, although it would be nice to have a little bit more space to congregate, rather than backing up onto tables if you're two deep at the bar.

They have great selections on draught beer.  I was excited to see that they had a lot of North Carolina beer on tap like Big Boss and OMB.

The food is pretty consistent with what you love and know from Mellow Mushroom.  I think they still have some kinks to work out with their pricing and/or the waitstaff's knowledge of how to key things in.  For Example:

Got a cheese calzone with buffalo chicken in it (effectively a buffalo chicken calzone).  The first time I was charged correctly ($7.95 for a cheese calzone + $2 for buffalo chicken), second time not so much ($11.95 for a chicken calzone? + $2 for buffalo chicken).  I didn't realize the mistake until later, but consistency should come through experience over there.

Overall, excited to have MM back in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Good vegan choice.  The vegan cheese was not off putting on the pizza.  Decent pretzels.  I think i will skip the butter on the crust next time though."}
{"text":"I waited months before finally getting around to coming here, and it wasn't all I had hoped for. Went for my birthday, and got the garlic bread appetizer, wasn't very good and got crumbs all over the table. It had an odd burnt taste. Got the mushroom and steak calzone, which was huge and filling, but very greasy and took a long time to actually get to the table. They claimed it was the Hoagie that one of my friends had that took so long, but it shouldn't take so long to cook a sandwich. Either way, delicious, but nothing too special for the price. I won't likely return here, since some of my friends don't like this place."}
{"text":"Walked out after waiting 2.5 hours for a cheese pizza and a calzone which never arrived.  Service was terrible. There were lots of empty tables so didn't understand why it was taking so long but do understand the empty tables. Avoid."}
{"text":"Met the family for pizza and beer last night and had a great experience. Is our second time meeting there and both times the service was great as well as the pizza. I recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"I walked in this new hot spot because people are just in love with a new place when it opens and can't wait to spend their hard earned money at a place that serves pizza. Walked in, greeted by a girl at the front. I was there 1 1/2 hours before they close.The bar had plates and other crap on the counter top so if you sat down you had to look at the used plates--nice. So I stood for a minute or so and looked around the joint while I studied the menu.I wasn't sure if I wanted to eat there or do a take out. But when I saw $24.99 for a fricken pizza and I am in Rocky River and not New York City, YIKES ==GET ME THE FRICK OUT OF THERE. The day I spend $24.99 on the pizza, I will stop eating pizza. I AM NOT A SUCKER.I wondered while i looked around at the clowns eating there--\"are they the same clowns that want money off the sticker when they buy a CAR or want MORE MONEY FOR THEIR GARBAGE TRADE IN.\" IF SO, THEY DESERVE OOGOTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T DESERVE IT AND ARE SUCKERS. You want pizza at the best in Cleveland--go to Berea =CAPRI pizza on every Tuesday--'\"18 inch pie for $9.95 that tastes just as good as New York pizza. So order 3 of them for the price of one at a chain joint called Mellow Mushroom. With '60's decor maybe we need to eat mushrooms,do LSD,and smoke a big ass joint and get stoned so we don't know what the price of the over-rated $24.99 pizza is. Have a good time."}
{"text":"Having eaten at several Mellow Mushrooms before, I was looking forward to this location's opening. My first visit, though, was a bit disappointing. The music was way too loud, and my pizza was under cooked and soupy. Service was great. I will definitely go back and see if I just hit a bad day."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza that I have had! I have heard a few folks say that it is pricey, really? Well let's see it has REAL mozzarella cheese and the best crust around - the only pizza that I like to eat backwards! 

I was greeted with a smile from the hostess and set at a clean table, offered a drink right away. Yes, the pizza takes a bit longer than 5 minutes, but it is so worth the wait.(with that being said, it still was not longer than 20 minutes - during lunch rush) There is one more thing that I noticed about this dining establishment  ---- the ice tea! It is a dead giveaway to me when a restaurant is below the standards of what I like and that is the ice tea - I know snobby right, but still there is nothing like eating great food only to be ruined by the bitter taste of day old tea - but not here! The tea was fresh and tasty just like everything else on the menu. When my friends and I were eating we had not only the server check on us but the manager Ryan would come by to see if we needed anything!!!

** I was so impressed by Mellow Mushroom that I bought a couple of the Shirts. I highly recommended that you go see for yourself, you will not be disappointed! **"}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is extremely slow. Whole lotta of people in the kitchen standing around doing nothing. Took 40 minutes to get my food. Not cool."}
{"text":"Awful service -complained and the manager did not have the courage to come fix the issue. Disappointed. The bar service was awful. Food was good, but service was terrible."}
{"text":"Service was slow from our waitress. Food takes some time to come out but that is because it's made fresh. Jerk chicken sub and buffalo chicken pizza were both top notch eats. Dough for the pizza was excellent."}
{"text":"I have given this location several chances but every time, something has been wrong:  

1. Ordered a takeout salad with chicken (paid extra for the chicken) and got home, there was no chicken on it. 
2. Dined in for dinner and ordered wings, they were served ice cold. 
3. Stopped by at lunch to grab a quick slice, ended up waiting at least 10 minutes for the manager to ultimately hand me a slice that had been sitting there the whole time (and before that, I had asked her a simple menu question and she basically said she didn't know and didn't make an attempt to find the answer which was bizarre). 

I've been to the Selwyn location multiple times and never had an issue, I would recommend going there instead of the uptown location. Everyone just seems to be out of sorts all the time, even when it's not busy, and service is slow."}
{"text":"Great place to stop if in town for business. Beer selection is decent and the outdoor bar is key. The food was pretty good considering. I would recommend going here"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED this pizza and would say it is the best we have had in years! Our bartender suggested the house special pizza and also let us know that they were \"trending on Groupon right now\". So we checked it out on our phones and it saved us ten bucks. With the savings we stayed for another beer after eating the pizza! Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"We were excited for this place to open until we ate there. It was truly nothing special. We ordered two pizzas (one was the \"phiosophers pie\") and neither one of them was very good. I hate to be negative but c'mon people, pizza is really not that hard to get right. Anyway, I won't be spraining any ankles running back to this place. Especially if I am paying $60 for two pizzas, two sodas and two beers."}
{"text":"Glad that we found a place with an atmosphere reminiscent of our Blind Onion at home. MM has an excellent beer selection, which is great for self proclaimed beer snobs like my BF and  I. For the life of me, I cannot figure out how someone would drink a Girl's Light when there are so many more fantastic tasty beers available! But I digress....So far the only pizza we tried has been the buffalo chicken. I didn't expect it to be good, but it was! Fresh ingredients are clearly obvious. The only draw back is that it is a bit on the pricey side, but I am definitly up to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"My family was here from Florida during Christmas holidays and we love pizza.  We went here twice.  Best pizza in town in my opinion.  We started with the cheese bread.  We then had two pizzas.  Both were hot, tasty and delicious!  Our waitress was right there all throughout the meal.  We met Amy one of the managers.  She made sure everything went well for us because she remembered us from our first time there for dinner during the holidays.  She also threw in the cheese bread for free!!  We were thrilled with everything!  My 14 year old niece enjoyed it very much too.  We LOVE Mellow Mushroom!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for dinner last night.  We had the Greek salad and Kosmic Karma pizza.   The staff was friendly and helpful.   The Greek salad was OK,  but I really liked the pizza.   We were looking for a Margarita type but the Kosmic was close and maybe a little better with the pesto sauce on top."}
{"text":"I just got done having a dinner at this establishment that was full of both highs and lows. The tossed salad to start was pleasing (after I had to ask two different waiters twice for the dressing I wanted) and the pretzels were to die for once the fruit flies that surrounded them cleared the premise and I could could squeeze in a bite. The pizza was mediocre at best kind of like any Adam Sandler that came out post 2000. Take Grown Ups for example. Grown Ups is a \"solid\" movie with a fairly interesting and believable plot and I enjoyed watching it but if someone ever came up to me and asked me about the movie I would probably respond with an \"eh\" or an \"it was alright\". This is very equivalent to the mellow mushroom. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. At the end of the day they serve solid food but there are a few \"plot holes\" such as the wait staff and sanitation."}
{"text":"Their pizza and beer cheese dip for the pretzel appetizers are to die for! I also love coming here for reverse happy hour and for their great beer selection."}
{"text":"Mellow mushroom has fantastic pizza! My son the pizza fanatic and my husband are hooked. Their wings are always a big hit but as of late they've been too generous on the drumettes and stingy with the flats. We ordered 10 wings for my daughter and she got 8 drumettes and 2 flats!! No bueno so you might want to clarify your desires right when you order.
 I've used the yelp check in offer at two different locations and boy did the portion sizes differ. I ordered the hummus and pita and this location gave me a small scoop of hummus but when I was in Greenville they gave me a generous portion with plenty of pita. But I guess I can't complain about free. 
What I love now as a new vegan (how long I'll last, I don't know) is that they have vegan pizza options! We ordered the vegan vegout pizza and they skip the buttered crust and substitute with vegan cheese! My daughter and I loved it but hubby wasn't feeling the vegan cheese. Texture issue he says. We've also had the Caesar salad (prevegan days), the Greek salad, the avocado sub and the tofu sub. All were great except the tofu sub! Too wet and too many soft textures. 
I'm taking a star off because this place doesn't offer French fries! I know they don't have deep fryers but what about throwing them in the oven? And I asked for extra onions on my pizza and they charged me $2.00!! If the server had informed me that I'd be charged that, I would have skipped the extra onions. And I couldn't really tell that there was extra because it looked like it always does. Lesson learned! 
The service here is always great and the manger has always come around to check on us so no complaints there. Great place for pizza and great place for vegans so they don't feel left out when eating out with family and friends. 

That is all!"}
{"text":"Our favorite late night spot that really saved our Sunday night party!!

Sitting in the area just west of the bar- we enjoyed our server Erica who was timely & friendly. 

We order our favorite extra crispy double baked Thai chili wings (5).The wings are actually double baked and perfectly crispy & the perfect combo of 2 drumsticks and 3 wings with the double bones.  Love the sweet Thai chili sauce too- not very spicy but a unique twist.

The Caesar pizza really rocked- pretty sure they put butter in the crust.  The pesto chicken and cheese pizza was on the thinner side with a 1\" Parmesan butter crust.    They top this with Caesar salad tomatoes and shaved Parmesan which was a nice crunch!  We love pizza with salad on top- sauce has a good one too.

For drinks he did a Moscow mule and I tried a limited time draught that was not on the menu- undercover cucumber.  A light filtered lager style beer the cucumber was very very subtle.  Loved it!!  Thank you to Erica for mentioning this and offering a sample. 

We finished with a Reese's peanut butter cup cookie ice cream sundae.  This was a slightly warmed cookie with ice cream chocolate & whipped cream.  Nothing to complain about!

We will be back again as we truly enjoy the lively but not overly crowded atmosphere of this particular location.  We always notice servers from other nearby restaurants eating here in groups- best reverse happy hour ever!  Half price drinks & munchies after 10pm."}
{"text":"I really wish we didn't go here.  What a waste of money. Our server was nice the food was horrible. Pizza was a step above chuckie cheese pizza.  Way too much sauce, I couldn't even pick it up to eat it. We also got the pretzels but they tasted more like the pizza crust.  Every thing is over priced, even their drinks...I got a got a glass of wine which by the way was under poured. If you don't mind paying over $20 for a pizza then this is your place."}

We first visited the new location a few days after they opened.  We expected that within the first few days, some things would be slower than normal and that's fine. We entered and found the lobby area to be chaos with people milling around either waiting to be seated or trying to figure out how/where to get takeout. 

Seating:  We were finally seated after a reasonable wait. They took us to a section in the back near the kitchen. It's behind a wall and underneath the stairs. DO NOT ever let them seat you there. It was very loud and very cramped. There was a large group behind us and we might as well have been sitting at their table. I had to move my chair to the side of our table because as it was set up, the servers kept bumping into me every time they walked past. It's just really not a great set up.  The server was pleasant, but before we even ordered, she warned us twice that the kitchen was going to be very slow. OK, the warning was good and understandable for the first week.

Food:  Here is where we made our mistake. We ordered a 14 inch pizza but asked for some extra cheese. Just a bit extra, but not double the normal cheese. The pizza came out about 40 minutes later (slow kitchen) and was horrendous. There was so much cheese and sauce that you couldn't pick up a slice. It was not good, but in the kitchen's defense, we did ask for extra cheese. We ate with fork & knife because it was the only way to eat the goopy mess. Lesson learned:  No extra cheese.  Overall, we left unsatisfied with the pizza, but figured it was partially our own fault for asking for something different.

Visit #2 (5 stars)
Our second trip was fantastic. We were seated quickly upstairs and the atmosphere was 100x better than the corner they put us in the previous time. Our server was friendly and fairly attentive. A manager stopped by to ask us how everything was.  The pizza (same order as last time, but WITHOUT the extra cheese) was perfect. It was the pizza we had come to expect from the Selwyn location.  All was good and we looked forward to our next visit.

Visit #3 (0 stars)
It became very clear to us in our third visit that this restaurant is understaffed and overwhelmed.  Our third visit was greeted by the same entry area chaos as the first visit.  We were finally seated in a nice booth to the left side of the restaurant. Our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the exact same pizza as in visit #2 that we enjoyed so much.  The pizza took 45 minutes to arrive and our server kept coming by to apologize for the delays. The booth behind us was complaining constantly to the server about the wait.  The table to our side was served salad without dressing and had to wait a long time to get the dressing.  But, back to our pizza. Remember how wonderful it was in visit #2?  It was nearly unrecognizable.  The cheese was a soupy mess and there was a huge puddle of oil/grease in the center.  The cheese and sauce didn't go near the edges, so the crust was huge sections of bubbled dough with no toppings. We told our server that it didn't look good and she agreed.  Because we were in a hurry (and had already waited 45 minutes for the pizza), we decided to make the best of it and try to eat it.  The server said she would get a manager to come by. The manager never came. We did our best to eat the pizza. If I was MM management, I would be embarrassed to serve that pizza. We finally got our check and found that they had comped us for one soda.  Not the pizza, not two sodas.  One soda. Still no manager.  I asked for a to-go cup for my soda before we left and the server said she would get me one. Apparently, my request was rhetorical because we never saw the server again. 

If this was our first trip there, we would never return. It was that bad. I hope management gets stuff ironed out quickly. It's apparent that the entry area needs to be changed/improved. They may want to move the takeout orders to the end of the bar or further from the masses waiting to be seated. Most disturbing so far has been the wild inconsistency in the pizza. We plan to give it another try at some point because we know how good it can be. Overall, it's only 2 stars for us."}
{"text":"The food is always great. Our server Danny is very thorough at explaining pricing and options for dietary needs. This is interior is better than those at Wilmington."}
{"text":"I have had mellow mushroom in other cities and enjoyed the food far more than this location. Hope they can get it right soon because it is a great location and cool ambiance."}
{"text":"Slow service, pizza is too expensive for the quality, ordered dessert to go and it came in a prepackaged plastic container. Not impressed. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Poorly managed.  We came in on a Friday evening and waited over 25 minutes.  We informed the staff that we were there and they told us that it would be 10-15 min, no one ever came to our table. The place was not overly crowded, plenty of open tables. We ended up leaving. How can you not be on your A game on a Friday night. On a separate occasion we came in having freshly come from a nearby Starbucks. We were turned away at the door because we would not through away our full coffees. We ended up going next door to a restaurant that had no problem with our coffees. These events have left a sour taste in my mouth for your establishment!"}
{"text":"Pizza is mediocre, at best. I went with a group and had a good selection of different pies. The pizza was not hot when it came to the table, and when we looked at the bill, it was almost $30 for a large pizza!!!!! Trust me, you aren't paying for the service either! Unless there are flakes of gold on a pizza, $30 is a rip off. Wouldn't recommend & will not go again. If you want good pizza, order in or go to Oreganos down the street."}
{"text":"I debated with giving Mellow Mushroom a 4 star, but I definitely think it is a 3.5.  Charlotte is lacking in the \"great\" pizza department, but Mellow comes close.  Let the analysis begin:

Food:  Mellow Mushroom has many creative dishes and goes beyond just pizza.  Their salads and apps are excellent.  They also have calzones  (I think they are a better value than the pizza if you are going for an individual).  Most recently I got the Philospher's pie (steak!) and hummus - which were both tasty!

Ambiance:  this operation is a little more done up than some of the other MMs I've been to.  They have a colorful bus and many interesting things to look at.  I specifically enjoyed the little springy mushrooms by the booths.  They move and bounce, try it out.

Location:  location in Myer's Park is excellent, one of my favorite little areas near Selwyn Pub and Yoforia!!  Perfect for post mellow drinks or desert.

Service:  the service wasn't outstanding.  I ran out of water and never got a refill and was extremely thirsty!

Final Comments:  MM is not your typical pizza place.  It has it's own little niche in the world of pizza that I can appreciate, is customizable and a general crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Great service. Packed inside but speedy time tp get food. Pizza is my favorite . As i have travled and loved every Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"First time here, and after so many rave reviews we decided it was definitely worth a go...

Having heard so  much about the pretzels, they were definitely first on the list of things to try.  1/2 off for happy hour, I was pretty glad.  We got the garlic and parm type.  The boyfriend claimed delicious, I went with \"eh\". Mostly parm and very little garlic, they weren't my fave, but I think next time we will try the salt with mustard sauce and they might be more of a crowd pleaser.

Really wish I could do an \"and a half\" star rating here (come on Yelp..you know we all want that ability, lol) because the ability to get a pizza split in half so you don't have to choose just one of their signature pies was definitely a plus and would warrant an extra half star point.  We got the small pizza and asked our server which she preferred between the two we had narrowed it down to, she told us what she thought, but followed it up with \"if you like we can just make it a half & half?\" YES!  Awesome, perfect for the indecisive, and very hard to find, as most places with more complex pizzas do not allow this.  We ended up getting a half Potato Pie and half Caesar pizza.  The boy loved the Potato, said it reminded him a bit of his favorite potatoes au gratin. And I was a fan of the Caesar.  It was a nice blend between ooey gooey hot pizza and cool crisp salad, and I'm into flavor and texture contrasts in my meals.  The crust was a lil difficult to cut with a knife, and these were definitely more of the \"fork n knife\" type pizzas, but I can't tell for sure if it was the crust itself or just a crappy knife?!

We ordered dessert, Key Lime Pie was nice, just the right size... and I definitely think they used Ready Whip... Don't get me wrong.. this is a good thing.. love that shit..reminds me of being a lil kid.

They have a nice variety of beer and Happy Hour puts 98% if them half off.

The service was pretty good.  Pleasant and helpful, but not too pushy.  And considering we went for early happy hour and sat in the dining room (we were the only table our server had at the time) she still paid just the right amount of attention to us, which is great because frequently in other places under those circumstances one will get forgotten about half the time.

Overall a nice place, dig the decor, super bright.  Food was good, haven't quite decided if it was crave-able yet though.  Will for sure give the place another go and see if I leave wanting more."}
{"text":"We came in today as \"first timers\". I have two words for you... NEVER AGAIN!
To start off with, the waitresses comes to our table and says \"before you order, I've got to let you know that we do things around here differently and this isn't Dominoes.\"   

When the food arrived, the pizza was pretty good. The sandwich was a train wreck. The sauce was cold by the time it reached our table and the meatballs inside were small. I thought a meatball sandwich was supposed to have meatballs. These were unappetizing. Within this 10'' hoagie were only two meatballs sliced in half to appear that the sandwich had four meatballs. What the heck? The bread was over cooked and just plain nasty. 

After catching our waitresses attention, we notified her of this issue and that the remainder (2'') should be taken away. After another twenty (20) minutes of waiting for some kind of word, she comes back with the bill and didn't take it off. I was NOT going to pay for something I found unappealing and bland - I've had something better off a Roach Coach for a quarter of the price that tasted like it was made in a traditional Italian household. Only one good thing came from this dish, the Poor Brothers potato chips served on the side. We asked her why this was still on our bill and she low-browed us and asked \"Are you kidding? We've been told our food is the best\". We said \"yes, your pizza is good, but i asked you earlier if you meatballs were hand made here or were something you purchased. There was no way that was a handmade meatball sandwich. This is something you purchase from a vendor.\" She replied \"Well, I don't know about that.\" WE WERE LIED TO ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE FOOD FROM THE BEGINNING. Her next question was \"You want me to get the manager?\" and I said \"No, I want you to take it off the bill. She replied \"I'll see what I can do.\" She said she would be right back. She never returned.

{"text":"I have not been to this location in a while and now i remember why. Each time different bartenders doing poor service work....The waitresses (2 of them young ladys) went back and forth ignoring our group at the bar where they were working. We have to wait 20 minutes to get a drink and there not very busy??. They were not busy just playing around. Slow to get orders our food orders / drink refills. They kept just looking up like there being bothered working there and one would come (mind you each is on different side of bar why cant we get one bartender?) over 20 minute  waiting each time fill our orders not the same girls each time although there not busy??

When the bill came we tried to ask about being charged for drink we did not order. The one of the you girls bartender does not even look at the bill she just yells out load that her and the other bartender saw us have every one of those drinks? Really you do not even look at it the bill to see whats on it at all ? Mind you the two of you have been nonchalantly filling orders back and forth and playing around. They had added 2 drinks we did even have and messed up the food order?? And the no one will even look at the bill or even ask the other bartender if she think if it is a mistake? 

The guy on duty at bar(mgr?) has been their a few years and he is a pro. The rest of the staff mess up orders, are slow and always playing on there phones or just not doing anything standing around. They act like they dont even want to be here.. 

Dont get me wrong love the food but i will go to the Tempe or Nortera location if in the area just not my neighborhood Mellow Mushroom. This is the same stuff has happened every-time we go to Desert Ridge. The staff (except the Mgr) stinks --so they lost a group of people who wont come back for good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here last Wednesday before heading to a Charlotte Knights game. 

The location is super convenient (we walked so I can't speak to parking) to alot of areas in Uptown. The restaurant was fairly busy but we were able to grab a seat outside. It feels a bit odd cause the restaurant isn't decorated like your typical Shroom location. It feels like they may have just tried a bit too hard to get that Uptown feel.

The beer list is fairly large with a good amount of local selections. I had a Red Oak (my go to beer of choice!) and my husband had a Porter or Stout....must have spaced out while he ordered cause I have no idea what he had!

Since we have recently been trying to eat less meat, we ordered a medium pizza off their speciality summer menu (I believe it was called Tempeh-rarily...or something like that!). It was delish! Tempeh, artichoke, pineapple, mushrooms, pesto, and an olive oil base! A medium was perfect size for us. Actually, it may have been a bit too large.

Food was delish and exactly what we expected from a Mellow Mushroom. However, service was awful! We were there almost 2 hours with 80% of it just waiting. Normally, it wouldnt be a huge deal, but we were trying to get to a Knights game and ended up getting there at the bottom of the 6th inning because of the super long wait. The waitress was super sweet when we chatted with her, but for the most part she was MIA. 

We will absolutely return, just not when we are in a rush!"}
{"text":"I love Mellow Mushroom!! They have great vegan and gluten free options, and their veggie pizza is so unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Being in the food industry, I try not to complain because everyone has their off days. Servers, at the end of the day, are only human. However, at this location, I feel like the Bartenders are always annoyed. They're open until 2:00 am, so when a group of people walk in at 11:00, they have no reason to roll their eyes or make the guests feel like they're disturbing them. You have to wait at least 10 minutes before they walk over with menus (It's seat-yourself at night) and then getting their attention throughout the entire meal is next to impossible. And they have never brought the check without me having to walk over to the bar and ask them for it. One time my friend and I did an experiment and stacked our plates at the end of the table so we looked finished, and waited for our check rather than walk over and get it, and no one came over to our table for 45 minutes!! We planned on just grabbing a drink and a quick bite to eat after a long day at work, but it turned into a 3 hour dinner.

I usually go to Mellow at least once a week because I love the food and the Happy Hour prices (That's why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1). It's just not a good feeling, feeling like you're inconvencing someone or bugging them when you're only asking them to do their job. I'm not saying you shouldn't go there...again, I love the food and all of the vegetarian options, however, just keep in mind that you will feel like you're bothering them if you walk in after 10 pm."}
{"text":"This Is one of those must try kind of places. 47 beers on tap...with updated  beer menu's. Which this time of year not easy to maintain with all those wonderful fall brews coming in and out. Which by the way....they have all of them on hand. ...WOW!  Food great, pizzeria style menu....staff has been
 very attentive and knowledgeable.  Family friendly,  lets face it. This place gets my first 5 star rating in 3 yrs. Go see Gen or Jarod behind the bar, you won't want to leave. Fantastic service!!!"}
{"text":"We were eating a late dinner after a family wedding and this was one of the few places open. We looked them up online to make sure we knew what we were getting and the service was pleasant, the food however leaves something to be desired. The meatball sub was super messy, over sauced, which made the bread soggy and the cheese was stuck to the wrapper. The steak sub, which we special ordered to have no mayo, in fact did have mayo and this made it inedible for one of us. The pretzel bites tasted more like garlic knots, but to be fair I think that was what they were going for. Sorry, but not worth the $25 we paid for it all."}
{"text":"Not sure why others are down on this place. It's obviously more of a bar than a restaurant so I wouldn't have expected world class cuisine. All of the food I have had here has been good for bar food. The real reason to come is their amazing selection of beers on tap, which seems to be a rarity in these parts. They also have an excellent happy hour from 3-6 when every drink and appetizer is half off. The service was a bit hit or miss depending on the server, but not bad at all. Good amount of outdoor seating but could probably do with being expanded if possible."}
{"text":"Friend and I went for lunch, used a groupon, a little pricey for lunch but our server Dante was awesome, just the perfect amount of mellow/chill and attentive/professional, the apitizer and pizza was really good. I don't know if it's always like that but go around 1-2 in the summer and it's really quiet and great place to have lunch in peace."}
{"text":"I would say overall mediocre.  Every time we try it I always think it will be better this time and it hasn't been.  The items all seem to be lacking in flavor, especially the pizza and calzones.  The wings taste generic and last time we ordered them to go they were actually overcooked and too crisp to enjoy.  The pretzels are good."}
{"text":"Great pizza but pretty pricey. Good beer list and good vibes, but service can be slow. Nice outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Red potato is delicious! Probably the best pizza on the menu:). Secondly would be the buffalo chicken pizza. 

Do not get the wings though! Overpriced and fatty! Ugh. All in all good place for pizza!"}
{"text":"We grabbed dinner here the other night.  We got bruschetta for an app and it was surprisingly one of the best ones I have had at a restaurant.  The veggies were fresh and their balsamic was perfect!

I got the Umami Pizza (bacon, caramelized onions, pineapple and jalapenos!)  It was absolutely perfect.  The flavors were all there and in the right proportions.  I was so happy I ordered this!"}
{"text":"Chill atmosphere, normal wait that you know will happen with pizza - but it's delicious.  

Also dogs are allowed on patio."}
{"text":"Great experience! Got seated immediately. Waitress was very attentive and management was on top of their game. Would definitely go back with family and friends. Pizza tasted good and came out quickly after ordering. Ingredients were very fresh. Keep up the good vibes Mellow Mushroom!"}
{"text":"Visited this location on Sunday for dinner.  We ordered a medium Pizza half chicken cesar and half cheese. Also ordered another medium pizza with pepperoni,  mushrooms, jalape√±os and onions.  Had a side of medium hot wings.  Both pizza's and wings were delish!  I totally recommend this place.  We will for sure be returning.  Also...our waiter was cool and did a good job."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. My boyfriend and I walked in on a Sunday night when it wasn't busy at all. We sat at our table for 15 minutes before we had to find someone to take our order. We also tried to ask the bartender for help who was extremely rude and brushed us off. He also didn't make a single drink while we were there. We watched our server make our drinks. Very disappointed in how this location is treating their customers."}
{"text":"Love this place! These people really know there stuff. Can answer any question my picky boyfriend has on beer!"}
{"text":"Meh.... Is what comes to mind with this pizza joint. 

What's good: 

The place is clean and the server was upbeat and attentive (for the most part). 

The pizza is good, I order a seasonal speciality pizza. It came out piping hot forcing me to make those goofy open mouth sucking air faces. 

The place is spacious and clean. They have a bar with plenty of beer on tap. 


What's not so good: 

The prices, wtf why is one pie $30 freaking bucks. OK okaay I'll  admit I have been judged as a cheap skate in the past but cmon man. 

I have not tried enough of the pizzas at this place to get a good feel for the overall menu. The southwestern pizza I had was nice but it did not have heat (seasoning) I prefer."}
{"text":"Disappointed that the gluten free pizza crust size changed. It was too small and had to order another one. The wings also changed and we're rubbery. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious and some of our friends has various sandwiches which they raved about. One friend had gluten free pizza and she was not a fan. We had a dog with us but he was not allowed inside the fence of the outside patio, which I thought odd. The service started out great, but then we ran out of drinks and had to wait a bit to receive refills and our checks. The food took quite awhile, but definitely worth the wait. Delicious!!!!!  They also have Coca Cola products which made my husband very happy!"}
{"text":"Beat pizza on Mill, ordered the pizza with everything & it was AMAZING with $3 beers for happy hour. Service was okay, food made up for it."}
{"text":"Just tried your pizza for the first time last night with my family and it was outstanding.  Everything was so fresh and you really get a lot for your buck.  I tried a \"small\" House Pizza (basically a deluxe or supreme pizza) and the reason I put small in quotations is that there was nothing small about the pie I had.  I only ate half of my pizza before I was sufficiently full and needed to get a to go box to take the rest home.  Needless to say I already can't wait to pop the rest of that pizza in the oven to enjoy for lunch or dinner in the next few days.  Planning on telling all my friends and family about you guys.  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their subs. Have tried several, and all are tasty. They have quite a few craft beers on tap so it offers both excellent food and tasty brews. Family friendly and attentive and courteous staff"}
{"text":"Today I had the Magical Mystery Tour pizza. It was unexpectedly good.  The mushrooms and jalapenos were a good mix of flavors along with the pesto sauce.  But it could have used a little more mushrooms considering the price I paid.  I was reluctant to go back since the last time I went I paid over $15 for a build-your-own salad, which came with wilted greens and were stingy with all of the ingredients that you had to add. I was hard pressed to find the mushrooms, avocado (not even a full slice) and olives that I added, basically all the extras besides the wilted greens.  

If you're eating there and ordering pizza be prepared to wait, it's not ideal for a quick lunch. And be prepared to shell out a few dollars.  The food is not cheap! The likelihood of returning to Mellow Mushroom for lunch would be minimal at this point, but I do hear they have good Happy Hour deals.  Maybe I'll see you then."}
{"text":"I really love this place! They have a great pizza and a variety of different ways to enjoy it. They have a nice selection of beers, wine, and mixed drinks. I have been to this location with my husband many times and will definitely return again. The price is about what you would expect for a night out. Service has always been excellent, even with servers who look like stoned hippies (I mean that in the most adoring way possible). I have never had a bad time here. 

The only thing I would say is that this is not the place if you are looking for something outside of pizza and possibly a burger/sandwich. They do not have any \"healthy options\" but that is fine by me we all need a cheat day every once in a while."}
{"text":"The meatball starter is bomb. Pizzas are some of the best... I think it's the crust. They have gluten free too but in my opinion, if you don't have to go gluten free, don't waste the opportunity to have great pizza just to save a few cals. It's kinda like cardboard. Beer selection is really good and the bar staff are educated and can guide your palette. It's typically dead during the day but late night is a bit busier, especially with service industry folk."}
{"text":"Truly awful today at Happy Valley location! We had a party of about 10 today. The bartender was very good and got us our drink orders promptly. But that's where the good service stopped! Everyone's food came out and the orders were all mixed up. My sister ordered a hamburger which was the last plate to show up. It was after about 45 minutes and everybody else was nearly done with their meal. They would show up and check on us and my sister would remind the waiter that her hamburger was still not delivered. After complaining twice, finally the burger showed up and someone in the kitchen had smothered it in salt to where it was not edible! Had to be revenge for the complaints!! We will not return. They were very rude when we complained also! This place SUCKED today!!"}
{"text":"Pizza took 50 mins to get. Came in on my lunch hour. Probably 25 people total in here. Why so long? Took 10 mins for someone to ask what we were drinking. Food was good. Prices are a little high. Not rushing back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Second time we're visiting.  Both times were a disappointment.  My alcoholic drink was so tiny and 98% full of ice.  Two tiny sips and the drink was gone.  If it wasn't sad it would be funny.  
We ordered a medium pizza but by the time we got it we found out the server put it in as a small pizza which wasn't enough for our party nor did we have time to wait for another pizza to be made (we were on our way to a movie).  
Since at our last visit we were disappointed with their basic marina sauce (\"the red sauce\") which was absolutely flavorless we ordered the pesto sauce this time.  It was good.  We topped it with mozzarella and fresh tomatoes.  
The crust was very good this time too.  Last time I was there it was completely burnt on half the pizza.  
Despite not getting enough food for our party and our ridiculously small drinks their only attempt at appeasing us was adding a $5 gift card to our check.  We won't be using it because we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"After my last review I decided to wait a little while before going back. I must say that this time I was VERY pleasantly surprised with the service I received. I sat at the bar this time and the bartenders were very helpful. I am adventurous when it comes to beer, but have a hard time making decisions. The bartenders were able to select multiple beers for me to try. I also had the stuffed portabello mushroom which was amazing. All in all, It was a very good experience. I will be taking my new wife with me the next time I go in."}
{"text":"I want to eat all the Mellow Mushroom.  

The server/bartender was so helpful and friendly.  There was a wide variety of craft beer to choose from. I asked for a jalape√±o cream ale and I was brought a sample to make sure I wanted it since it was spicy. It was spicy and smooth.  

The pizza had an awesome pesto that was so delicious.  All the pizza ingredients seemed so fresh too.  There were so many pizza options, I can't wait to go back and try more of the pizzas."}
{"text":"When you wander in off the street in the middle of the afternoon, it's a pleasure to find a place where you're treated well, the drinks are cold, and the food is good.

Nor was it obvious that it was a pizza place. (That is the only menu item, aside from a few calzone choices.) Fortunately, for the purposes of this review, my wife and I consider pizza as one of the three essential food groups.

We ordered our drinks first, and were well into happy mode when we opened the menu and found the pizza-only offerings. Hey, we're not purists, but maybe a few choices?

We ordered a medium Hawaiian and took a few minutes checking out the decor. The place is well-appointed in muted 60s psychedelic with plaster mushrooms and a painted school bus right out of the Partridge Family.

The waitress kept an eye on our booze, and was prompt in suggesting another round when the glasses got a little low.

The pizza arrived in good time, and I deemed it worthy. The toppings were plentiful and the crust was above average in flavor.

The only food negative was the crust was overdone -- a little too dark on the bottom and around the edge. Which brings us to the next problem; the pizza wasn't cut all the way through. Tear the pieces off by hand. Hot pieces, with cheese.

Wipe your hands and pick up the fork for the first bite. It was the cheap stainless flatware that is so thin, the edge cuts into your hand.

Minor irritants, for sure; but irritants nonetheless.

But by then, physics had taken over and the slice was cool enough to pick up and bite as God intended.

Good Pizza, reasonably priced at $14 to $19 for a 14-inch medium! 

Lots of flavor with lots of topping. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I always get the Italian sandwich and its so good every time. They also have an amazing happy hour with good prices! The only 3 times I've been, our server was Nico randomly, and he's the most patient & kindest guy ever! My sister and I talk SO much and take forever with everything honestly but he's always patient and never rushes us. Great service and food!"}
{"text":"I really like the food at Mellow Mushroom and I can honestly say I've never ordered anything I didn't like.  BUT, the most consistent thing about a Mellow Mushroom, regardless of the state or location is that the service is painfully, exasperatingly BAD!

We visited the Selwyn location about a year ago, and experienced the same bad service typical of other MM locations and never went back.  We headed out to this location at an off time - 3:00 p.m. on a Saturday - hoping that would improve our odds.  Not so.  Despite the place being half full, the three hostesses seemed confused and disoriented.  Lengthy wait for a server, we ordered our drinks and food (knowing you have to seize the opportunity at a MM), and after her departure a second arrived immediately after, confused someone else helped us.  10 to 15 mins go by with no drinks and another server notices us and asks if we've been helped.  Very nice of her to check, but who's running this ship?  Drinks did arrive and the salad and pizzas arrived relatively promptly for a MM.  The woman who set them down (yet another server), said my calzone was still cooking and would be out shortly.  Well, no calzone ever arrived and the rest of my family was almost finished by the time the server made it back.  She had no clue I'd never received my food. I told her I didn't want it anymore, given they were already finished.  She kindly found it in the kitchen, boxed it up and didn't charge us for it.  

So clearly I'm the fool for trying MM again.  I think I've finally learned my lesson.  If I absolutely must have a MM pie, I'll get take out."}
{"text":"Normally a big MM fan, been to a few different locations. Ordered pizza here last night, quite possibly one of the worst pizzas I've ever encountered. Toppings stopped at least 2 inches from edge of crust and were all concentrated in 2 small areas of the pizza. There was literally no sauce at all, almost no cheese and the alleged thin crust was doughy and extremely chewy. I'm giving benefit of the doubt and telling myself this was done by a novice employee who had no idea at all what they were doing but in even in that scenario you'd think someone would be monitoring the finished product. It will be a long time before I visit this location for anything beyond a beer."}
{"text":"The service was just terrible. Sat at the table for over 10 minutes w no waitstaff. I had to go find the hostess and ask for a server. Appetizer did not come out quickly, had to ask for it. Drinks were not refilled. I had to get a water pitcher setting on the bar and fill our drinks. Food was ok. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza anywhere! This is a fun chain offering great local craft beer from each market they are in."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, great happy hour, clean restaurant, great service (Jenna is awesome). Great food too, better wings than bww."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is a great place to go for happy hour drinks. They have reverse happy hour every night. Half off all drinks starting at 10pm! The bartenders and service is great, plus the food is yummy as well. It's a great place to get \"super mellow.\""}
{"text":"Yum-ola. Friendly bartender. Bunches of tvs, free WiFi, great food, and affordable. Enlightened spinach salad, chicken hoagie, meatball Sammie are all fabulouso. I eat tons of food. They serve large portions and fresh food, lots of veggies. I am a happy lean clean-eatin mean lady."}
{"text":"Another great experience.  Only negative comment I didn't find any garlic taste to the parmesian and garlic preyseks."}
{"text":"The gluten free menu is bullshit. My wife has a wheat allergy, but she loved this place when she lived in Atlanta, so we've eaten there because their menu claims to accommodate gluten free eaters.  The first time - no problems.  The second time - she had a respiratory attack three minutes after we left, and while she was driving.  

We were the only customers in the place when we ate, so it's not like they were slammed. 

Incidentially, my order came out wrong too, but its not a health issue for me. 

Never again."}
{"text":"Pretzels, pizza and soda oh my! This place was great even the service. My son loved it and it's hard to please him. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We love Mellow Mushroom pizza and we know that whenever I'm out of town we  always fall back on it for good pizza and beer selection. This visit was no different from the others as far as the quality of the food and beer; top notch, as usual. The problem today was the service. It was absolutely terrible.  We waited 15 minutes just to get the check. It became almost funny watching our waiter joke with his friends at the hostess stand while we waited. The manager didn't find it to funny though and comped our entire meal. She was very apologetic so I informed her that bad service was a theme for this restaurant on Yelp and she said she would try to remedy the problem. 

Food - 4 stars
Waitstaff - 1 star
Management 4 stars"}
{"text":"I normally go during lunch and the food is always fresh. I went tonight to pick up a carry out dinner for the family and the food taste as if it were cooked earlier and warmed up...my pizza was cold and the crust was hard and rubbery...all my wings were hard and dried out as if cooked earlier and re-warmed and sauced. I had to sit and wait on the order so you'd think it would be fresh...not so...very disappointed, had my heart set on this wings. 

Update: Owner messaged me right away and apologized...and sent out a gift card for half of what I spent...all is right in the universe now"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the pizza here however, I have just ordered the appetizer of a pretzel,  they asked me if I wanted a medium or large...thinking I was going to get 1 pretzel I said large. When I received the order I got 6 disgusting funky sized pretzels that were nothing but hard and did not have any dipping sauce other than marinara and ranch this is not the place to go for a pretzel lover."}
{"text":"Good evening Yelpers, this is a live action review of the newest pizza joint on Mill. So far they are batting one star. The waitress didn't show up for 10 minutes and after failing to know what their seasonal draft beers were, her response to a question regarding the house wine was \"I'm not sure, it has a tree on the label.\" Stay tuned.

Update. A few minutes have gone by since we ordered drinks and the waitress comes back not with our drinks but to ask us to remind her what we ordered. Still batting one star. 

First course is up! Never mind, she brought the wrong size salad. Come on Mellow Mushroom! I want you to be good, I really really do.

Pizza has been devoured. Has the service continued to be awful? Absolutely.  Was the pizza good? Yes yes and yes. The meat pizza was as good as it gets. The cosmic karma pizza was delish. The fun guy pizza was the slow kids of the trio but held its own.  The pretzels were meh. 

So the big question is, how many stars did the food recover from the atrocious service?  I'm going with three. Four star food and one star service.

Now to be fair, this place has only been open for a week and most likely just has some kinks to work out.  I will likely return and will most definitely keep this place in mind when thinking of take out.

As you were."}
{"text":"Great selection and awesome specialty pizzas. I never thought I would try shrimp on a pizza but their blue cheese and shrimp pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"These guys can not handle volume. Went here on a weekend and a to go order for two pizzas took 90 minutes. The pizza was good, but there are other pizza places close by that are just as good if not better."}
{"text":"This place was great! Sat at bar and had bartenders pick my beer and food for me. I had a mixed beer, a peppermint bark and white chocolate ale. For food I had the maui wowi pizza. It was all delicious and the atmosphere and service was amazing. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Nice place to chill and grab a couple drinks. Haven't had the pizza. Had the Italian sandwich with potatoes, really good. My girlfriend had a salad (can't recall) but it was delicious. Also this place has good drinks selection and reverse Happy hour everyday. Can't beat the reverse happy hour prices. Will be going back soon."}
{"text":"The decor is fun and interesting for kids.  I appreciate that the kid's menu forces your child to choose between broccoli and apple slices without even giving them an option for fries.  No to-go cups for kids' drinks though, so I wish they weren't included in the meal price because a lot goes to waste.  And no bendy straws either.

Not my favorite place, but the food we had was good.  The biggest negative is that they squished 8 people into a booth, and there was nowhere to put our coats and bags, let alone all the food we ordered.  I feel like some restaurants see a small child and don't count them  towards the number of people in a group, when they should really count as 2 people because you can't put anything hot, sharp, or spill-able within their reach at the table if you want any chance at a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"i have gone to this location twice and enjoy the food and atmosphere! the first experience wasnt the greatest but i decided to give them another chance and it was great, waitress was nice and very attentive. i would recommend"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about here! 

Like any other Mellow location, the decor is funky and fun... I love all the bright colors and psychedelic accents. Restaurant is very big, but sectioned off to make areas a little more cozy or private. We chose indoor seating near a window, but I became envious looking at the patio tables right by the fountain (definitely choosing that next time!!)

I came here on a Monday night, it's was fairly busy (although I didn't have to wait). I would assume it's crazy on the weekends.
 
I ordered the Tempeh Hoagie, which was pretty good. It didn't exactly hit the spot, so in retrospect I would have ordered a pizza.

Server was very sweet and quick to take our order. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Best Wings, Pizza, Happy Hour and Staff in the Valley. Do i need to say anymore. Just go to the bar and get to know Joe, Hyatt and the crew.  Thank me later......"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 or 4 times, and I'm never disappointed. My favorite thing here is their pizza - the Holy Shiitake pie is the best! You kind of have to eat mushrooms at a place called the mellow mushroom. I've also had the Fun Guy pie (5 types of mushrooms if I remember correctly) which I believe is exclusive to their northern Phoenix location. Their wings are average, nothing special. But the pizza is awesome. Also, if you're looking for a good appetizer, try their pretzels!"}
{"text":"Charlotte's best pizza, IMHO.  Not overly expensive either."}
{"text":"We stopped at Mellow Mushroom this afternoon for late lunch/early dinner. The experience was overall very frustrating. The food was 3 stars, but the service was a one star. 

We waited about 10minutes to order, no big deal. Boyfriend created his own sandwich. I wanted pizza -- They let me know that they offer vegan options for pizza. Our server told me if I order the Mega Veggie pizza, they would just make it vegan for no extra cost (no butter on crust, no egg, sub daiya cheese for regular and add tofu). Awesome, right?

We waited for FORTY FIVE minutes for our food -- and we were one of six tables out of at least 30 available. They were slow, yet our server never came by to apologize for the wait or let us know it'd be coming out any minute. 

We finally got our food. Boyfriend enjoyed his sandwich -- my pizza was pretty good. I loved that they use Daiya cheese and not some soy crap. 

We get our check -- his sandwich was $13 (french bread, avocado, salami, pesto mayo, caramelized onions, spring mix) - a little on the pricy side. He enjoyed it, but definitely said it wasn't worth the price.

My 14\" pizza was $19.50 + $3.99 for cheese. They added $4 for my 'vegan' cheese which I did not ask for (had I known, I would've just gotten veggies). I asked our server why this was... she gave me some attitude about how she's new and made a mistake. Didn't apologize -- didn't offer to take it off -- she even mentioned her manager knew she told me the wrong price. Her manager was aware and didn't come by. WHY NOT ASK ME IF I WANT TO PAY AN EXTRA $4 BEFORE PLACING THE ORDER WITH THE KITCHEN? No apologies, no discount and attitude on top of it. Super lame. That was not a $25 pizza. 

Food was okay, definitely not coming back and not recommending this to anyone."}
{"text":"Pitchers of Stella and a 16 inch  Mighty Meaty pizza that was MIGHTY MEATY!  Enough said.  The pizza was delicious...covered in 5 different meats...long wait, but well worth it.  I'll be back...soon!"}
{"text":"We went on a beautiful Saturday afternoon around 1pm. Our server was very sweet and attentive. We ordered the pretzel bites, a couple calzones, a couple kids meals, and a pizza. The food overall was okay. It was nothing to rave about but the environment was nice. Especially with three unruly kids. I would go back if that was a convenient option but I don't think I would crave the food."}
{"text":"This is kind of embarrassing, but I tried Mellow Mushroom about a month ago and really cannot stop thinking about it. I feel like I'm cheating on my usual places but haven't acted on it again. It's more of an emotional affair. 

I think it's because the people at Mellow Mushroom are so nice and accommodating to kids. The waiter we had wasn't of the infamous \"pizza shooters and extreme fajitas\" variety with his flair, but he was most definitely into his job. And that means a lot when you've got a hungry family of four.

I think we had a salad too, but really, I can't stop thinking about the pizza. So much better than I had dreamed it could be. We made some changes to the Kosmic Karma and ended up with a pie with sauce, mozzarella, roma tomatoes, spinach, and pesto. Plus they accidentally gave us a small instead of a medium (which was way enough anyway because we had some pretzel-type app as well) but they made us a whole extra small to take home. So we were enjoying this for days.

The crust is really good. I don't know if I've been brainwashed into thinking that this is really good because there are so few pizzerias that even closely resemble what I grew up on...or whether they has really been a change in my brain, chemically, that now allows this type of midwestern frankenpizza to become enjoyable. Whatever the case: I'll take it. I heart Mellow Mushroom.

Plus? BEER! A lot of beer, on tap. What is wrong with this place? Nothing."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait 40+ minutes for them to make your sandwich. It is clearly understaffed in kitchen.... As this is a problem we've encountered time & time again. I guess we are glutton for punishment.... Because we keep going back every few months in hopes it is better. It never is!!! I've never seen a kitchen operate so slowly!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great ceasar pizza here. Never thought a ceesar salad on a pizza would taste so good."}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The house special pizza is the best in my opinion. Drinks were good and the bartender was great to talk to. I highly recommend this location because it is clean, cool, and funky!"}
{"text":"The pretzel bites are delicious. BUT, be warned. They charge $2 just for the rocks in your drink! WHAT? They should write that on the menu or warn you about it. Cause ice in your water is free. Terrible."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Mellow since its opening, but recently have notified a drastic decrease in the quality of most food items on the menu. I do not mind paying a premium price for premium quality food, which is what I used to get at Mellow, but now I'm paying top dollar for mediocre food and mediocre portions, we used to order the $7 Capri (tomato,mozzarella,basil) and struggle to finish it. Now, it's a joke! They use extremely small tomatoes, quarter size pieces of mozzarella, but still charge $7. The pizza is now hit or miss, when it's on it's still one of the best, but last week we had to send it back twice, once it arrived raw and then was returned burnt. I'm not to the point of swearing them off, but for the price my patience is thin. Get your act together Mellow!"}
{"text":"Good Gluten Free pizza for when we are out with a group. For the price though I would still pick Marco's Pizza over theirs for take out. 
Salads and wings are also good."}
{"text":"The 'shroom does offer a good selection of beers and our house special pie was generously topped. I'd still rate the pizza only slightly above average at a high price. Better part of a fifty dollar bill for a medium and two drafts.

Service continues to be spotty and indifferent. The dishwasher must not be working properly as the flatware was also spotty. And I hate when I have to straighten fork tines...

I'm thinking the best option here is happy hour drafts and appetizers."}
{"text":"Food was yum. Service was even better. We got the food muuuuuch quicker than the other Charlotte locations! Thank you Mikaela and the lovely folks making the food!!"}
{"text":"Great Crust. Long Wait. Too Pricey.

This is how I would describe my visit. My date and I were lucky enough to score seats at the bar on a Saturday night but maybe our first visit should have been during a weekday. Our bartender was quick to take our drink orders but they seemed to be a bit overwhelmed without having a bar back or anyone helping them with stocking/cleaning glasses etc... 

Next came the ordering of pizza. We definitely noticed the prices right away and our first thought was \"this better be some phenomenal pizza\". There are so many pizza places scattered around the West side that are great and don't charge as much. For a small pizza (4 slices) it is $13 but for a medium (6 slices) the price jumps to roughly $20! Yowza! My date and I ordered 2 small pizzas the Philosopher and the Red Skin Potato Pie. We seemed to wait a very long time- longer than most places for our pizzas ( i later found out friends who went there a week prior were told the pizza takes about 45min- I would have appreciated the courtesy of telling us that). The pizza was good and I do have to admit, I thought the dough was outstanding. I found myself liking the crust better than my pizza! 

I can't say I will be back anytime soon but if/when I do visit again I will try just a regular pizza with cheese and pepperoni since the crust is THAT good.

Note: the beers are affordable- about $5 each"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night before a show at Playhouse Square. Seemed like they had one employee for every guest, yet somehow, we got the airhead.  But let's focus on the positive first...


Started with an order of spinach and artichoke dip. Came to the table bubbling!  Not only was it hot, it was very tasty. It didn't have enough croutons for the bowl of dip, and we were never offered more. Did I mention our server was an air head?  

For dinner, we got 2 small calzones. The daughter had the Thai Dye Chicken. It included Thai chicken, cucumbers, and a duck sauce. Who would have ever thought to put that all on a pizza?  

I had the shitakii mushroom pizza and asked for Italian sausage to be added. Got the basic calzone with no sausage. The calzone was very good, with enough cheese that bind you up for a day. But no mushrooms. Did I mention our waitress was an air head?

So on to the server.  She was a soft talker, made a number of mistakes, including challenging me on what beers were on tap (first time in and I knew the draft selection better than she did. ). When we got the bill, I asked if I was Berea my charges for the sausage. She said sorry, but never acknowledged her error. On a positive note, the food came out quickly and the beers were happy hour discounted. ."}
{"text":"Our family really likes Mellow Mushroom. The pizza is delicious and the happy hour prices are unbeatable. I also love their rotating selection of beers on tap. It's nice to be able to try new options and the bartenders are great with recommendations."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection with bartenders that seem a little \"too cool for school\" but service is still pretty good at the bar. Food is solid but one thing REALLY bothers me about this place...

NO FRYER, which means no fries. They take pride in this for some strange reason.

I don't always want fries, but knowing I can't have them makes me want them twice as much."}
{"text":"I'm so happy there's a Mellow Mushroom near central Charlotte again! 

This location is pretty cute. They have the usual hippie-tastic decor coating every inch... there's even a full-sized tye-dyed bus you can eat in (inside the restaurant!)

Mellow will always hold a place in my heart for two reasons: The crust on their pizza pies is hearty (a partial whole wheat mix I believe?) AND they have a huge topping selection! My favorite combinations: 1-Feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes. 2-Jerk tofu and onion.... mmmmm.

Cons:  Weekend evenings at this location are insane, you WILL have to wait to be seated because this place get's packed.  My only other complaint is that the prices are a bit steep.

Pros:   Very good, attentive staff here. Pretty good beer on tap selection. Lots of vegan and vegetarian friendly options, discounted menu after 10pm....

Yep Yelpers, you heard that right! Come to this Mellow after 10pm and you get an awesome deal: Pizza Slices are - $1.50 + 25 cents per topping (50 cents for the fancier ones). This is a great deal!!! The slices are huge.

They also have a late night appetizer deal: Bruschetta, Spinach Artichoke Dip, or Hummus... ALL ONLY $3 each for a full order!  My favorite is the hummus, but all 3 are yummy."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Great prices on drinks! Perfect place to come before you turn up on Mill Ave. There is even a patio for those that need smoke breaks."}
{"text":"I love your pizza but its overpriced. I just can't spring 28.00$ for a medium pizza especially since you charge me 3$ for daiya cheese, by that logic your meatlovers pizza must be 55$ for a medium! Zpizza has the same exact pizza for 19$ after tax, and I could make it (referring to the mega veggie) for about 11$... fix your prices and you'll get a lot more business from me and the people I have revealed the atrocity too!"}
{"text":"Coworker dinner at Mellow Mushroom preceded a work outing to the baseball game & location was perfect.  Our waiter was also *incredibly* efficient & patient w/ our large rowdy group & he alone deserves extra props for our fun evening

Drinkys included Elderflower somethingorother that had bourbon, elderflower & tea - it was pretty okay; cosmos got raves & lots & lots of beers which ranged from tap to bottles & all declared good (even though it was of the Coors & Miller varieties)

Started w/ the Pretzels - these were in reality breadsticks that had been shaped into a pretzel shape.  There was no crispy / chewy outside & soft inside.......but giving credit where it's due, the description of these \"pretzels\" state it's their pizza crust baked up like a pretzel.  

Also shared multiple orders of the Bruschetta & they were the hit of the table - loved the fresh tomatoes

Entrees included salads & different varieties of their pizzas - being the only veggie in the group has its benefits b/c I got to order a whole pie for myself & that choice was the Shiitake Pizza - supposed to have shiitakes, portabellos & different cheeses, all drizzled in truffle oil.  In reality, there were few mushrooms & I didn't really discern *any* shiitakes & no indication of truffle.....but it was a nice mushroom pizza & I liked the ranch they put all over it - yay for the South & how we like our ranch!

Other pizza orders included a standard pepperoni, the Potato Skins Pizza (by far the winner of the table) and the White pizza which had fresh tomatoes & ricotta

Overall = decent pizza - maybe a bit too bready & chewy but wouldn't turn it down if the option presented itself"}
{"text":"The second of three locations in the Valley I've been to. Can't get enough of the \"Shroom.\" This one had great service while dining at the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Beer selection is top notch.  Seating is good and spread out enough to not feel on top of other people.  Pizza is pretty much as custom as you can get.  Sauce, toppings, style.  They probably give you too many options, because I do feel like I don't know how to order just right.  High quality problem though, because I haven't had a bad bite here.  Good spot."}
{"text":"Fun with pizza!!! Mellow Mushroom opened my eyes to the delicious possibilities of different pizza toppings :) This place is pricey but fun to try on special occasions!"}
{"text":"Alright before I commence this review - all should know this : no hate on the food. Food was yummy. Good pizza, thick crust, yadayadayadayada

The whole theme is fresh baked. Well I'll tell you one thing that wasn't baked, and that was me after waiting forever for our pizza that they messed up. I want reimbursement for the goods we wasted before hand to get proper munchies. 

Here's the story. My friends and I all go on a Munchie mission and decide that we should all go to the pizza place, who's theme was being baked. Cool, thanks for that laugh. 

The waitress comes, my friend distinctly says all she wants is a BBQ chicken pizza with pineapple. Ok that's confirmed everything cool. 

Pizza takes some time...

We get the pizza , and it has bacon on it, which typically isn't an issue if I get some bacon, EXCEPT one of my friends dining with us was Muslim, so they could not consume pork. We request a separate piece with no bacon, and were denied. 


So the manager comes out, and what a douche he was. Straight up. Kills everyone's vibes. He doesn't want to fix our pizza, which is just whack.. This isn't a silly dislike or something like that. It's for a legitimate reason. After explaining this, he tried to still have us pay for the pizza, which was not going to happen. After a bit more arguing, he agrees to \"buy\" us the mistake pizza. But not with out five minutes of telling us that he doesn't comp pizzas because he has to pay, and then he can't afford to do that for everyone or he'd be broke. What? You messed up our food!!!! So he doesn't leave us peacefully, he has to put a nail on his own coffin by saying,  \"I'm comping this because I'm religious too\" 
I work in food industry, I've managed 2 shops.  Don't bs me about having to pay for kitchen mistakes. That's illegal, it's production cost. Also, don't sit here and look me in my eyes and tell end that the reason you are buying my pizza is because you are religious. The reason you are taking back my food and making it right is because you manage a food establishment, and your only job is to feed the customer. Not to be a good student of god and buy some college students their pizza. Not stoked on this experience. And to the manager, you should not be managing an establishment with such ignorance. On top of that , I wouldn't recommend writing \"comp\" on the receipt, like you did us some sort of radical favor because you had to remake our food. 


To end on a good note, the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Kosmic Karma + happy hour beer selection = kick ass!  Great pizza and great beer selection for a pizza chain.  The pesto + marinara base pizza was a great match.  The crust 'chew' was on point."}
{"text":"Glad to have a Mellow Mushroom back in the area.  I have been trying to replicate the pizza I love from there at home and you just can't beat their crust, it never turns out as good!  

We decided to be adventurous and try a pie we'd never had, the red potato pie.  It was fantastic!  Who would have thought potatoes would be good on pizza?!  

a world to the wise, the pretzels aren't pretzels, they are pizza dough in the shape of the pretzels, which was disappointing since i'm a huge pretzel fan.  

We ended up so full from the pizza dough pretzels that we each only managed a slice of pizza!  

The beer list was a little weak, but I expect it will get better once they are open longer."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Service was great and nice selection of beers.  The only reason why I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the pizza is definitely on the pricey side.  Almost $30 for a large \"supreme\" type pizza.  Very tasty but the prices sting a little bit."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are great! If you have foursquare on your phone you do get a free soft drink with a check-in!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to find out that a Mellow Mushroom opened up in the Cleveland area! I've been to a few locations while traveling in the South and enjoyed my experience every time. While this location was crowded and the wait was over an hour, it was well worth it. The bayou bleu pizza was fantastic and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes shrimp. The spinach artichoke dip was also a great starter!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see bad reviews. I went to MM for the first time ever. Our server was great and recommended a drink that was awesome. I was the last person to arrive so not sure how long everyone was waiting but my order came out with everyone else's. 

If your looking for a place to meet up with people and have drinks this is a good spot."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the wait.  The wings seemed to be be just warmed up and the pizza was less than average.  The concept is there but the execution on the menu is lacking."}
{"text":"Hands down worst experience ever.

Been here twice. The first time was bad. And the second was the worst. 

The service is absolutely horrible. Our waiter showed disinterest from the start. Was very forgetful. We had to ask for our water to be refilled and only filled 2 cups out of 6. Ridiculous. Bad attitude got worse. Was plain rude when discussing an issue with the bill. And even seemed bothered when we asked what the popular wing sauce flavor was. Normal question. Terrible attitude. NEVER coming back to this place.  Big Al is a big jerk!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place and wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised. The pizza is oddly unique, but in an awesome way! The pretzel appetizer we ordered was also quite good and not like any I have had before. All in all this was a nice dining experience and I would definitely return to this restaurant even though it is a little expensive."}
{"text":"Best happy hour around. Honestly can't beat the price. $3.50 for a craft beer?! Amazing. They have so many beers on tap and the food is soo good. New favorite place! On top of the great food, drinks, and prices, the service is wonderful. I'm writing this just because of the experience we had today with Teanna! We will definitely be back. Great late night place for a drink after work."}
{"text":"very expensive for the quality of the food. spinach dip was fantastic. ordered two different salads and the lettuce was sub par. also the hoagie steak and cheese has absolutely no taste to it ! 
was not impressed, 
also customer service was poor"}
{"text":"This was just ok.  When we first arrived on Sunday afternoon, my hubby and I noticed a \"smell\" (sewage maybe?). We both ignored that little voice that said \"lets leave now\"   So, We sat at the bar.  Service was ok.  
Beer selection AWESOME!  
Pizza was warm at best- definitely not hot when we received it. Hubby had pepperoni and I tired 1/2 shiitake and 1/2 Thai pizza. It was overall just ok. 
Basically, I would come back for the beer but nothing no more."}
{"text":"Am I missing something here? I'm willing to stand corrected if so. The name of this place sounds like something I can buy at Grey Area smoke shop in Amsterdam if you catch my drift. If I could purchase that here then Id understand the draw of his place  - otherwise I'm at a loss. For an overpriced pizza, you can get mounds of cheese, loads of oil, and minimal vegetables. The toppings were not even distributed well  The wings were salty. The service is slow. Unless I'm starving - Id never return here."}
{"text":"This place has a strange name, but the pizza and beer selection was top notch.  We got the buffalo chicken pizza and was very impressed.
The beer selection was great too.  Great selection of Rogue brews on tap.  Big place with a few TVs around the bar."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and have experienced mostly good food and service.  Today we sat at the bar at around 11:10 AM for beers and a pizza.  The bartender was stocking the bar and getting ready for the day. There were only three groups of patrons at the bar (total of 8 people) but the bartender was very passive, even making a comment to one group that they were \"so busy\" - as he tried to figure out how to change the TV station for them (commenting further that he had worked there for six years).  We were never asked how the food was and we had to ask for another beer after our empty glasses sat for quite some time.  Upon leaving we asked for a manager and the bartender said he would try but there was a line for service.  Working in the industry of customer service myself, I was very disappointed and will choose to go elsewhere next time.  It was interesting how vacant the parking lot was considering the \"we are so busy\" comment. Bartender seems like a nice guy and knows about beer but should work on making each customer seem like the only customer that will be in his bar that day."}
{"text":"I got two take out pizzas - the gluten free cheese and regular cheese pizza. My kids love pizza and they literally ate a bite of this pizza and didn't want anymore. I've had lots of gluten free pizzas in town and can honestly say based on my experience this would be the last choice in the future. The service was great. The lady checking me out was super sweet, my pizzas were ready when I came to pick them up. The place looked really cool inside, there were parking spots dedicated for people picking up pizzas. Neither the gluten free or the regular crust pizzas, unfortunately, tasted good - bland, hard crust and little flavor. Other than the food, all else was good!"}
{"text":"Pizza and pretzels are the best thing on the menu! There's a slight sweetness to them. Been disappointed with sandwiches and any other option. Get the beer cheese with the pretzels! The salted or garlic ones are the best. It's a must! Great happy hour mon-fri. Half off all drinks and appetizers. Only way to go!"}
{"text":"By far one of the greatest happy hours in Tempe! I recommend the white chocolate Russian specialty drink, bruschetta, & sweet Thai chili wings. Oh, & the pizza is never disappointing. + great service! Definitely my favorite late night spot to drink and eat versus the rest of Mill ave hangouts."}
{"text":"Well I first gave this place 5 stars, now I've dropped it to 2!!! After our fifth visit, we can tell you service is below average, food is getting worse. Crunchy pretzels! Skimpy on toppings and sauce. Staff is not genuine. Never see a manager. I will think twice before coming back ."}
{"text":"The pizza is only okay. There are lots of better choices around. But the atmosphere is funky and fun."}
{"text":"The mellow mushroom is very good.  The pizzas have a very good crust and the toppings are great.  We went two different  nights.  The first night i had the thai chicken pizza.  It was very good.  The second night i had the bbq chicken pizza.  That was amazing.  The beer selection is very good also.  That is why we went two different nights."}
{"text":"I've been here several times within the last few years and the pizza had always been fabby. 
Why did I give this place 3 stars?
Let's start with the hostess, she wasn't happy to be there, she didn't say hi, didn't  ask how many of us or if we'd ever been there before. I probably shouldn't assume that she could speak or hear. My bad.
Next:  It's not clean. Never has been on  any previous visits nor was it clean today.
I had to brush the crumbs off the table and the booth, but hooray, There was a bonus!!!  Attentive flies. Other customers were shoo'ing the flies away as well which caused the pesky flying maggots to congregate on the windows. I don't know about other people but I hate competing for my food with a fly.
Give the pizza a try, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Thanks for offering vegan and gluten free options. Vegan options include tempeh and tofu, no faux meats. However our service was inadequate. 

We came as a table of four on a Thursday night with what seemed to be only one server for the whole restaurant with the exceptions of a few guys delivering pizza. 
Our server forgot a handful of things we asked for. I ordered a pizza with spinach and pineapple, to be told 20 minutes after ordering there were no pineapple, ok no problem although our server didn't ask me for another option. My boyfriend spoke up and asked if he could get a menu so I could pick something instead, which I chose mushroom. Well, pizza came, no mushroom. 

Thanks for the vegan options.  Consumers will get their money's worth and with more options from a place like Mod."}
{"text":"So I stumbled in here last night at 1 am on a Tuesday completely starving. I needed something to soak up the alcohol so I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza. All they had were slices which was perfect because that's all I wanted. Plus it was reverse happy hour so it kinda defeated the purpose of the pizza but it was totally worth it. I have been here several times and I have to say that I would only recommend coming here on Tuesdays after midnight because it was really chill. You can't get a whole pizza at that time but you can get several slices to plug your gut. The bartender was a little weird. Or I could have just been really tipsy. Either way it was really empty and there was plenty of seating outside. Definitely recommend if you're wasted on Mill ave on a week night."}
{"text":"Had pretty awful service here. Sat for two hours waiting for our food while watching parties be seated, eat, and leave in the meantime. They were also out of our first 3 drink requests (nothing fancy, one request was PBR...). Finally after a loong time, the manager came over to apologize and comped our bill. I'm pretty sure the ticket never made it to the kitchen. Took the pizza to go since we were already there for so long and I have to say we were not impressed with the quality. Maybe it's a place you need to eat super fresh. I would have much rather paid for a meal somewhere else in which would have taken half the time. I will try it again at some point I am sure. It's a shame since I know many people have had much better experiences."}
{"text":"Ordinarily I try to avoid restaurants that make me think of hippies, but I really loved this hip, personal gourmet pizza place!

Visiting from out of town, I found Mellow Mushroom an excellent Friday night dinner spot. Although the atmosphere was lively and there were lots of people there, my group of four was seated immediately upon entering. Our server was very personable and ready to answer all of our questions. We started with a spinach/artichoke dip appetizer (very good) and then had a large pepperoni. The pizza was awesome, I could've eaten the entire thing plus 1/2 of another and made myself sick, and this would've been worth it, but I had the rest of the group to consider.

There's a nice ambience in Mellow Mushroom. There are TVs, but they don't dominate the space. This is my optimal TV condition for casual dining. Furthermore, during my visit, the place had seemed to attract various groups of Arizona's most attractive hipster women, which is a condition that needs its own box on Yelp akin to price and parking."}
{"text":"Great beer..bad advertising. ALL half off after ten is NOT ALL BEERS
I got duped into coming in after ten from there \"ALL BEER HALF OFF AFTER TEN PM\" signs all over the restaurant. I soon came to find out that certain beers are excluded as explained on small print on the menu. Classic bait and switch. Manager was there and completely unapologetic. Good selection but shady practices...customer service is everything"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try this place for breakfast, touting the areas best breakfast, place was not busy, order was taken promptly, however the food was delivered almost 30 minutes later. Considering there was a handful of people in the restaurant. The wait was overly long. Food was delicious and portions were satisfactory. Wait staff friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Our first experience here was good. Courtney was our server, she was very helpful and patient. We ordered way too much but everything was good. The buffalo chicken pizza was our favorite. Happy hour was a bonus, will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner late on a Sunday after arriving in Phoenix. Most kitchens were closing, so we didn't have many choices, but we might have wanted to keep looking. Menu looked good, but food was gummy and bland and service was AWFUL. Do not get the mushroom soup - it tasted like gravy mix. The Italian sub had almost no meat in it. The roasted potatoes that came with the burger were soggy. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here with our 4 year old son and enjoyed ourselves. The atmosphere was very casual and low key it's was a very nice place. The food was good, I feel the pizza sauce could be a little stronger with flavor but overall good. The pretzel with beer cheese was so so so good. We will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars for the food;  4 stars for the service! My mint on the way out was the best part of my meal. 

I don't get why people like the pizza here. We didn't care for it at all. It was very doughy and not enough sauce. It was very expensive - like $19 for a large!

The restaurant itself looked very nice and our server was helpful and gave us good service. 

We won't be back - the pizza just doesn't taste good to us."}
{"text":"Went with a large party after work. The waiter struggled a bit with the order but amazing person and his service made up for the hiccups.
We ordered the pretzel beer balls which was ok; I expected more from the reviews. Also ordered the artichoke dip which was good but I wouldn't recommend it to share.
We got the buffalo chicken pizza- it came with bacon which was good. I would say 7.5/10. I was really looking forward to the pacific rim pizza which unfortunately didn't get to try but my colleagues raves about it. I also had the house special which was also about a 7.5. They have solid chicken wings and I would recommend that for an appetizer. 
Overall good vibes."}
{"text":"Pizza is not very good and the staff lets you sit for long periods with out help. I know a lot of people that like this place but if I am going to have a meal that is not the healthiest then at least I want it to taste pretty outrageous. Will not go here again!"}
{"text":"Came here on a date with my husband...it was our first time in there and we were not impressed at all. The pizza cost about $20 and it wasn't even GOOD! It was blahhhh! C'mon I can understand superb, gourmet pizza costing $20, but that was crap! We won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Great food and service. only 4stars cause of outside patio furniture was horrible and prices."}
{"text":"My Mellow Mushroom experiences started in Florida, so after I moved here I was stoked to see one open in Ahwatukee. This Mellow location is fantastic for happy hour. The bar has indoor / outdoor seating (hallelujah, we are finally in \"sit outside\" weather again), a bazillion beers on tap, fantastic bartenders and happy hour during the week. 

The pizzas are on the high end of the pizza pricing spectrum but they're worth it. Mellow's crust is unique and delicious. Try the Magical Mystery Tour or the Philosopher's Pie. Or just get an appetizer or a Chopped Salad - those are good, too."}
{"text":"I knew it was going to be a weird experience when the nice hostess seated us at the bar in back on a high top table. It was really early, so not sure why that was the first choice. There was barely anyone in the place.
Ordered a Bloody Mary on their Sunday $5 special. 1) it wasn't red. I'm assuming you're using a mix, so it's that watered down? It wasn't even pink 2) the girl rimmed the glass with salt. Is that something new that literally I've never had done to a Bloody Mary? 3) there seemed to be enough alcohol but overall it was gross and I only took a couple sips.
Would have been nice if bartender/server noticed it not being drank and inquired.

Food is good but save your money and do not order mixed drinks."}
{"text":"So I just moved here from Philadelphia, and had never heard of Mellow Mushroom til a native down here recommended we check it out one night. SO DELICIOUS !!!! I was  blown away by how the chefs are able to completely transform even the most basic pizza by adding their special ingrediants and flavor! :) For example, the Mediterranean pizza REALLY tastes like a Gyro! And the Mexican South of the Border Pizza really captures the taste of Mexican cuisine. Every pizza is so dramatically different and unique. There is something for everyone, vegetarians included. I cannot say enough good things about this place, I went there three times last week so that should speak for itself.. Safe to say this is one of my favorite things about the South sofar :) My friends up north are missing out!  If you haven't been here and you live down south.. What are you waiting for? They are everywhere around here, so check them out! Enjoy!"}

{"text":"Breakfast menu has a nice variety, Saturday crowd wasn't busy with no wait. Service was good. I ordered a ice coffee with cream. Very plain nothing special. On the menu I think it says 3.99 for an ice coffee. Finished the first and ordered another thinking it would be free for a refill. Got my check and was charged 2x 5.50 for each plain ice coffee. Asked my waiter see if he could do anything about the coffee. I guess the manager could only change the price to 3.99 like it says on the menu instead of being charged 5.50 for each coffee. Also my omelette was slightly under cooked almost runny on the inside."}
{"text":"By far the BEST happy hour in town, how can you beat 1/2 price beer and apps?  Love the wait staff and probably come here 4-6 times a month!  A great outdoor seating area and great pizza too.  I do wish the appetizer choices were a little more of a variety and would include a few rotating changes ).  But overall the beer selection is fantastic and they do a good job of rotating the taps!"}
{"text":"We were at the art festival today and decided to come in here for lunch. The food was ok. Nothing special. If you want pretzels, don't order theirs. It was just dry pizza dough in the shape of a pretzel. My biggest reason for writing this review was the fact that we ordered 3 kids meals. They came out in scorching hot plates. Seriously this place is lucky that I'm the one that picked up the dish and not one of the small kids. I burnt the shit out of my fingers. We let the waitress know they were that hot and that we aren't warned about it when they were brought to us and she seemed to not really care. No manager came by to apologize or anything. Really bad......we definitely won't be back. And if you get food for your kids, be careful that they don't get burned. I have a huge blister on my finger from touching the dish. Parents beware!!"}
{"text":"This place has a lot going for it. Great beer selection, great food, reasonable prices are all reasons to go. I've been there dozens of times for happy hour.

I will not be going back.

The service has always been sketchy at best, but yesterday's incident was unimaginable.

As a fan of the NFL, I usually go out with a group to watch Thursday Night Football, which is only available on the NFL network (which I don't get at home). Our group arrived at Mellow Mushroom at 4pm, requested to watch the game on one TV and proceeded to have some fun.

After a few beers, apps, and several pizzas, at 6pm the bartender, JOSH KAISER, decided to change the channel on the TV we were watching. He claimed it was \"a homer game\" and proceeded to get very close to my face and say \"this wasn't my house\". I actually felt threatened!

JOSH KAISER is a large individual. After speaking with the \"manager\" about the incident, we decided to leave because he seemed just as intimidated by JOSH KAISER.

I have met the owner, JAY BESKIND, in the City North Mellow Mushroom, and previously commended him on his great establishments. Jay, if you are reading this, please take some corrective action with your staff."}
{"text":"I love the Mellow Mushroom, ever since I visited the one in Denver.  I wish we had one in California.  This place is \"mellow\" with a 60s hippy vibe, and I love the hollowed out tye dyed bus you can sit in.  Don't be fooled by the name, you don't have to get mushrooms on your pizza, the pizzas are not too thick, and not too thin, just perfect size and the crust is super flavorful (a lightly seasoned crust), and not too cheesey or saucy, just a really good pizza.  Oh, and their draft beer list wont disappoint.  It would be nice if there was location in uptown Charlotte.  I'm just visiting without a rental car, and managed to find a way to take a bus out to this location, which is in a nice area, but not easy to accomplish on public transit."}
{"text":"Service was good for us, unlike others who have commented.  They were pretty busy too.  I'm not a big pizza fan, so I had the meatball sandwich with a salad.  The sandwich was average, reasonably priced.  The salad was pretty good.  Other members in my party had pizza.  I tried it, very similar to Pizza Hut.  I thought it was a little expensive for an average pizza place, and not over the top food.

Looks like they have some great $6 lunch specials.  I would return for those, but probably not dinner.

Meatball Sand
Side Salad
Med. 1 topping pizza
2 drinks
with tip $36"}
{"text":"Glad to see mellow mushroom come to the east valley.  Food is good.  Chef salad with Esperanza dressing is the way to go.  Dressing is really good!    We got calzones for dinner..,very good!  Sun dried tomatoes and pepperoni is the way go.  Great beer selection...black market brew left dreamsicle --wow! Service was slow despite restaurant being relatively empty.  Flies everywhere...not sure what can be done to control this but it was noticeably bad.  

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Really good food and customer service! My husband and I came here with our 11 month daughter. Our server, Kaelin, was wonderful. She put in our daughter's order asap and had it out quickly. Our pizza ended up getting burnt so they had to remake it. The manager came out and apologized and offered us the pizza for free as well as any salad while we waited. We thought that was very nice of them to do that. 

We had the Maui Wowie pizza and it was INCREDIBLE! Amazing flavors and perfect crust. We also enjoyed their meatball appetizer. Highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"It only takes one bad visit to give somebody a bad impression.  Well, this location did just that on Saturday, January 27, 2018.  My child and I visited around 1:00 P.M.   The place was not busy and sparsely filled.  We were quickly seated.  For the next ELEVEN minutes, we watched one waiter go to the patio area FIVE times.  We watched a waitress go in the school bus at least THREE times.  All of this happened in the ELEVEN minutes we sat there without a single hello or drink order taken.  We got up and left.  As I passed the guy who sat us, I told him that it would have been nice to even be acknowledged in over ELEVEN minutes.
So, we went to the Ballantyne location.  We were quickly seated and out waiter came by in less than one minute.  According to the Ballantyne manager, upon hearing about our Selwyn location visit, they (same owner of all three Charlotte locations) have a target of 30 seconds to greet a customer.  Well, Selwyn location, epic fail on meeting that goal."}
{"text":"This review is dedicated to the service of this location's catering team! I called them at 11am on Friday, February 2nd unexpectedly needing to feed 25 of my colleagues who were stuck in a training meeting... the catering manager was put on the phone (forgive me, I'm being absent minded and have forgotten her name), and she had 8 pies, and a huge enlighten salad, complete with plates, forks, dressings, trimmings, etc. delivered to our office by NOON!!! The trainees were all absolutely delighted, and not a bite was wasted! The pizza was amazing, as always, but your service in a pinch made my job run smoother!!! Thank you over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"2 things we don't have in California...Waffle House and Mellow Mushroom. When I'm in Phoenix, I go to both. When I'm in Atlanta, I go to both.

I guess I could branch out and order something different but with food, I like to be predictable. Spinach salad and a mushroom & olive calzone. That's all I ever get. What if I don't like the new thing I order? Best stick with what I love.

The service is always great and everyone in this place is super friendly. 

I do have one suggestion for MelMush....GO WEST YOUNG MAN!"}
{"text":"Food was great but service was horrible. Every table that came in after us was done eating before we even got our meals. Server never apologized. Seemed confused when I asked for the check as soon as she brought our food."}
{"text":"Came here last week for my classmate's birthday party.  We had a pretty large group, but they managed to get all of our food out in a reasonable time and even those he arrived later.  I ordered the mega veggie pizza.  I was really surprised at how good the pizza was!  A little pricey for their pizza sizes, so it was great that we could seamlessly use our Groupon deals!  Everyone enjoyed their food.  I would definitely eat here again.  Parking is horrible in this area, so it's great that they validate parking."}
{"text":"Gluten free crust here is amazing! Will seriously come back just to have a gluten free kosmic karma!"}
{"text":"Not super impressed with this place but its not awful either. The drinks were strong, mine maybe a little too strong, but in a college town I'm sure none of you will argue with that right?

Our Stuffed Portabello appetizer just wasn't good. The ingredients didn't seem fresh and the flavor was bland. Not a fan. Our pizza on the other hand was very good and thats why we went there, for pizza. We ordered their vegetarian pizza. Now that I live super close to there and they deliver to the apartments I live in, I may every once in a great while order a pizza to be delivered. Would I ever go inside again? Only if someone else was dragging me there or a group of my friends were meeting there. 

I can see how this place would do well with its location and the students that swarm this area. For a late night drunkin bite to eat, I'd stop here for a slice."}
{"text":"Not only is the food here amazing, but the service is too!! Our waiter Logan was pretty awesome even going above and beyond googling a pizza my husband and I had at a Mellow Mushroom in Alabama called the White Rabbit which unfortunately isn't on the menu here, but hopefully will be added soon. We love this place and highly recommend it, especially for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I've eaten here three times now and tried 3 different things and they were all terrific! The lunch specials during the week are great and inexpensive! The kids meals are terrific too! My picky grandchild loved the meatballs and broccoli."}
{"text":"Slow service and not consistent with other locations. Overall the restaurant is extremely loud if there is any sort of game on.... I would frequent other uptown places over this."}
{"text":"Never been to this location before. The service was ok. The girl was nice and polite. The food was good, but not amazing as I've had at another location. I don't if they do things different, but I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Groovy atmosphere and great pizza! With a retro music lovers vibe I fell in love with their decor. All of their pizzas are made fresh to order! A great thing about this pizza joint is you can split topping on ANY pizza including their specialties. That even means two different sauces. 

I went on the waiters recommendation and orders a small pie( more than enough for one person) splitting it right down the middle with two of their most popular specialties the shitaki mushroom and red skin potato pie! Both were outstanding but I would say the potato prevailed as victor with my taste buds.

The service was top notch. The waiter brought out or pizzas and even before setting down my friends pepperoni pie he apologies for the burnt crust and said a new one was on its way he simply brought it over if we wanted to try and salvage the middle we were more than welcome.

Simply put give this groovy establishment a try. Good people serving good food!"}
{"text":"Been to this location twice. First visit hurt, pizza was very undercooked and service was just ok. We tried again, hey its close by and had luck at other locations. Second visit was better by far. I'd say first visit 1 star, second closer to 4....we came during happy hour, good deals. Wish you had more gf options for apps bc pizza was way better this last time. I did also ask for well done....might have helped."}
{"text":"It was a strange dining experience.  We started out with the pretzel bites with marinara sauce and cheese dip.  Those were good.  They were not salty like pretzels are, but that's good, because I don't like that much salt.  I ordered a Chef Salad without the ham and it came WITH ham.  :(  The waitress didn't come back to check on us for quite a while, so instead of asking for a new salad, we just picked the ham out and my hubby ate salad with ham and I ate the remaining salad without ham.  It was fairly easy to pick the ham out because they don't toss the salad together.  Each ingredient is all clumped together in one spot.  When the waitress came back, we told her about the salad and she apologized and offered to give us a free dessert to make us happy.  We agreed to that.  While eating my salad, I got 2 mosquito bites on my legs.  I can't make this stuff up!  I know mosquitoes love me, but seriously?!  And we were seated indoors!  Next we split a calzone.  We had ordered a \"build your own\" calzone with pineapple, pepperoncinis and fresh basil, which were all listed in the fruit and veggie topping on the menu (not the \"premium\" fruit and veggie topping list).  The calzone came with cheese, pepperoncinis and pineapple on the inside and red sauce and fresh basil on the side.  I thought that was strange.  So we tried to stuff some of the basil in the holes on the top of the calzone so that we could have basil in our calzone.  There was kind of a lot of basil, so I put some of the extra in my salad that I was still working on.  The calzone tasted pretty good, but was rather difficult to cut through.  We had steak knives and I could barely cut through it.  I had to put quite a bit of effort into cutting through the bottom part of the crust.  I don't know if it was burned or what.  It didn't taste burned though.  And speaking of steak knives, my knife was dirty.  Or at least, it had some dried food on it.  Then we got our free dessert (peanut butter cookie) and the bill.  The cookie was free, so that was good.  But the basil was charged at $3.29 instead of $1.69, so I guess they thought it was a premium topping even though their menu listed it as a normal topping.  We didn't want to squabble over a dollar though, so we just paid it.  Still, a very strange dining experience.  I do like that they have a lot of vegetarian options though, and even vegan and gluten free pizzas available. It was a bit cold in the restaurant.  Not terrible, but another diner warned us when we were walking in, that we should go get sweaters because it was so cold in there."}
{"text":"We love mellow mushroom in Denver .. We just moved hear and have been twice it takes way longer then any other mellow mushroom we have ever been some servers are good but some are so slow and don't gives crap I went to lunch with my three kids and it took an hour to get my app ! Will not be going back to this location it's not worth it .... Food is delish but device is horrible"}
{"text":"Love the pizza and pretzel bites here. I've ordered take out several times and just go right in with little wait time. The only complaint I have is that one girl manning the take out line didn't answer the phone for about an hour...so I drove down there and she told me it was too late to order, despite me telling her I'd been calling for an hour. She turned me away!!!"}
{"text":"Ingredients were RAW.  Standard has completely fallen down and overall food including the wings were sub par. Had to wait for another pizza to be made and by that time the rest of the table was finished so it went straight in a box. Manager never came to check on us and nothing was done to please us or compensate us on the poor experience. Shame."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the best pizza I think I've had in Tempe. The House special is amazing and fragrant and the pizzas are always baked to perfection--crispy but not hard, fluffy but not soggy. The crust always makes me want to cry, it tastes so good :') I love Mellow Mushroom! Service is always super nice and upbeat too!"}
{"text":"We eat here all the time because it's an amazing place to eat and the atmosphere is wonderful! My boyfriend and I each got our own personal 10' pizzas and they were amazing! I got the mighty meat with extra bacon and loved it and he got the buffalo chicken and it was so good! Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"I hate hippies but liked this place.  

Surprisingly an awesome selection of beers.  Also a good happy hour with excellent app specials.  Skip Auntie Anne's and try these soft pretzels..  Did not make it to the pizzas yet, but will make like Batman and return."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing, helpful, and respectful staff. Amazing happy hour food, prices, and selection. Amazing wings-can do half and half flavored. Great beers (even though I'm not a beer person). Mellow mushroom is a great addition to the location. Anyone who hasn't been here for happy hour is missing out!"}
{"text":"My inner hippie is so happy that the Mellow is back in Charlotte! I'm still perplexed why they left given the crowd that was there on a Friday night but image they will be staying for years to come. They don't take reservations and the place was packed which made it a bit hard to get a drink at the bar but the service was quick (thank you bartender for scanning my ID for more than five seconds, you don't know how much that boosted my ego). Tons and tons of beer on tap plus beer specials of the day which allowed me to try some I've never heard of before. 

Like other locations, they have the psychedelic bus plus booths, tables and extra big wrap around booths with a backdrop of Woodstock. Service was great but the big dilemma was what to order. I am partial to their Magical Mystery Tour but was thinking about their Kosmic Karma but the Tour yet again won my heart. One o the girls I was with is vegan and they even had options for her--score! The crowd (which I found it amusing that it was packed full of yuppies) seemed to dwindle down around 815P so if you're not looking to wait long, may be a better option to wait a little for dinner. They have a huge patio area which faces Selwyn where you can watch the cars pass or drunkards of Selwyn Pub, I imagine myself coming back in the summer time to enjoy that. All in all, lived up to my expectations and then some of past Mellow visits and looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have gone twice and each time my food has been way expensive and taken way to long to get my food to me, but it's well worth the money and wait! Best pizza I've ever had. It always comes out so crispy so if you don't like yours crispy (like I do) I recommend asking for it not to be. :)"}
{"text":"I like the theme of this location. I was excited they built one closer to me than the one In tempe. I would recommend the kosmic karma pizza!"}
{"text":"If you like good craft beer, delicious pizza and reasonable prices, then check out the Mellow Mushroom. They have a GREAT happy hour and even offer a reverse happy hour starting at 10:00 PM. During happy hour the appetizers are half off AND drinks. Beer. Wine. Spirits. All alcoholic beverages are half off. This place has a great beer selection, and they taste ever better when they are half price. Also, when you offer a beer, the glass will be frozen. You can ask for a room temperature glass if you are a beer snob like me! I've never been upset with this place, and I would dare to say we are regulars!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! The pizza is awesome, the calzones are awesome and the sandwiches are awesome.

Service is generally on top of everything, and the prices are perfect for what you get."}
{"text":"I will call it a 'wow' experience, but only because of the bill @ the end. The cesear pizza salad, was half the size of cpk's version, yet mellow mushroom's cost more ??? I understand they need to make a profit- but that $12.50 personal pizza sized small cesaer pizza salad is outrageously priced.  On the bright side....service was excellent. They have excellent staff, from the hosts to the servers, it was fantastic. If u want to get good customer service, and spend over $55 for 2 beers and two pizzas for 2 people- this is the place. The old Nypd pizza spoiled me. Their prices were much better. If mellow mushroom plans to stay in Ahwatukee for the long term, they may want to revisit their pricing strategy."}
{"text":"man.... Great atmosphere, great beer selection but food needs help.. like idk.. A bit more seasoning or something..  pizza dough needs help, calzones and subs all very bland.. might be back...."}
{"text":"So many vegetarian options - I love it!! They have several vegetarian pizzas with delicious toppings like BBQ tofu, tempeh, avocado, etc.  And many appetizers and sandwiches that are veg-friendly or easily can be made that way.  Apparently they also have vegan pizzas, which I didn't inquire about since I love my cheese... We ordered the Mega Veggie and it was very delicious and most certainly satisfied my pizza craving! The tofu wasn't cooked very well...but I like the fact that that try.

The ambiance/atmosphere was non-existent - The restaurant has a cheap elegant layout (like Cheesecake Factory or Picazzos), but there is hip-hop/urban/skater artwork covering the walls and the menu has a hippie vibe. What? I am not sure what they are going for, but it isn't  working.

This place is pretty pricey for a pizza joint!  We ordered: 1 beer, 1 medium pizza, 1 root beer and the total was $32.  For that price, I could have some nice cocktails with my pizza at The Parlor."}
{"text":"The service horrible, for no apparent reason. There were more employees than tables with customers. I had to ask someone to come take my order and I witnessed a couple tables who left while I was there too since it took so long for a server to come by. The hostess never cracked a smile, except when it was clearly time for her to clock out. It's a shame, when the food finally came it was actually really good. The service  sucked so bad I won't be back though."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place at all. I can make a better looking plate than these guys. I will Not be going there anymore."}
{"text":"Run While you can!!!!  I just left the Mellow Rude Mushroom and I am still upset.  I ate in and then ordered a pizza to go.  I was clearly ordering from the to-go menu that I picked up on way in.  I gave my cc to the server while I was still eating and waiting for  my to-go pizza. I get my BILL and its over $20.00 for a small pizza!!! R U SERIOUS!!!! The 1st pizza we order was not even good!! I'm from a small town in MI with many many Italian Authentic Pizza Palors, I lived in Italy.. I know my pizza, this compairs a frozen pizza. I called the manager over to say I would like cancel my ridicously expensive pizza. I told him that no place under the build your own section does it state that a small cheese pizza starts at 8.99!! Then you pay 1.59 per ingredient.  He was rude, raising his voice at me saying \"you did not grab that menu today, i changed them on Tuesday\" I said yes I did, I picked it up on the way in.. Blake (the GM-sad part of the story they let this guy run the place). He continue to tell me what I didnt do, so I became upset. DON'T tell me that I didnt pick it up.. yes I did!!! I went over by the kitchen to wait for my pizza so they didnt do any damage to it.  I sit there and wait and watch my pizza sit on top of the oven.  He comes over and asked if I need something, I say I'm waiting for my Pizzza.,  He comes back with the one on top of the oven thats been sitting there.( as all the servers stand in the corner doing nothing) I say now you charge me over $20.00 for an extra small pizza, then your rude to me telling what I did and did not do, now you let my to-go pizza just sit. Then he comes over and with a rude tone says, your just made cause I didnt give you anything.  I have been in the service industry for over 15 yrs and still currently am.  This is the Rudest GM I have ever met!!! RUDE RUDE RUDE... I paid 55.00 for a salad, and 2 small pizza.. thats insane!!! there are many other great places to eat in that area.  Save your money and time and the rude GM and go to PF Changs.  If YELP would allow me to put 0 stars I would.."}
{"text":"Had a decent lunch at Mellow Mushroom. Built-to-order chicken sandwich. Didn't come as ordered (they forgot the kalamata olives and side of spicy mustard). Food was kinda bland without these items. Waitress was not not attentive and didn't stay around long enough to be able to report the issues. 

My wife had the Caesar pizza and I had a slice of that. It was very tasty. Overall, I would probably try the place again, but wasn't overly impressed for a first visit."}
{"text":"Came here for late night food.... Not super late but 9ish... We had a coupon for ten dollars off so I figured I'd come here with my friend. Ordered wings and they were great. Probably the best thing here. Meatballs were mediocre. Found cartilage in my meatball. Brownie sundae was sub-mediocre. You may as well have just bought a cosmic brownie from the grocery store and put a bunch of syrup on it. And then top it with ice cream that has had freezer burn for three days. The cinnamon pretzels were a waste of money. The order comes with three and we only ate one. I think the chef was angry and just decided to dump a whole spice bottle of cinnamon on the pretzel. Maybe he thought we were trying to do the cinnamon challenge. I think I might have inhaled some cinnamon when I took a bite of the pretzel and choked. All in all, only come here if you need to get drunk so you won't remember what this horrible food tastes like."}
{"text":"The first time we were here was truly great - this last time was horrid.  I have averaged the two (5 and negative 1) for the star rating, but the lasting impression in my mind is far worse.  This time the service was extremely poor - we sat with empty water, no drinks and no food - only to have over-cooked pizza delivered when we finally got our food.  The kicker was croutons on the salad ordered when we specified that a gluten allergy.  They took the salad off the bill (which is good since we did not get the replacement until we were done) but it did not make up for the poor service or charcoal pizza.  We were so disappointed that we will not be back, even taking into account our first visit (which was great).  I could have gotten over the issue with the salad since everyone makes mistakes, but my husband who actually got to eat, is the most disappointed of all - and described the whole evening as a waste of a dinner out.  Sad."}
{"text":"My wife and I alway eat at the bar there. The bartenders are always very friendly and knowledgable about all of the beers. I enjoy the pizza dough. The food is good. The atmosphere is very good and up beat. I usually have the waiter recommend their personal favorites. I have been pleased so far."}
{"text":"I go for the Orange Blossom beer from local Papago brewery & Iove ALL their pizzas I've ever had here.  Anything Pesto is delish"}

{"text":"mediocre food

worst bartenders i have ever encountered!

there are better places to eat"}
{"text":"I was actually quite impressed by the pizza here. I believe what stands out is the freshly baked pizza dough- the right \"crispyness\" with a nice soft fluff in the crust. Once of the few pizza places I would consider returning to. The cheese and sauce is whatevers but the crust is what stands out here. A perfect and somewhat classy sit-down place to go after you're nine drinks in from mill ave."}
{"text":"The servers are awesome.  Very, very nice and friendly! Best customer service I've had in a very long time, ask for Maverick.  Will definitely be coming back!

lost a star only because I'm hoping for more mushroom soup with the togo orders. It is so good that not having enough; is worth a star. 

:p"}
{"text":"Skip the appetizers and salad...pizza is some of the best. Great seasonal beer selection.  Can be $$$ but if you stick to pizza and a beer you'll be pleasantly satisfied."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick lunch on a snowy April day. Great experience. Conversation and service from Amber (working the bar). Had pretzels and bruschetta apps, very tasty. Created our own pizza and it didn't disappoint. Fresh ingredients and delicious. Wish we lived closer, but we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Went a few months ago for lunch date, was so great we wanted to take kids. Do not go on a Saturday night! Why would you have 2 servers for entire place & 1 also is bartender so super busy. We waited so long for our appetizers & had few drinks by the time we actually had dunner in front of us I just wanted to leave. I will never go back. From reading other posts looks normal for lack of staff. It was horrible you would think with two they could remember but made it worse. Both just forgot what they were getting. Food tasted good although not all was hot & we all did not receive our food together. Veey sad since I have budget we only go out as family to dinner once every few months so thanks for horrible experience the 1 star was for trying with food."}
{"text":"I would love to give this location 5 stars but repeated errors and poor service have dropped my rating. We've been coming here for 3 years and the food is always amazing. Get the Maui waui pizza. It's the best. 3 years ago the service was great, attentive and friendly. Lately it hasn't been that way. Unfortunately our food has been burnt several times or the the bartender has forgotten our food on multiple occasions and we've been served cold food. Isn't there a food runner or a manager watching the expo line to ensure food gets out in a timely manner? Another time we had a server that would come by to check on us, we'd tell her we were ready to order and she promptly walk away. We love the pizzas and pretzels and want to come back more frequently but the service is making us think twice.

Just wanted to update our review. The food is amazing and we really enjoy Alexis. If you're looking for a great pizza or fun selection of beer, this is the place."}
{"text":"Awesome place for happy hour and reverse happy hour! The beers are always changing and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable! They always walk me through the types of food and drinks that will go with my taste and pairing. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Post mates delivery is awesome!!!!

I got the pizza I wanted just the way I like it!!! Yum! 

Ordered cheese pizza - olive oil garlic base, x cheese, & red potatoes. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience! Walked in on a Wednesday at 6:45PM and was seated right away. Took a little long for drinks. We placed a food order at about 6:55. The salad and pretzel bites (not pretzels but balls of pizza crust) and salad came out 15 min later. During this time we never saw the server once. Another guy had to come bring us drinks and something to eat with. We then sat for an additional 45 min for 2 calzones! It was only after we complained and asked for are food to just be boxed up so we could leave did we even see the server. The calzones finally came not boxed up but brought to our table with boxed for us to do ourselves. The calzones looked disgusting with grease dripping off the plate and so doughy it could be easily folded in half to fit in the box. (when we got it home to eat we took two bites and threw it in the trash) very disappointing. Total waste of time and the 50.00 spent on the meal. During the 45 min we sat for a calzone we watched 2 tables get up and walk out. Needless to say we will not be returning or recommending this location to anyone."}
{"text":"We had the truffle mushroom pizza... it was decent pizza in flavor the BEST was their crust for sure, but come on... pricing is a bit steep more like 3 $$$"}
{"text":"First off, please be sure to pick up the key word in many of the reviews ... \"expensive\"!!!

We ordered a large (16 inch) Kosmic Karma pizza which has feta, spinach, sun dried tomatoes and fresh tomatoes.  Two sauces are on it - both the red and also pesto.  We decided to add a protein and chose chicken on it.  I'll be honest with you.  I could not taste any feta.  I have no idea if there was spinach on it and the sun dried tomatoes are on about 2 pieces.  The chicken consisted of very, very few 1/4 inch chicken dices.  The fare ... $25 for the pizza and a $5 add on for the chicken.  This was a $30 pizza.  This was wrong on all accounts!  We took home 2 left over pieces so I plan on trying to see if I see any green (spinach) on it or feta or sundried tomatoes.

$30 for that was highway robbery!  My opinion of the dough was that is virtually tasteless.  The pizza is not N.Y. thin nor is it thick either.  I'd say it's right in the middle hovering on the thinner side.

I also had a bowl of their house soup - mushroom of course, for $5.  It was fair and I am a major fan of mushrooms.  Certainly far from great and a soup that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.

Did they have service problems ... yes.  That I am NOT taking off considering the place is in it's first three week's of existence.  After this thrilling pizza, we decided to try the cinnamon pretzels for dessert at our daughter's recommendation.  Order was placed as we were finishing the pizza and after I called our credit card company to see if I have the credit limit available to pay this steep stipend.  We waited a good half hour.  We caught our server and he said there was a problem.  He asked if the manager came over to explain.  Nope, that never happened.  We waited 10 minutes more.  The manager came over and explained there was a problem and they will comp. the pretzels.  The manager will bring them right out.  10 more minutes went by.  We caught the server.  By now my wife is dying to know how long it takes to fire up pretzels.  The server said they JUST went into the over and they will be out in 10 minutes.  We told the server that we were sorry because he is unable to turn this table.  10 minutes later the server, not the manager as he was too busy putting out many other server/food issues, gave us the pretzels - basically their tasteless dough in the shape of a pretzel with cinnamon sprinkled on it with a side of honey for dipping.  It was \"meh\".

Do I have anything positive to say?  Yeh, the d√©cor is good.  Like other reviews say it's a hippie's motif with front windows that will open up like garage doors come the warm weather into a small patio on Detroit Road.  That will be popular.

Also, the beer list was good with about 20+ taps and a full page of bottles (most drafts and bottles were around $5).

The menu had other options (appetizers, salads, calzones and subs) that sounded very good.

However based on this experience, it will likely be a very, very long time before we step foot in there again! 

Trust me, it's below average food priced quite high (did I mention that pizza cost $30!!!).  For similar type unique, snazzy pizzas Dewey's blows this out of the water.  I'm sure the owners of this franchise (we were told are Rocky River residents) feel they can charge very expensively and the Rocky River residents will come out in droves to support it.  So far it's working because the large space is packed.  However for us, we won't be back."}
{"text":"It is what it is with this Mellow Mush :-)
I first tried this place in 2013 when we first settled into Charlotte. If I'd reviewed then I would've given a 4 1/2 star rating. Since this initial visit the subsequent visits changed my perspective on this place especially in the realm of service.

The greeters are just not that into their jobs anymore. It's like pulling teeth with no novocaine to have them smile and appear happy about being at work and your visit which helps them stay employed (business ).

The food on the other hand is still tasty, also pies can get a bit pricey when choosing your own toppings so be sure to look over the specialty pies as you might see one with all you want and then some. They don't charge you to remove items from the specialty pie, I say go for them because they have a set price. We've ended up paying like double for a build your own when there was a specialty that had the ingredients (of course the server didn't inform us to help save us money :-(

The gluten free pies are the only item we've had that we didn't like AT ALL. gluten free doesn't mean TASTELESS but here it DOES :-(

Our favorite part of going here besides the food were the game tables upstairs which are no longer :-("}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite restaurant. The happy hour is great, great selection of beers. Service has been excellent every time I been here. Decent selectionof gluten free food and gluten removed beers. food is presented beautifully. Restrooms and dining room are always clean as far as I can tell. This location seems especially well staffed. If I could give it 4.25 or 4.5 stars I would, but my qualm is with being served room temperature food way too often. I worked in restaurants for 7 years. Very unprofessional to serve cold food. The servers seem too busy to replace it and once replaced cold beer cheese with cold beer cheese for my barely acceptable cold pretzel bites. I also received soup that was a little too old for my liking looked like it cooled  down too slow the night before and the roux was a little clumpy still. Could have blended and finished with cream or something. Maybe the sections are 1 table too big on Friday and Saturday nights?"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and cool atmosphere! It is a bit pricey but I'd recommend it of you are looking for something different.  Service can be a bit slow.n"}
{"text":"Hello my friendly peeps, Friday evening I was at Mellow Mushroom for their great happy hour ! I say great because the drink specials and prices rocked ! Sadly, for me the appetizers were mediocre .  FYI if you go get there early , by 5pm after 5 you will be waiting 45 minutes to an hour ! This place is screaming busy , and the energy is high you will have a great time.If you go let me know what you think . Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Pizza was good, I built my own with kalamata olives,  sundried tomatoes and feta.   The cheese they use is really good.   Wide selection of beers as well.   Prices are kind of high though."}
{"text":"How can a place with such a great location and good food perform so bad. Last night a group of 4 of us entered around 930. We were sat at a bar table by a hostess. I got up and used the restroom. After my return and an additional 5 minutes of not being spoken to my the many waitstaff wandering around we left. I love their food but this was my last attempt here."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers, although they run out quickly on the better ones. Our favorite bartender is Joe, he is always on top of his shit and is very friendly. We have been coming to this location for about a year now, and even when we move out of the area we will come back because of Joe.

Food is mostly pizza and bar-type food, but they have some great appetizers, or munchies as they call them. The reverse happy hour doesn't start till 10 pm, but it offers half off munchies and beer, and maybe their hard alcohol too. 

Not sure how other locations are, as we have only been to this one and the Norterra one, but we will always head into one if we are in that area. Good place, great beers!"}
{"text":"My mom and I had never been and were impressed with the friendly service and good food. Not your traditional pizza experience, but great! Loved the philosophers pie! The decor was different than we expected, but that added a little fun to the experience!"}
{"text":"This place is kind of an anomaly for me.  From the name it doesn't seem like it would be as nice inside as it is.  The decor is modern and cool and the service seems to be pretty good.  The wait staff there have been very helpful and nice.  I have been with my niece and nephew both times and they had a good time and like the food a lot.  I always get the house calzone.  It's pretty good the only complaint is they only give you a tiny bit of sauce so just ask for extra when you order.

Try
  - House calzone"}
{"text":"Pizza selection was awesome - had Mighty Meat pizza and Pineapple and Ham pizza - there is a great selection if draft beers that would make any beer lover want to return on the near future.  Took the grandchildren who were entirely entertained with the built-in touch screen computers on the table. Each of the children were able to play separate games on a single  a screen. Table service was excellent a very congenial and energetic staff. We would definitely re-visit when I return to the area on Ballantyne."}
{"text":"OK - updating review.  I discovered soon after I wrote my initial review that MM is strictly an eat-in restaurant for us.  I ordered a medium pizza & meatball app to go.  He said 25 minutes.  25 minutes later I arrive and he checks on my meal.  \"3 more minutes in the oven,\" he says.  Ok, great.  Pizza will be piping hot.  We live 5 minutes away.  By the time I got home, the meatballs were hard as rocks and inedible.  The pizza was lukewarm to cool.  Was definitely NOT right out of the oven and in fact seemed to have been sitting there awhile. 

The crust and pizza is so stellar at Mellow Mushroom.  The steam inside the pizza box ruins the crust and turns the pizza rubbery.  

I still give eating in 5 stars....2 for takeout.  Solid 3 overall."}
{"text":"The place has some very interesting pizzas!  The bartender/server was very helpful. We were told we could do 2 halves of different pizzas if we couldn't decide what we wanted.    We had the mellowterian and red potatoe pizza.  

Pizza was very tasty. The red potatoe was better in my opinion.  But both very good. I'll be back to try some others. 

Service was good!"}
{"text":"Just went to MM tonight to celebrate my sons 17th birthday
Service was good
Ambience was good
Food was good/fair
While I get the laid back/hippie feel...
One thing that I would point out is do you work here or not?
There was a guy that looked like he was heading to Home Depot to get mulch on a Saturday mourning.
Or maybe he just left got back from the swap meet  after a long day.
Dirty looking hat
Baggy shorts, to go with his old looking  T-Shirt... For 100 bucks you could not tell if he was heading to do yard work or to McDonalds for lunch.
Once again I get the Melllllow
But come on, let your kids wear what they want...but no apron...no standards at all???
I believe you owe your paying customers more than that.
Funny thing I asked to speak with a manager just to point it out...
Tall skinny girl, she says oh we dress casual in mellow mushroom shirts...
I looked at her and said what about you....
Long duhhh... Oh I don't have one on...lol
What a Captain to that Ship
Anyway...wonder if the owners knows how loooose things are really run...
Beer out the back is next(if not already)
Good luck....
Oh yea where do you keep the Air filters?

{"text":"Good food.  A little overpriced.  Service was ok a little obnoxious but better than unattentive."}
{"text":"I don't even want to give one star--is there a zero star option??
We have eaten at this Mellow Mushroom at least 10 times since they have opened and but service has always been mediocre.  One of the reasons that we kept coming back is because we kept getting manager comped meals due to a variety of issues this location had.  
Tonight we went in for drinks and reverse happy hour after a birthday party at the establishment next door.  There was a group of 20 of us there and after eating a full meal, and sitting there for 2 hours- I had drank ONE drink when I went to order another drink was told that our entire party was cut off from drinks.  Excuse me?? When I asked why exactly that was the bartender/manager on duty sarcastically and rudely said \"would you like me to call you a cab home?\" and walked away.  With zero explanation and a cocky bartender on his high horse thank you very much but I will never come back to this establishment again.  At 11:30 at night on a Friday night I am not sure what sort of crowd you are expecting but I do not expect to be cut off after one drink. This place promotes their variety of beers on tap and is a BAR.  The service is horrible and if you want drinks/food there are plenty of other choice in the area do do not go to the City North Mellow Mushroom. I highly recommend Modern Margarita or Kona Grill right next door!"}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere. Yeah,  it's a little cheesy, but being a pizza place that's acceptable. And it will NEVER be as cheesy as that joke. eDAM that's gouda.

We came on a warm night and sat outside listening to the roar of Selwyn Avenue. Awww, romantic. It was great though. We'd had a few glasses of wine at Petite Phillipe next door and the psychedelic school bus was just what we needed.

Our server was harried but competent, and the pizza delicious. I'll never call a pizza a \"pie,\" by the way. And neither should you. That name is bad and you should feel bad."}
{"text":"The bad just keeps getting worse.  My previous review for Mellow Mushroom garnered two of five stars; they've officially been downgraded.

Today was my third and final visit to the the Mushroom.  Having been several months since visiting, and with my initial two visits occurring very near to their opening, I thought to give them one last shot.

Entered at what I would consider a peak lunch time (between noon and 1pm) and it was actually quite dead.  There was a managerial type person standing near the podium that was engrossed in their cell-phone.  At our approach, they quickly stepped out of the way and a hostess stepped in to greet and seat us.  Okay thus far (still don't care for their retro, 80's, skater decor -- it seems really contrived).  

Server was friendly enough.  She took our order and brought us our drinks (waters, all around).  The food took quite some time to arrive; it was explained at one point that they were waiting on my 10\" pizza.  Fair enough.  Somewhere in here, I tired quickly of the tap-water offering and asked instead for a Diet Coke.  

The food finally arrived and everything *looked* okay.  I ordered five jerk chicken wings, well done and a pepperoni and sausage pizza.  My friend ordered what was supposed to be a chicken club \"hoagie\", however it arrived on thickly sliced bread (i.e., not a hoagie).  First thing I tried was the chicken wings.  They were seasoned nicely and cooked well enough, however they had *obviously* been cooked well in advance of the pizza as they were room-temperature to cold.  I made it through two of them before setting them aside.  

About this time, my friend noted that her sandwich was incredibly dry -- so much so that the crust on the bread was almost \"sharp\" and causing a scratching sensation when eating.  She also noted that it was quite bland and possibly \"the worst sandwich I've ever had\".  

The pizza was sufferable, if not overly cheesy.  It was obvious that little care had gone into the making of the pizza, as the toppings were strewn mostly to one side of the pie, leaving one half to be mostly cheese and... well, cheese.

At this point, I asked for a box to take the remainder of the pizza home and requested that the wings be removed from our bill as they had clearly been fired too early and were not acceptable.  The server looked at me critically, stating that she would see what she could do, at which time I informed her that if she can't do anything about it, to please send her manager over so that I can resolve it with them.  Needless to say, the wings were removed.  If it's any indication as to how bad the food here is, I didn't even finish a single glass of Diet Coke -- even it had a foul taint to it. 

We left feeling anything but Mellow."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. But it seems to have taken a few steps back. I ALWAYS order Spinach Artichoke dip (with garlic toast points) but I've noticed the past few times we've gone that there is less. Less dip AND less bread. 3 times now. This last visit, it was served at room temp. And the bread was almost chewy. So not up to par. I dont like the cheap looking menus. The older ones were better. And no more Kilt Lifter. Boo. It is always noisy so not exactly family friendly anymore. I'm sad as this used to be one of My favorite places!"}
{"text":"Great spot!!! The buffalo chicken pie is delish!!! The service was great and the free humus for checking in will now be one of my staples when I eat here."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good.  

The beer selection is excellent, worth a trip to taste a nice variety of flavors.  

We go during the afternoon on weekends, not too crowded and good place to watch some football or whatever sport is on that season."}
{"text":"A-OK is what it says, so that's not bad, but it is not good.  My only beef is the price of the pizza.  The pizzas are delicious, but goodness gracious they are a bit deep in the pocket.  Although they are topped with quality fresh produce with a unique variety of combinations.  Therefore, it makes sense, and I get it.

Even though I am Filipino and have tasted all kinds of cultural foods, there is nothing better and easy than a delicious, perfect dough, melted mozzarella with unique toppings on top of a creamy sauce pizza.  It is one of the main attractions in the Norterra and Happy Valley area, and I am glad it is there.  They have an assortment of beers, and it is a great place to hang out.  However, we cannot go there all the time, even though I would love to (too pricey for pizza, but that's me).

My wife and I will be back again because you are just right around the corner!  Oh, pizza, how you delight me."}
{"text":"Very good! We got half Maui Wowi and half Potato pizza. Honestly the potato was better, would definitely order it again."}
{"text":"Nikki is the absolute best bartender ever. She's usually there mornings and I will make the drive from anywhere in the valley to come see her for lunch. She has experience managing a few sports bars over the last 15 years + and she's an absolute angel. Bright, cheerful and genuine. If she's working, go see her for the best service."}
{"text":"Meh. This had pluses and minuses. Plus - the beer menu was fantastic. Minus - they poured my Dogfishhead 90 minute IPA (expensive, tasty) into a hot glass. So, nasty warm expensive beer. Thanks, new bartenders! I will say they gave me a new, cold glass to pour it into, which helped. As soon as I started telling the server what happened, she finished my sentence - guess that happens a lot. But really, what bartender worth their salt does that? Side note, happy hour is only till 6 (instead of 7 like most places). So when you're off around 5, like most of us, then head over, you have maybe half an hour. Which is lame. Next, the food. Ordered the pretzels, which, per the menu, are made from the pizza dough. They are not, however. They are made from wheat flour. Which is fine, but for the fact that it was not indicated. So, surprise! Doughy, crunchy, brown, extremely bland pretzels. I could smell garlic, but surely could not taste it. Meh!!!! I decided at that point not to order any food - I was unimpressed. However my husband texted and asked if I could bring him a salad. So I braved it. No bueno. They have 2 sizes/prices of salads, so I thought the expensive one would be large. Having learned from the pretzel escapade, however, I specifically asked whether the large would be enough for two, and was given an emphatic YES! It's more than enough! So I did a \"build your own\" salad. Plus - You can create your own salad as desired! Minus- It's TINY! And every topping is individual. Which would be ok if it were slathered with toppings, but it's not. Got mushrooms - for $1 - and there were (quite literally, I counted) six slices of mushroom. Which I'm almost sure is not even a whole mushroom. For $1!!! Also ordered bleu cheese crumbles, at a whopping $2.50, and had - no joke - two tiny balls of bleu cheese. All told the salad cost $13 ($13!!!) and was subpar. All on all, I was angry with myself for stopping here. The bartenders didn't know what they were doing, the food blew, and it was packed with screaming children. I will note, however, in addition to the excellent beer menu, we had a great server. That's why they got the second star."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Love the selection of different pies. Service is somewhat slow but overall great place. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints no matter what Mellow Mushroom I end up at.  I got the Thai dye pizza and it was great.  One of the freshest pizza's I've tasted in a long while.  Service is quick and nice! It's like most chain restaurants but the food here is hella good :3"}
{"text":"Gave us the wrong drink, took three times to ask for ranch for pizza, barely any toppings on pizza, never checked on us, and food took too long to come out."}
{"text":"Waited 10+ minutes for service after being seated, then left. During that time our waitress made 6 trips to a single large group--drinks, food, more drinks, more food. Frustrating. Never even gave us a glance so that we could get her attention.
We will give the place another try in the future; looks great inside and would probably be fun if the service is up to expectations."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment decision to stop in for a sausage pizza to go.  Regrettably.

I wish I had ordered the pretzels/wings that looked yummy as I walked pass some patrons seemingly enjoying them at the bar.

Here's a pizza baking 101 clue for the kitchen:  Get and use an oven scraper!   The burned flour on the bottom of my pie rendered it inedible.  Had I not driven home to dine, I'd have asked for a refund or a redo on a clean stone.  Considering the variety of pizza restaurants in the area- just reading some excellent Zesty Zzeeks reviews- my $20 could have been way better spent."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. Nothing stands out. It's just blah. The service is HORRIBLE every time. It's laughable, really. Our waitress brought our food out all at separate times, never checked on us, never smiled, rang in our order wrong, and never brought us the things we needed and requested."}
{"text":"Unprofessional workers who forgot to put in our order after telling us to pick up our pizza in 45 minutes. After telling us that they would rush our order and get it done in 20 minutes, it took another 35 minutes to get the pizza. Of course the order was not right. Very unorganized."}
{"text":"A lot has changed at this location.  The service was pretty good but the facility looked pretty rough.  Walking up to front every chair at every table on the patio was pulled out and not straight with tables.  So bad that I took a moment to fix this before entering.  Food remnants on the ground and trash under tables.  Host stand had employee drinks sitting on counter top.  Table beside ours sat dirty the entire time we were there for lunch.  None of the old bartenders were there that we used to see.  It was enough that I will likely not return with other options out there."}
{"text":"For my first visit, my friend (who has to eat Gluten Free) and I sat on the patio. The weather was great but I wish I had been face to face with something other than a row of cars. There aren't enough garden restaurants in Phoenix, IMHO. We were seated immediately and after a few moments I had a waited at my table. It was Happy Hour - 1/2 price drinks and Munchies - so I asked for what they had in wine and it was limited to the house brand of each variety for $5/ glass normally but $2.50 for HH. I ordered the Pinot Noir and the stuffed portobello mushroom after the waiter suggested that it could be gluten free with the balsamic dressing on the side. The mushroom was decent sized and delicious. Per the menu, a Portobello mushroom cap stuffed with artichoke hearts, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and mozzarella. Baked and drizzled with a balsamic glaze. Served on a bed of spring mix tossed with an herb vinaigrette dressing. It was moist, savory and flavorful and at $9+ normally, HH was a steal at less than $5.

I also ordered twice backed chicken wings mild. They came out after the mushroom and although I really liked the taste, I thought they were small. Maybe this is because breaded and deep fried wings are likely bulkier and make them seem bigger (shrug). Either way, we enjoyed them. 

For the main entree, she ordered a gluten free pizza and enjoyed it. She said that the recent change in the gluten free crust was a good one and that it had improved from her previous visit.

I had a small Thai Dye (Olive oil and garlic base, all natural grilled curry chicken, mozzarella cheese, Roma tomatoes, onions. Topped with fresh basil, cucumbers and a sweet swirl of Thai chili sauce.) at the recommendation of the waiter and really appreciated the unique toppings. The cucumbers were the perfect refreshing topping to the spicy sweet sauce. I ended up taking half the pizza home for lunch the next day and enjoyed it cold too!

Overall, I was impressed and will be back to try the Holy Shittake Pizza next."}
{"text":"This review is for the bar,beer & service only. I WANTED to like this place, I really did. A co-worker and I stopped by here after work the other night. First off, I felt like I was a huge incovnenience ordering a beer from the bartender. She was busy, but not \"I am entitled to be a total b**ch because I am off the charts busy\". We finished one beer and she took away our glasses. Uhhh, how about asking if we want another one? She came back 5 mins later and then asked. Weird....

Decent beer selection. You can smoke on the patio and the smell drifted inside which to me, a non-smoker, was off-putting.

Will try this place again to see what the pizza is like as I'm all for second chances. Maybe the bartender was just having an off night."}
{"text":"The people that work here are great, and the food is awesome as usual. However, they have the patio garage type doors open, and the smoke from peoples cigarettes comes billowing in the place. It smells like shit, when you're trying to enjoy your meal. The smoke smell ruins everything. Makes you sick to your fucking stomach. 

P.S. I'm a smoker too! 

But who wants to enjoy a nice meal with fucking smoke billowing in your god damned face?"}
{"text":"So glad Mellow Mushroom is back in the QC....
My previous experiences with MM have been in Asheville and Knoxville, so I was a little disappointed,  when I moved to Charlotte a few years ago, to find out all the 'Shrooms in Charlotte had closed.  
Today we sat on the patio, it was 83 degrees, and had a blast! The service was good, but if you've been to any of the other 'Shrooms, this service was quick and gracious in comparison. The pizza is always good and the beer menu is better than average. My Dirty Hippy (Guiness and Sweetwater 420) was delicious! Great location... diagonal from Selwyn Ave. Pub... lends itself to the neighborhood feel. Overall, I was very happy with this visit and I look forward to a Dirty Dog!"}
{"text":"I love pizza. Though it's usually hard to disappoint me, some places do, but I know I can always count on Mellow Mushroom. Starting my love affair in college, I was very excited when they opened this uptown location. Too excited. 

Ironically, my gym is on the same block so I run by it frequently but do my best to only go around once a month. (There IS such a thing as too much pizza). Anyway, I've always been pleased with the meals I have had at this location. It's usually very timely and cooked perfectly. I love the original plain jane pepperoni but their specialty pies are always on point! The staff is a occasionally on the lackadaisical side but I'm in a place with 'shrooms on the wall sooo....yeah. 

They also have some great happy hour specials (one Thursday, all NC beers were just $3). The parking situation isn't ideal and once the construction is complete, hopefully this location will be as great as the rest!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza I have had in Phoenix! They make their dough with molasses so it is perfectly gooey while also perfectly crispy! Their soft pretzels with the beer cheese are to die for, and I love the buffalo chicken pizza, and the red skin potato pizza... ADD SAUSAGE. a little pricey, but definitely a good place to splurge!"}
{"text":"I have frequented many different Mellow Mushrooms and have never had a bad experience until last night. We were excited to come as we had family visiting from New York and this is usually one of our favorite places! We arrived yesterday, a Monday- at around 5pm. It wasn't busy as it was still so early. A hostess was at the stand with about three other people. I told him I needed seating for 4 adults and two children. He went to go set up the table I'm assuming for what felt like quite a long time. During that time another person even came and tried to seat us. Finally we were brought to our table and after sitting there for 15 minutes I decided to go see if a waitress or waiter was even assigned to us. I walked back to the hostess stand but no one was there, it looked like half of the staff was congregated at an empty booth on the left side of the restaurant. I walked over to ask the hostess if we had a server to which he replied \"yes you should.\" He left the group to go find someone and about ten minutes later our waitress came. She was extremely apologetic and sweet and was not one of the many staff who were standing around. She was very attentive for the rest of outer visit. The pizza was just ok, definitely not the best we've ever had. My question is where is the management? It doesn't look good to your customers to have ten staff members standing around talking while meanwhile they are sitting in a booth for 15 minutes not even being asked if they would like a drink. I also noticed two tables had customers leave and dirty dishes were just sitting on the tables for 30+ minutes... Every other Mellow Mushroom has had a very hands on manager on who walks the floor and takes pride in the establishment. Definitely didn't see that here. I would visit another location before dining here again."}
{"text":"I eat at the Uptown location at least once a week, it's take out so usually no issues. Today is my first time at the Ballantyne location. We called in the  order, on the phone she said it would be 30 minutes, get there still going to take 30 minutes. Not sure how that works but ok. We decided to sit at the bar for a drink to wait, sit down, not noticed. Two other men sit down and someone asked them if they've been helped and says absolutely nothing to us. We get up and walk away after 5 more minutes. First and Last time here."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this place, so when a Groupon came out, I was on it! My husband and I went on a Friday night at about 5:30 pm and it was pretty empty, but filled up quickly while we were there.

After a hostess seated us, it took a good 5-10 min for our server to come over. Not a very reassuring start to dinner at a new place! We soon found out that they were having a great drink special off 1/2 all local beers. And they have an amazing local beer selection... Four Peaks, Papago, Grand Canyon, San Tan, and a few more. 

We ordered a small Caesar salad and medium Hawaiian pizza to share. Service was sloooow. The salad was good, but the portion very small. The pizza was amazing, especially the crust! We weren't sure if the medium would be enough... but it was 6 big slices!

Besides the slow service, the prices were steep. The beers were $3.50 each at the special price (usually 7), small salad $5, and pizza $18. Before the Groupon, our bill was $33... a little much for a pizza place. Even with the Groupon, I still didn't feel like I got a great deal. Instead, it made it just bearable."}
{"text":"Oh Mellow Mushroom; how cool you are, but my love is more of a like for you. I'll be honest right away - not my favorite style of pizza crust, which is why it's just OK to me. I'm more of a thin crust person, but that said; the pizza is pretty good and the options are many to choose from. It's a funky place with a great beer selection. Yes, PBR is there for all of us premium drinkers, so enjoy. The also have trivia, but the they're in the early stages, so the cell phones are still out too much and the cheating is considered cool (not cool)...ha. If it's your first visit, go during the week, or get take out, as if you go on the weekend, you'll find every family in Myers Park in line waiting for a table."}
{"text":"I loved coming here during the summertime. I would sit at the bar and get a couple of drinks while waiting on an order of to go. This place has slipped fast in the last few months though. One of my pizzas was so sour from bad garlic that I couldn't stomach it. And now the drinks are terribly inconsistent. My favorite whiskey drink tasted sweet (it shouldn't be) and weak tonight. Then I had two cosmopolitans - one nicely strong and full to the brim. The second was light pink, weak and 3/4 full. Same bartender too. I'm pretty much over this place."}
{"text":"I, of course, went here with a groupon and high hopes! I had been before but only for happy hour so I didn't try the pizza. We went there because they offer gluten free pizza and were hoping to find a great new place. Unfortunately, this was anything but. The crust was flat out not good. It was soggy and tasted awful. I barely choked down two pieces and that was only because I was hungry enough for it to seem worth it. I know finding good gluten free food can be difficult, but go ahead and cut this one off the list. Picazzo's is much better and for about the same price you can actually eat their food!"}
{"text":"We've only been to this Mellow Mushroom about three times.  That's where it's going to stop.  We stopped by this past Saturday night.  For a Saturday, they weren't very busy at all.  Because it was an awesome night, we asked to sit outside.  Most people at the restaurant were outside; there was hardly anyone inside.  That's why it puzzles me that we received awful service and there was no obvious management overseeing the operation.  Our server, Julianna, was extremely inattentive to us and, frankly, couldn't care less that we were there.  I asked her about what a particular beer was like and I could tell she wasn't really listening to me.  She just wrote down that I wanted that beer.  Fine, whatever.  The others ordered water.  She rarely visited our table after that.  When we had been sitting there awhile waiting on our dinner, we had to actually ASK her to refill the water glasses.  One of them was empty, so she took that one to refill, but she didn't even bother with the one that was halfway.  A good server would fill them both.  And I didn't want one, but I was never asked about another beer (or obviously water) either.   The food came out hot and delicious, but it seemed strange there was no offer of Parmesan cheese or red pepper flakes or anything.  There weren't any on any of the tables.  We didn't see her again until we had finished our dinner and asked her for a box for the leftover pizza.  Despite the restaurant being practically dead, it still took her awhile to bring the box, check, etc.  We were just in the restaurant for way too long, especially when our drinks were never refilled.  A manager never came by to see how everything was going.  Nobody seemed to care, and it wasn't even busy (and it was a Saturday night).   Also, during everything, my partner apparently ended up leaving his credit card there (or else it wasn't in the book after she processed the charge).  The next night (Sunday night), we called around 8 PM to see if the card was there because we'd swing by to get it.  The hostess, Victoria, said they were in the \"dinner rush\" and she'd have to take our name and number and have someone call us back.  If their dinner rush was anything like the \"dinner rush\" Saturday night, there was no rush.  And now, here it is Monday as I write this review, and no one ever called us back.  We just reported the credit card as stolen, as basically that's what it was at this point.  We won't be back to Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"We took our friends who are visiting from St. Louis here for lunch on Friday, June 27.  We placed our order with our waiter.  Two of us ordered pizza with vegan cheese.  After a considerable amount of time someone came to our table to inform us that the pizzas have butter and parmesan on the crust and asked if we would like to omit that.  We said yes.  Another lengthy amount of time went by and when the order arrived only one pizza had vegan cheese and the other had been prepared with regular cheese and the buttery, parmesan crust.  The waiter told the woman who was helping him deliver our food that both pizzas were to be made vegan.  They told me they would make another one right away.  We waited...and waited...and waited.  The pizza finally came out and everyone else was finished with their food.  The waiter apologized and said the cost of that pizza would be removed from the bill.  We were there for almost 2 hours which was not our intention as we had plans following lunch.  It was frustrating and aggravating.  The menu proudly advertises that pizzas can be made vegan.  This vegan will not be returning.  I want to count on my food order being properly prepared when I dine out.  Mellow Mushroom needs to pay attention to dietary accommodations, especially since they make special note of doing so on their menu."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Staff is inconsiderate, unprofessional and insanely bad for business. Learn how to manage your human capital mellow mushroom."}
{"text":"I've been the Mellow Mushroom restaurants in Delray Beach, FL, Denver, Rockville, San Diego and now Scottsdale!  It has the same funky ambiance, friendly staff and good pizza as their other locations.

Located in the middle of the trendy High Street, this restaurant works well with a fun night out.  I personally go to the comedy club a few blocks down and finish off with a \"Mellow Mushroom\" pizza.  I appreciate that the wait staff took the time to learn my name, and were friendly but professional.

I will sometimes work on my laptop at the bar and they have convenient plugs to charge my phone and laptop throughout the restaurant.  Their wifi speed is decent too.

Of course, there are TV's all over the place showing sports.  Not my thing, but I was able to watch Netflix on my phone without a problem.

They offer gluten free options for all their pizzas so it's great to have choices.  There are plenty of vegetarian options as well.

The restaurant is great as my healthier friends have options there plus my gluten vegan friends have options as well."}
{"text":"Went here for weekday lunch. Parking available in rear, which is convenient. Waiter was good; proper amount of attentiveness. 
I had the meatball sub. The meatballs and marinara were good; the roll was a bit crusty for my taste.
The place has nice decor, enough TVs to keep sports fans happy, and a nice mix of tables and booths."}
{"text":"This was great pizza. Danielle and i had a large pizza w/ pepperoni and banana peppers (my half also had mushrooms). We also had some hot pretzels with mustard - good, but a little too salty for me.

everything about the pizza was great but I'd request no Parmesan cheese on the crust the next time. 

this is the kind of place i want to invite my friends to go to with me. i think they'd love the vibe and the pizza. we'll see. i plan to ask sometime soon."}
{"text":"I used to love MM, but they just seem to continue to go downhill.  I took some guests out to lunch there, on a slow day when there were a total of 3 other tables there, and STILL received \"so-so\" food and service.  

First, not only did our cheese bread app take forever, but when it finally came, it was cold and dry.  And we couldn't even eat it until the waiter decided to finally bring plates and utensils.  Why this was not done right away, or anytime during the 25 minute wait, I don't know.  I actually got up to go get stuff for us to eat it with, along with salt and pepper that was also not on the table, and as I was coming back to the table, the pizzas were arriving.  WTH?  There were seriously THREE tables in the whole place...thats not even acceptible when a place is actually busy!  And if your app comes within like 3-5 minutes of your appetizer, it should be free!  

Then, we specifically ordered our pizzas with extra cheese because this place has been very light handed with it in the past.  Not only was there still not much cheese on it, but one pizza was burnt, while the other was still doughy.  Gross.  Too pricey a pizza for what you get. I'm gonna have to throw in the towel on wasting anymore time or money here."}
{"text":"Oh, Mellow Mushroom, thank you for a great laugh!  My mother INSISTED on coming here for the night before Mother's Day while we were on vacation only to turn red as a beet as soon as we walked in and she got the hint from the decor.

Anyway.  I love the crusts here and the soup was absolutely delicious.  The mixed drink I got was so outrageously strong I couldn't even taste what sort of general flavor it was supposed to have, just alcohol (both good and bad?).  It was a little louder than I generally prefer, but I can live with it for the food."}
{"text":"I don't know it if was because I had been sleep deprived or in a car for 20+ hours, but this was one of the best meals of my life. I had the Holy Shitake, added chicken, and I can't stop thinking about it. So much.....that I'm writing this review 3 weeks after my visit. Relaxed place, in an awesome location. No complaints from me."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my trip today to the Mellow Mushroom, the pizza was wonderful whole wheat crust with molasses my friend and I were able to do a half and half pizza she did the holy shiitake and I did the house special minus a few veggies.we also ordered their pretzels appetizer and they were equally amazing.not only that our server austin with was wonderful as well. we enjoyed our late lunch on the patio and the weather was perfect.I am sure I will have a repeat visit at least a few times to this place I was so impressed, and I've already had a reheat of my leftover pizza and its just as good as the first time.the inside was well decorated and I actually loved the finish is in the washroom. I have not one bad thing to say. I actually can't wait to take my family when they visit from Prescott."}
{"text":"1 hour To get food for 4 people at noon on Saturday. A pizza , cheese calzone and sandwich. Without asking , the waitress  told us they had some \"new guys\"  in the kitchen ..The Restaurant was  a quarter of the way full and 3 tables were served before us . Almost walked out . I'd hate to see it if it's busy . The restaurant was a lot better in years past , I wondered why the parking lot was only half full on a Saturday . Like another comment on Yelp noted , this place is in need of a deep cleaning . Management needs to refocus .  I won't be back for a long time , if ever ..."}
{"text":"Love the food and everyone is pretty nice.  The wait time is annoying when they are busy.  Great pizza and they'll make it just the way you want."}
{"text":"Great service, great pizza, great beer and the outside couches are the cherry on top. Always love coming here to watch a game and have good convo with friends."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, at 11:30 when we were seated there was exactly zero customers and it stayed that way until 12:15.  I think I know why.  Place smelled weird like nasty vinegar combined with a frat house after a party.  Had wings and pizza, both were marginal at best and WAY overpriced.  Total ripoff!  Service was pretty good but the overall concept is a bust IMO.  Take my advice, find an alternative."}
{"text":"We visited this location several times. At lunch the service was very good. The food was ok. When we visited for dinner, the service was terrible. The servers seemed to spend an extraordinary amount of time with customers they knew.  It took up to fifteen minutes to get drinks, additional time to order , and even longer to be served. This is not a place I would visit for service. The overall appearance to us was they really didn't care about the customer or experience."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, low prices... this place is a win as far as i'm concerned. i need to keep working on the pizza to find a favorite, but in the meantime i'll keep coming back for that italian hoagie on wheat..."}
{"text":"This is my second try at Mellow mushroom both times it took forever to get my pizza and its way overpriced for the quality served will not be going back."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3-4 times since it's opening & each time the service has been consistently poor, tolerable but definitely below par. I have continued to go back hoping it was a \"working the kinks\" out situation & as they were open longer everything would fall into place - NO WAY. I will never go back. Our experience last night by far topped the list of mouth open this-is-so-ridiculous-I-can't-believe-it-is-actually-happening-in-real-life. 

The menu says **ask about our gluten free beers** so I did & was informed the only gf beer was pear cider. Slightly annoyed because the menu is a little misleading.

After the bartender got our drinks, our actual server took forever to come to the table (even though she walked back & forth 3-4 times) We wanted a gluten free pizza so I asked her what size the gf crust was & she said 10 inches. We ordered 2 pizzas, asking for no cheese on both. We also \"built our own salad\" asking specifically if the green olives were pitted & ordered those - our salad come to the table with black olives.
She came back to our table awhile later & sits down next to me (this may sound stuck up/prissy whatever but seriously, I don't know you & I did NOT come to hang out or sit by you  & I find it incredible tacky & invading to sit down without being asked just so you don't have to stand up while you talk with us) & says \"do you have an allergy\"

excuse me, what?

\" do you have a gluten allergy? or are you just trying to be healthy or eat better or something because our crust is actually healthier, that gluten free crust has preservatives and eggs and its not healthy at all\"

um again, excuse me?? I have 2 years of nutrition classes under my belt, have worked with acupuncturists, herbalists, quantum biofeedback specialists, naturopaths, and spend hours doing personal research, experiments, and reading of my own and YOU in 1 sentence are going to speculate on my food choices, make me feel self conscious & without any actual facts or data or education tell me that something is healthy & something else is not healthy for me. This is absolutely unacceptable in my eyes & downright rude. 

She then goes on to explain that there are other aspects of the pizza's that aren't gluten free & we need to order off the gluten free menu, um HELLO?? Why is it that I am just being told about this menu now, wouldn't you have thought to bring to my attention there is a gluten free menu when I first asked about the gluten free crust? 
She brings the menu and it says the crust is in fact 12 inches (didn't I just ask her this question & she said 10?)
 
so now we decide we only need 1 pizza & want to stick with the thai dye pie (I had heard its really tasty). She says its not on the gluten free menu & other things about it (not just the crust) have gluten. ok, so what are the other 'things'? 

She checks and comes back and says the sauce.I ask what other sauces could be used and she says none, you need to order off the gluten free menu. seriously WTF at this point. 
My husband doesn't want to go sauce-less because the pizza will be super dry so I say that's fine, I am sure a little sauce won't be a big deal for my stomach & I only plan on eating 1-2 pieces at most anyways. 

Instead of just taking our order as is our server then responds w/ \"do you have an allergy or not\"

so rude, & most importantly, If she is going to go around giving health advice she should at least have a basic understanding of gluten, what it is, how it affects people, allergies, etc. gluten is not black & white, if you are allergic you don't eat one speck & break into convulsions like some people may from beans, peanuts, etc. It affects everybody differently ranging from malabsorption of nutrients, gas, bloating, headaches, leaky gut, etc. etc. - full blown celiacs have a much harder time & need to ensure no gluten is ever consumed, while some people just try to make prudent choices when available to limit the amount of adverse digestive problems that accompany consumption of gluten. There is also no reason why I should have to explain this, myself, or my choices to the server - especially when she is having a bad attitude. 
She finally goes away and our pizza comes out (over 30 minutes later) w/ yep, tons of melted cheese all over the place. 

We sent it back & when she came back told her what happened & said we wanted it togo, not only did she not apologize she didn't even say anything. We finally got the correct pizza & it was pathetic. There were barely any toppings & she had them put the sauce on the side, saying \"she still didnt understand if we had an allergy or not\" AAAAHHH! 

While waiting for our check she sat down hugging the guy at the table next to ours carrying on personal conversations, etc.
 helloooo??? we need our bill! 

no coupons, no apologies, nothing. I was a server for 5 years & I would NEVER let my husband tip someone $0 but I was so upset we left the exact amount and got out of there as fast as possible."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try a Mellow Mushroom for a while now... I've heard lots of good things. The pizza was absolutely delicious. The crust was definitely the best part... I wish you could just order that. The only negative here were the terrible wings: they weren't served hot, they were small and lacked flavor. Should have skipped those. I had the grapefruit basil martini which was awesome. I think they may have used fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Overall I think it was a tad bit expensive for a pizza joint but I'm glad I checked it out. Too bad there isn't one in Tucson!"}
{"text":"By FAR the best tap beer selection in Scottsdale.  Their pizza is amazing too. I effing love this place"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon.

The waiter was pleasant.  The food was just above average.  The prices were steep.

We showed up at 6pm on a Friday night...and I expected to wait for a seat and wait a long time for food.  Surprisingly we were seated right away and our service was quick and easy.

We ordered the pizza that has olive oil, garlic and EGGS.  Totally strange but tasty.  It was a bit salty, but it was cool to say we've tried it.

The two of us ordered one pizza (shared) and two sodas.  Our bill was $32 bucks.  Kinda high for two guys to eat pizza on Mill Ave.

I'm doubtful we'll return just because the prices were so high."}
{"text":"This was the third strike for this restaurant chain. The first 2 times we went to Mellow Mushroom was at the location on Pinnacle Peak Rd. The service was HORRID. We had a fairly large group, which we called ahead and they knew we were coming. We waited probably a good 15 minutes or more before our drink order was taken. It took an hour and 15 minutes before ANY food came out and they only brought one or two things at a time. The first people who got food were long done by the time the last people got their food. There were only 4 other tables occupied in the restaurant at the time. The manager apologized told us to come back and he'd buy us all a round of drinks. Some of our group decided to give them another try, and we returned a couple weeks later. The manager wasn't there but was on his way, so we decided to stay. We ordered, service was really slow again, and we were not comped any drinks. 
We recently began eating vegan and had heard were some vegan choices at Mellow Mushroom so we thought we'd give it another try but at the High Street location. I ordered a vegan pizza. It came but didn't have on it what I ordered. I didn't say anything and decided to eat it anyway. I took a bite, but it was so undercooked and doughy there was no way I could eat it. They did remake it, but now everyone was done eating and I hadn't gotten mine yet. The waitress never refilled our empty waters, and she took forever bringing our check. The manager did offer me a $25 gift certificate to come back, but as they say..... \"Three strikes and you're out.\" We will never eat there again. ........and did I mention it was my birthday. Definitely a birthday restaurant fail."}
{"text":"I first went to Mellow Mushroom where they started back home in Atlanta. I'm glad to say the pizza is just as good at this one, and is some of the best in the area."}
{"text":"The Service is about a 2, the beer and the selection is about a 5 and the pizza itself is about a 3. The best pizza I have had there is their Magical Mystery Tour. Very unique and good, the rest are average or below. I like the atmosphere but the servers are not great. Very forgetful, don't come by often and are overall unpleasant. They don't seem to be happy there for some reason. Anyway, I have been there 3 times now and 3 stars is all I can give. Sorry guys, great concept but a lot of work to do still."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. Waited 10 min for the server Logan to greet us. Food was excellent however the lack of customer service following a horrible, all lime juice (expensive) margarita and a kid who spilled water leaves this place with much to be desired. The manager didn't acknowledge any of our issues and the server never bothered to clear any dirty plates or empty cups away. Despite liking the food, I don't think we will return"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've reviewed here before and said that it's the crust makes the pizza....and it is so true! And this crust is sooooo delicious! It crunchy, not to thin or thick and full of flavor....add some delcious and fresh toppings and you have a great meal!

This time I tried the Buffalo Chicken pizza. It came with huge pieces of chicken yummy saut√©ed onions and lots if cheese !!! What more could you ask for? 

There are plenty of other options for me to try and I look forward to that but this one is going in my favorites list!

YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Nice crust but seasoned with something industrial. Pizza toppings are whimpy for the price and so was the portion of pretzel bites we shared. All buck and no bang."}
{"text":"It was average at best.   I would much rather eat at Grimaldi's, nothing beats Grimaldi's.    I eat at the one at Park West off the 101 and Northern.    You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to take a chance and try this place this afternoon. Neither of us have been so disappointed and angered with a lunch experience in quite some time.  The food was barely edible and the service was abysmal! 
We were seated quickly after being told it would be a 10 minute wait. Our server came by immediately to take drink and food orders. If we had known that would be about the last time we'd see him, I would have given him an agenda for the rest of our meal. Our beers and waters came out quickly but we waited about 30 more minutes for our spinach artichoke dip appetizer. It was gooey and cold with petrified garlic toast but we ate it because we were starving. We sat for another 20ish minutes with empty water and beverage glasses and scraps of our appetizer left that were clearly not going to be eaten. My friend noticed that our server was apparently also the bartender and was chatting up a lady sitting at the bar. Fed up, she went up to him and asked if it was going to be much longer for our calzone. He told her he would check and we watched him scamper up to the window and take a plate that was sitting on an upper shelf. He came back and stated, \"they put it up just as I got there!\" He then proceeded to leave our lukewarm lunch on the table without any offer of clean plates, drink refills for our long empty glasses or 'can I get you anything else?' The cheese that had oozed out of the calzone was cold and waxy. I managed to find a tiny warm spot in the middle. We sadly ate then waited and waited for our waiter to appear which was silly on our part. We asked another server to bring our check which she did quickly and with apologies. Our quick lunch took over an hour and a half. I'll never visit this, or any other Mellow Mushroom based on this experience."}
{"text":"Great place! Great service. Almost as good as Angelos (but no need to wait!) and far better than any other 'za we've gotten in Lakewood, River or Westlake. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Lost a star because this place is EXPENSIVE! 

But it's also delicious... So if you can afford to fork over $40+ for a small pizza and drinks -- go! This location has MUCH friendlier service than it's Tempe counterpart (on Mill). Quick as can be with made to order pizza. I love the pretzels and beer cheese - yum! Can't go wrong with them, but again the price for just the cheese is $3.50+... Love the decor!! And it's huge - good for groups :-)"}
{"text":"I'm just not a fan of their pizza. They have a fantastic beer list which keeps me coming back. The service is outstanding as well. We had the pretzels for an appetizer and they were incredibly disappointing. Food is just nothing to be excited about."}
{"text":"Very nice venue for a private party, large or small. The large space is upstairs, has a private bar and bathrooms, and overlooks the main dining area. Not great for lecture style gatherings, we brought a microphone and amp in case the noise was too overwhelming. Turned out we didnt need it but glad we had it with us anyway. The small private room is totally private and very nice, seats 12-15 people.
The food is great and the staff are very friendly. Great location right off the 10 and Ray Rd. We'll probably use this venue for an event again."}
{"text":"Since me and my bf are on a gluten free and casein free diet and we were missing pizza, we are pleased to know that this place has a gluten free crust available. We already know they have vegan cheese since his brother in law is lactose intolerant and we eat here with him. It was really tasty. I'm glad we are able to eat here when we want to go out for pizza."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite pizza shop (in Arizona) , hands down. The flavor of the crust is by far the best I've had in Arizona!! The sauce is perfect and not over done on the pizza and the cheese and the toppings Are so flavorful, my favorite is the meaty pizzA. So yummy!!!!!"}
{"text":"Recommend the bruschetta!  I come here on occasion because it's on my way home from work.  Sometimes I meet the family but usually just stop by for a drink.  The pizza is good but pricey.  The wings are not worth it (too small) but the meatballs and bruschetta are really good.  I like to go to MM when I travel because of the wide selection of local craft beer.  The beer selection is AWESOME.  Great servers and bartenders, too.  I've never had bad service here.  Would highly recommend for appetizers and drinks with friends.  Not so much for a big dinner..."}
{"text":"Bad choice to not validate parking in downtown Tempe. Your restaurant used to do it. Won't be back. Shame on you for saving a buck. Probably why you were empty."}
{"text":"Good pizza, I love the house special.  My hubby loves the meaty mighty pizza.  It is a little pricy without a groupon, but with the $20 groupon it's not bad.  Wish they had better prices on appetizers.  They all seem expensive for what you get.  Service always seems good.  I'll go back with a coupon, probably won't without one."}
{"text":"Loved the spinach salad.  I'll have to find out what kind of dressing that was in it.  Yumm  The beer selection is the first thing that I would come back for.  We ordered the Gourmet White pizza which has:
Olive Oil and Garlic base pizza with Sun-Dried Tomatoes, Provolone, Mozzarella, Feta, Roma Tomatoes and Onions.
Yummy. Especially the crust, which is a wheat crust that compliments the pizza very well.  Nothing left on my plate!  Hope to try the meatier, yes, I made up that word, pizzas next time!"}
{"text":"Great experience today with my daughter.  We have always driven by this restaurant and never stopped.  Today we had a mommy daughter lunch date and she wanted to give it a try...  To my surprise it was great we ordered pretzel bites and a cheese pizza and they were both delicious, and the service was outstanding!!!  This made a great lunch date and even better shopping experience once our tummies were full"}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon, had heard good things about it so I thought we would give it a whirl.  

The location at City North is a bit cool, with lots of other restaurants and the live/eat/play type situation.  

This location is easy to find and parking wasn't that bad. The 3 stars is the service is sloooowww and it wasn't even that busy.  The food, while original in the combination choices was ok. Not bad, not great, kinda pricey for what it is.  Will I go back without a Groupon, probably not."}
{"text":"Father's day went here at 4:50 , no one really there, got seated right way. Sat down and no one came to take our order and 10 minutes later still no one so we walked out. When we said said something they looked all shocked even though a couple of them had seen us sitting there. Mind you there were waitresses who had walked by and people who were seated after us who got their drinks. Now I see why they have 3 stars (they deserve no stars for this)... they deserve it."}
{"text":"Love Love LOVE Mellow Mushroom! By far my most favorite pizza place ever! And if you love craft beer, they have a TON OF amazing beer on tap! We like their hot potato pie and their buffalo chicken the most! But really, you can't go wrong with any of the food they have!!! YUM!"}
{"text":"Don't know how the food is. We've been here 45 minutes and no food yet. It's so not crowded in here at 1:30 on a Monday holiday afternoon. Our server Kevin was rude, slow and too old to be serving. Never will come back here. The food may turn out great....but this first impression leaves little to be desired. Guess what? A table next to us went to the bar to get their own beers....again Kevin was their server.  When I said the pizza better be be good I've waited forever.....Kevin only said let's hope so. Update: He also failed to give us hh pricing on the ONE beer we ordered....we couldn't order more he didn't check back on us until we finally finished eating. This was an experience to remember. FYI the pizza wasn't that great I'd rather have Vito's in Mesa than this hot mess. I'd never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Drove down to Tempe to have lunch with my daughter. Good food. Great service"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Mellow Mushroom and finally got the chance when we were looking for somewhere kid friendly in Tempe. She we got there (around 5:30pm on a Thursday night) we were happy to be seated right away. The hostess was nice and our server came right over and took our drink order. Happy hour was going on (half priced bar drinks, except bombers) but we didn't order drinks this night. 

Thinking that pizza would allow us to have an easy dinner and share was a mistake on my part. First glance at the kid's menu and the little ones could really care less about sharing pizza with mom and dad. The girls decided on the meatballs and Mac and cheese. Our server let us know that all specialty pies could be made half and half so we ordered half with the Red Potato option and the other half Magic Mushroom.

The wait time was average and all food arrived to the table hot. Hubby and I didn't share  with each other so I can't comment on his choice, but he seemed the enjoy it. My choice was pretty good...nice amount of potatoes, bacon, and the sauce was spicy but not inedible. It was good. The crust held the toppings well, but it was wheat. Blech. I didn't see crust options on the menu (besides gluten free), only that they brush it with garlic and parm (which was really light btw),  but I really wish there was a white dough. Just like I prefer my pb & j on white bread, I prefer my pizza on white dough. I am able to overlook this though...there are other pizzas I want to try so if that means that I have to eat a wheat crust then so be it.

So why 3 stars then? It all comes down to the kid's menu. $5.50 for a kid's entree (includes drink). Not horrible. We eat out a lot, the price is average. The serving size however, is not. Like I said, one child got the meatballs. Granted, she LOVED them, but she got 3. 3!!! Now we can split hairs and say, \"there were actually six\", but they were small, with cheese in the middle, and when put together made three regular balls. Slap a little sauce on it and serve it with some apples that were cut at 11am, and you have yourself a meal for a four year old. Problem is my little one is almost eight and she was still hungry. The other little one ordered Mac and cheese. Thanks for putting some Annie's boxed stuff under the broiler. Ugh...I hate paying so much for boxed crap (even if it is natural and not Kraft).

So the lesson is, take your family, share a pizza, Don't order off the kid's menu unless you are into wasting money, and get here during happy hour."}
{"text":"We drove up around this side of town often,  the warm summer morning made for the perfect opportunity to order some take out pizza. Curiosity had gotten the best of us and we wanted to feel fancy. We ordered a Gourmet White pizza with Feta cheese. It was bland at best. The Pepperoni from the second pie was to organic and lacked in flavor. With a little too much dough for anyone's taste, it'd make the little Pillsbury guy go nuts. 

On top of all this was a half awake staff that had little to no customer service training. No eye contact whatsoever. It felt real cold and empty in the restaurant."}
{"text":"WooooooHooooo 100th review!!!  I eat here all the time, but I've gotta take the chance to be the 100th review.

Although, a little over priced for pizza(IMO), its damn good and honestly its not that bad $ wise.  Also, they've added a few menu items that are all worth checking out.  Not to mention they've done a few things to bring in the crowds.  A $3 pint night on Mondays and I've heard they're doing a movie night as well.  Don't know if they are kid friendly movies though.  A Shrek/Nemo matinee when schools out for the summer would kill it.

This is probably the best kid friendly restaurant in town where the parents can actually eat good food and drink good booze.  The environment is very chill and the staff are quite cordial.  I highly recommend the shiitake pie or the Cosmic Karma but you can't really go wrong.

Bottom line:  I feel like I could go on and on about this place but don't know that I need to, just check it out.  Its a hippie themed pizza place with top notch ingredients, a kind vibe, a beautiful outdoor dining area, and overall sense of well being.

Just know that the pies are made to order so be ready to wait 30-45 minutes+ when they are busy.  So grab a beer and app."}
{"text":"Went here in May 2010.  

Despite being busy service was good. 

The beer selection was fantastic including several solid IPA's.

The food tasted fine.  We had the philosopher's pie pizza and a vegetarian one.

What ruined the experience for us was literally being ill afterwards."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza.  I liked it a lot more than I thought I would.  My go to pizza is Barros or Pizza Factory.  The crust was cooked nicely with a good crunch.  Good flavors on the house special pizza.  Good amount of toppings.  Wish there was more cheese.  But it was very tasty.  Will definitely be back.  He the group in and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It was very good.  Maybe a little over priced?  It was much better pizza than I was expecting.  Nice amount of cheese and good toppings. The crust was  crispy, but not over cooked.  It was very reverberant inside the place though. I was practically yelling at my friends so they could hear me.  It was exhausting. Ill probably go back and try them again when they are slower and not so noisy."}
{"text":"I have seen these restaurants throughout the valley and finally decided to stop in the one closest to home. It's really has a cool and unique design to it and I think happy hour would be fun here. I know they have a large selection of beers, but nothing local on tap (that may change as it opened about a month ago). I thought the pizza was okay. I would come back again to try something else since all of their other menu items looked tasty."}
{"text":"Oh my God I absolutely adore this place. They have the greatest reverse happy hour from 10 PM till 2 AM. They have a great selection of beers too, lots of IPAs on draft. They also have great pizza! The crust is wonderful!!!!  I've fallen in love with the mighty meaty.. The wings are pretty good I even like their barbecue sauce. They do have a dog friendly patio that's on Mill Avenue so plenty of people watching available.. Never can go wrong here for a cheap night. Love!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Bought a groupon, but still paid well above what I expected to for a small pizza, app and one beer $29. All draft beer here is $6/16oz. The pretzel app was tasty, but it was simply pizza dough in a pretzel shape. Beer cheese was ok, but cost just as much as the pretzels ($3.29). The hostess staff is in booty shorts which I don't prefer to look at while eating (call me a prude haha). The vibe is trendy, but inauthentic. I was hoping for a neighborhood type feel and some good pizza - this place falls short of that.

Overall I wouldn't recommend and won't be frequenting this place."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom tip has a lot going for it; decent beer selection, interesting appetizers and a few unique pizzas that actually work.

I usually pop in here for their solid happy hour when doing movies next door at Harkins. Beer lists is usually solid (though too much sugary fruit laced chick shit lately), and they rotate often. They may not have the selection of Yardhouse, but they sometimes have more depth; the unique stuff they offer can be surprisingly good. 

Pizzas are good. Crust is good, not too thick, a little chewy, but not terribly so. They need to go easy on buttering the edges, it can be a bit greasy if there's a liberal hand in the kitchen. Some of the specialty pizzas are really good; Shittake is very solid. Pretzel bites are a great appetizer. 

However, the problem with this location (and also the one at High Street) is the service. Never consistent, not particularly attentive and certainly what keeps them from getting a higher rating.

Last time I went we had a decent perimeter of empty pint glasses and plates around us (both ours and other customers) because the bartenders were too busy fucking off around the not-particularly-busy bar to bus. Drinks and food service can be slow. Everyone is friendly enough, but there's not as much hustle here as other spots I typically frequent. Seems to be a recurring trend based on other reviews.

Bottomline; good choice for happy hour, good pizzas, but don't expect stellar service."}
{"text":"Literally forgot that we even ordered food. Waited over an hour for brushetta. There were four other people in the place on a Sunday night. Not quite sure where the disconnect was. Shitty place and won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  I walked in and was instantly mesmerized.  The murals on the wall were so trippy. Our waiter was fantastic!  Anthony was so cool and easy going, he explained everything to us from crust origins to toppings to calzones.  I cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the drink selection. The bar is a fun place to sit and and eat, and is big enough so you don't have to stand around in a crowded area. The pizza is great too, of course ;)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. It looks so neat from the outside, huge space, nice bar. The food was horrendous and came with a hair and flies in it (not kidding). The staff checked up on me once, never gave me silverware or condiments or a napkin. When I was done with my food my plate sat in front of me until I could get the bartenders attention to sign out. There were no \"thank yous\" even though as I left I said thank you very much. The place was also hot, their air conditioning did not work well. I will never go there again. Shame too because it could be a much better place. They are wasting their potential. I recommend people look elsewhere; you can find much better on the same street."}
{"text":"Cool little joint with average food! The ambiance is fun: 70/80s Rock and roll, hippy culture which was fun and unique- a cool place for kids! They left you split your pizza 1/2 one kind, 1/2 another for free which is nice! They have a 12\" gluten free pizza which there isn't an uncharge for (yay!) but it's the same prepackaged tasteless gf crust that you get at the grocery store. Blah! I wish places made their own gf crust in house!"}
{"text":"I really want to love Mellow Mushroom, but after being here a handful of times, I feel just like meh. The service is never speedy, it sometimes takes 5 minutes or more just to have our drink order taken, and the food takes anywhere from 35-45 minutes. 

The mushroom soup is the best thing on the menu. The pizza is pretty good, but there is better across the street in either direction. And the calzones leave something to be desired. They have a good choice of ciders, and mostly have good drink specials. Good for a group, but not for a date."}
{"text":"Food was great but took a long time.
Mgr came around  to apologize.
Jen our waitress did well"}
{"text":"Being a newly vegan family, it is so refreshing to find establishments that are conscious of our needs and attend to them.  The hummus is delicious and so is the pizza! Thank you mellow mushroom"}
{"text":"I swung by here with my brother after he suggested it. It was a nice surprise. Spacious area and tasty. Service was quick but we also went at a time when almost nobody was there. Price of pizza was slightly above average. Can't judge the alcoholic drinks as I didn't get them."}
{"text":"We went here with our toddlers last week. I was meeting my husband on his lunch break and they took FOREVER to serve us! The waitress was terrible and we could see her from the kitchen having a conversation, the place wasn't even packed. The food was good but the service terrible. Won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"While waiting for hotel room to get ready why stumbled in here for a drink and bite to eat. Service started out different as the server was easily confused. But hey give me a drink and I'm good. I ordered the Jerk Chicken Hoagie. It was okay enough to fill me and tasted pretty good. Ordered another drink and just kicked back and took in the views as we sat on the patio. Mill street is a busy area with the college. It worked and the weather was prefect."}
{"text":"I live exactly in the middle of this location and the location at Desert Ridge on Tatum, and we decided to check this one out hoping it would not be as busy and more quiet since it was a week day night.  It sure was not busy at all, maybe 5-6 tables seated in the restaurant when we walked in.  Yet my family of 3, including a toddler, was sat in the bar in a booth that was currently being used as an arm rest for a homeless man (let's just leave it as .... he smelled....) I would have chosen a million other tables for us, but the hostess chose that one. Okay, let's roll with it.  Our waitress quickly greeted us and took our drink order and gave us a minute to decide on food.  By the time she came back with beverages, we put in our order for 2 pizzas.  Those 2 pizzas took almost 45 min to cook.  I get it, they are fresh made to order, but I have never had to wait that long for pizza!  And not once while we sat there trying not to stare at the obnoxious bartender or cringe at the smell wafting from our homeless over-looker did our waitress stop by to see if we needed refills or give us the ol' -your food will be right out- line.  When the pizzas did finally come out, they were piping hot.  I was glad to see that was the only thing this location had in common with the others-- the food is still pretty darn tasty (and worth the usual 20min wait- not 45 min).  We will not return to this location, but will continue frequenting the other locations.  Poor poor poor service....

P.S. Don't order a mixed drink.  My $10 Mojito must of contained the finest mint and simple syrup in the world because that's all the really was."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza crust. We had the Holy Shitaki pizza. No regrets. Huge beer list and good service. This is the largest Mello I have ever been in. We had been to MMs out East and are happy to see them in the Valley. Good food and service is pretty normal with MMs so it's a matter of how well you like their pizza. Nice to have variety and MM gives us that."}
{"text":"Sat there for over 10 min no one checked in us or even anyone pass by to say I'll be your server....we walked out, this place will be a scratch off my places to eat in the future."}
{"text":"I came here for a steak and cheese hoagie and I was delighted! The steak was so tender! Sure you can be mesmerized by their pizza but at least try their hoagies too. Don't wait another day to swing by Mellow Mushroom!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I really like Mellow Mushroom and have been to several of their other locations in other cities along with their location on Selwyn.  I live in the area so I couldn't wait for the opening!  I went for a late lunch/early dinner on what was supposed to be opening day only to be told they didn't have their permits.  They did offer to let my daughter and I stay for a FREE meal to help train their staff.  That experience was really not bad.  The pizza was a little under cooked, but I figured they were in training.  

I went a second time for my son's birthday for lunch.  It was busy, but we were sat in the bar area, which was no problem.  Although the service was fine, this time the pizza was over cooked.  I actually like my pizza on the well done side, but this was really over cooked:  brown cheese, hard crust, etc.  

Finally, went last night for an early New Year's Eve dinner.  At 5:00, there was a 30 minute wait.  I wasn't shocked by this and decided to have a beer at the bar.  This is were things started to fall apart.  After receiving the beer menu, our bar tender disappeared.  After about 7 minutes, another bar tender asked if we put our drink order in yet.  When I replied that we had not, she proceeded to clean some dishes off the bar  left by another patron and went to take another customer's order instead!  When you have a bar that is that busy, you need experienced, competent bar staff.  We were finally seated at our table and, again, our pizza was way over cooked, lacked cheese, looked sloppy, and had very little of the topping I ordered.  The waitress was actually not too bad, but when I went to pay with my American Express, I was told the machine was down and I would need to pay with another card.  No problem.  I paid with my debit card only to realize this morning that I never received my card back from the waitress.  I called the restaurant this morning and was certain they would have my card since I know it was left there.  But- they could not find my card. I'm not sure if they even looked.  

I am annoyed and disappointed and will have to wait for the kinks to be worked out."}
{"text":"The place still rocks for happy hour specials (apps & Drinks)! Also, the Gluten Free pizza is great too. Crust is crispy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour! Great selection of draft beers and 50%off apps! I came with a few girls after class.  I would deff recommend the pretzels with the beer cheese as that was a hit at our table.  We also ordered wings, and meatballs, delicious as well!

One awesome thing was the server he was attentive and checked on us throughout the meal! He also honored the fact that a few girls had a Groupon! Deff worth checking out for HH as the deals are pretty smoking!"}
{"text":"This place awesome! They serve food till late and have a large variety of beers to choose from! Hands down my favorite pizza right now is their buffalo chicken pizza. I usually will just split the small pizza ( 4 slices) with a friend and it's the perfect portion size to get that full I'm satisfied feeling. The wings are most excellent!! Can't wait to come back for that pizza again mmmm!"}
{"text":"Great food but extremely aggravated at beer prices. We unknowingly ordered four draft beers, two medium pizzas and two sodas for the kids. The bill came and my son told me it was over $90. I told him that was impossible. He passed me the hill and indeed it was. The reason: each beer was $12. In addition to living here I have a home in West Hollywood. Generally everything in LA us more than here and yet I can honestly say I've never paid that for a beer in LA...and I go out a lot! Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"We are regulars here and have never had a disappointing meal. Food is fresh but takes forever to come out. Good beer list and atmosphere is always great. A little pricey but you pay for good quality. 

Atmosphere: Big place with a full bar and outside seating in the summer. Decorated nicely with a hippy/70's vibe. Always a good amount of people. 

Service: As regulars here we have never had one complaint from the staff. I would give another star if the wait for the food wasn't so long. Expect a 45min wait on average (never been in and out). 

Food: Always fresh and made to order. Good section of different pizza/toppings and other things on the menu like apps and subs. Try the jerk chicken sub if you like spicy. The pretzels with cheese sauce is fantastic with a good beer. Pricing is on the higher side, and along with the long wait for the food is why I would not give MM a perfect rating.  $25 for a pizza is a little steep.."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, cool set-up.  We only had pizza, so I'll stick to that.   A bit on the pricey side for a personal pizza.  Doughy crust, no crunch.  WAY too much sauce, we were blotting it on the plates to remove the excess.   With Tony's Pizza a few steps away, I can't see why I would go back.  If you want good atmosphere or want to have a few beers, cool place.  If you just want to eat good food, you can find better."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Mellow Mushroom in general. This location has consistently met or exceeded my expectations of a Mellow Mushroom. The atmosphere inside is inviting and funky. The decor is very \"mushroomy\" if that makes sense. The patio area outside is spacious and offers wonderful views of the adjacent park. 

I love that they have Abita Root Beer on tap. It is absolutely delicious! My favorite thing to get here is the Buffalo Chicken pizza. I love that they give you blue cheese dressing or ranch to dip your pizza in. It gives it the perfect added taste! I have had subs here for lunch and they are also good. This is a good place to get a pizza. They have a lot of creative options aside from your standard toppings."}
{"text":"A bit expensive. Pizza is pretty good. Wings are just ok but mine had way too much sauce. Had a steak sub and it was rather bland. After much anticipation it was a bit of a let down. Even service was slightly better than mediocre. Nice beautiful yellow sign got me the front door though! I'd probably go again to be fair but try something else on the menu."}
{"text":"I wish we had this restaurant chain in OKC! Very good pizza with reasonable prices. the crust was good, too---are you listening, Hideaway?"}
{"text":"The pizzas are mouth-watering delicious! The location is great but parking is a problem. The booths are torn and showing their age. Staff is cool. 

Check Groupon for deals!"}
{"text":"My bestie recently bought a Jeep and wanted to go for a mini roadtrip, so we headed up to Happy Valley. We hit up Wal-Mart, because that one's the best one, I think, in Phoenix, then Petco. We were hungry, and I wanted a salad, so the gal at Petco recommended the Mellow Mushroom. 

Dang!

Excellent ambience, customer service, music, atmosphere. We were only ordering to go, but I think we'll definitely be back to sit and stay awhile. The guy that greeted us at the door was upbeat and helpful. He led us to the perky gal with glasses and an updo at the to-go station. We ended up getting salads and a pizza, because it all looked so good. I got a small Greek salad. So much ham and sprouts! Wow! When we got home, I dumped it on one of my big oblong plates, and it filled up the whole stinkin' thing. We ordered the Holy Shiitake pie--omg amazing. The smell of garlic wafted through my whole house as the dog salivated (from a respectful distance). The pizza was covered with shiitake, button, and Portobello mushrooms, plus caramelized onions, mozzarella, and Montamore cheeses. Downright decadent, right? But that's not all. The pie is drizzeled with garlic aioli and black truffle oil. Seriously? Truffle oil? Goodness gracious alive.

Luckily, there was no sucking of face scheduled for that evening, because the garlic breath just would. not. die. But it was a small price to pay for a top notch meal."}
{"text":"My Mom and I were looking for some late night eats when we noticed Mellow Mushroom was open till 2a! (Pretty hard to come by a non-fast food restaurant that's open late in this part of town!)

We walked in and saw a sign that read \"See bar for service\", so we walked up to the bartender, and promptly had our drink order filled and food menus handed to us. We ended up getting the Mighty Meaty, which was everything you could hope for in an all meat pizza, and we also got the Buffalo Chicken, complete with buffalo sauce, ranch, chicken and bacon. Both pizza's were delicious and we enjoyed their interesting pizza crust.

Overall, I'm happy to see such a great place available for late night food on my side of town. The only reason why I gave it 4/5 stars was that it was a little inconvenient to get up and walk over to the bar for everything we needed since they had no servers working at the time. I say walk to the bar because we opted to sit at a table near the bar since the bar area was a little crowded. The two bartenders that were there did an excellent job getting to us as fast as they could, and checking on us periodically, I just think it would've been beneficial for them to have more help. I am unsure if no servers late at night is something this location does often."}
{"text":"The check in offer on YELP was probably the best part of this Sunday debacle. You get a free small Cesar salad upon check-in, but the pizza quality is just not good anymore. The salad was big with large croutons, lightly dressed with good romaine lettuce and hard slices of parmesan cheese. The server could not figure out how to cash the offer in, but eventually they took the salad off the bill. We had to return the first batch of pretzels due to them being cold inside and the second batch of pretzels (with butter and salt only) were hot, but seem to just not taste as good as previous visits. The server also said the beer cheese was $1 extra, but it actually was almost a $5 upcharge. Shame on him. The pizza came out and it's the same dough as the pretzels, but just didn't have the good quality from my other visit. The topping were good and fresh, but too much marinara sauce was loaded onto the tiny pie and the weight of the toppings collapsed the pizza if you attempted any kind of folding. Not the best performance and likely won't be back sans for a beer perhaps somewhere in the country."}
{"text":"First time at this location and it's a win. 

The staff was super friendly, it was early afternoon so the place was pretty empty...that just meant more attention for me!!!

I ordered my two favorites their pretzels and Mighty Meaty pizza. 

I love their pretzels- made with the same dough they use to make that super delicious pizza crust. I ordered a half order of the garlic and parmesean with red sauce...one word YUM! They came out hot, crunchy and just so freaking good.

The Mighty Meaty has all the delicious meats you can think of...on that delicious crust with red sauce. Mmmmm....It's just not enough words to describe how yum-mmmy this food is!

And I'm super excited that this location does pizza by the slice and has a late night menu!!! I can't wait to come back for that!"}
{"text":"Service was good but the spinach salad I ordered sucked. I ordered the largest size and it was barely bigger than the small. Spinach was wilted and not fresh. Pizza didn't look much better. Would not come back for food."}
{"text":"Visited my buddy in Arizona came here for his birthday dinner. Group of 20.  Wait was more than 2 hours food wasn't any faster. Maybe their lunch is better."}
{"text":"I was at Happy Valley location last week for lunch. 

Casual atmosphere, not to bad of a service either. 

Then I checked my banking account and found out that I was overcharged! My bill was around $27 and change and I was charged $57 and change. I have used a $10 groupon and after that, my bill should have been $17 and change plus tip. 

 Immediately, I called the restaurant, which was early in the morning.  
One of the employees who answered the phone claimed she was a manager and she is unable to help me; however, she will take all of my information and manager \"Brian\" will call me as soon as he gets in. 8:30PM, I am not receiving my call and I decide to call again. 

Employee puts me on hold for Brian \"the manager\". He pretty much tells me to wait out until Wednesday as they have been experiencing a lot of problems when groupon is used. Per him, everything should correct itself. He also said he would give me a call first thing Monday morning and its about 1:15PM and still no call. 

I am really disappointed on how this matter is being handled. I understand it is $30 and for the manager at Mallow Mushroom that may not be a lot but for me...It is. It makes me mad that he would not even have a courtesy to give me a call....What would happened if I never checked my statement? How many people were overcharged like this and never cut it?"}
{"text":"I was waiting on the edge of my seat for this to open in RR. We had one where I went to college and I absolutely LOVED it. Although the atmosphere isn't as \"hipster\"/mellow as the one in Kentucky (they had a giant tree in the middle), they still deliver on their food. Their pizzas are all stone baked and are made with a wheat flour base instead of white. They do take a little longer to make for this reason, so be prepared for that when you go to eat. 

If you are willing to veer off the pizza side of the menu, the Jerk chicken sandwich is really really good! My best recommendation however, would be the pretzels with the beer cheese... so so good! If you are only going to get one thing, this should be it! They have a pretty good beer selection too but that isn't really anything special for the Cleveland area. 

It is a little busy right now because it is new so if you don't want to wait, hang tight for a few weeks and i'm sure it will slow down a bit."}
{"text":"This place is great. I went to mellow mushroom last night with some friends from work and it was such a great time. Every place has a happy hour and Mellow has probably the best in town.. Half off nearly everything. I'm all about that Ketel one vodka and that's even half off! 4.50 for Ketel after ten?! Can't beat that!! (even when it's full price it's cheaper than most places)
Our server was great! Our drinks were never empty! It's not always about the food it's about the service too. And our server was stellar! Her name was Amber! She was so great I hope I sit in her section next time. 
Since it was happy hour we shared some wings and pretzels and oh my gosh were they good. When ordering the pretzels make sure you order that beer cheese, you'll find yourself licking the ramekin. 

I've been to mellow mushroom a few times and I've never had a bad time. I love MM! And I'll be back very soon! Can't wait to have the pizza next time with some more Ketel one!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's the atmosphere or what but I have been here like 10 times and have enjoyed myself every time. The pizzas are great too. The outside part of the bar is a great place to munch on some slices and check out a game. If you are looking for some tasty grub and cool vibes you should check it out!"}
{"text":"Always love coming here! Wish they had one in chandler but that's just me wanting it all! Kosmic Karma is definite favorite and so is the Thai dye pizza. Their crust is awesome! Their beer selection is great. Happy hour is wonderful. Can't complain at all!"}
{"text":"Okay this is a hard review to write because Mellow Mushroom is on one end of the spectrum or the other.  I am going to breakdown this location in 5 parts (Food Quality, Happy Hour, Beverage Selection, Cost & Service)

Food Quality - 5 Stars - Their food is great.  I have not had a single thing here that I have not liked.  Their pizza crust is the best in the industry as it is not your typical crust.  I want to say it is like a Honey Wheat crust and man it is awesome.  They are very generous with their toppings too.  They also have great appetizers as well (i.e wings, pretzels, meatballs, etc.).

Happy Hour - 5 Stars - I would give it 10 stars but they limit it to 5.  Mellow has the best Happy Hour in the industry.  1/2 price all alcohol (minus a few bomber can beers) and 1/2 price all appetizers, which I mentioned were great.  They also have a reverse happy hour for late night goers.  You really can't beat this.  Great food and drinks at 1/2 price.

Beverage Selection - 4 Stars - They have a full bar with a great selection of beers (local and not local).  They seem to specialize in microbrews, which I love, but the reason for the 4 stars is their lack of selection of the basic light beers.  For me it's not a big deal, but for some of my friends, who don't have a sophisticated palate as I do, it is a big deal.

Cost - 3 Stars - Here is where Mellow Mushroom starts to fall.  If you go there when it is not Happy Hour, you bill will rise quickly.  They are very proud of their food and they charge accordingly.  It is very easy to run that bad boy up there with just a few pies and a few drinks.

Service (Dinning Room only) - 1 Star - If I could give them a negative I would because they are SLOW.  And when I say SLOW I mean SSSLLLLOOOOOWWWW.  When you sit down expect to wait a while until you are greeted or until you are brought your drinks.  I have had appetizers come out before drinks before.  Not sure to why this is, but this is the only reason they do not get an overall 5 Star rating.  I highly advise to try to sit in the bar area.  They tend to serve you quicker.

Overall, this is a great place and is kid friendly.  They have great drinks and food for everyone.  If you haven't tried it, give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Been to Mellow Mushroom several times.  The beer menu is above average.  The service has been anywhere from slow to non existent.  The pizza is garbage.  Haven't had any other food items so I can't comment on that.

Every single time I have been here the crowd has been drunk and obnoxious.  It appears either drunk people love coming here or people come here to get really drunk.  I hear they have a killer reverse happy hour.  Two sisters were killed after a guy drank was over served here for over 4.5 hours and got on the freeway in the wrong direction.  

I read Mellow violated several AZ liquor laws and got their license suspended for a week and a $9k fine.  They should close their doors and find a new business."}
{"text":"Good food but paid for this later.  I am gluten free and my crust was definitely not kept separate from gluten products."}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment because of the welcoming & attentive staff... And they are hands down amazing.  Coming from a restaurant management standpoint I will cut back my visits based on the management/owners.  At my last visit a bald headed man working in an OPEN kitchen screamed across the dining room at a host (who by the way knows every customer by name and takes the time to interact & get to know guests unlike the owners/managers) \"you're cut, it's not a good thing, I saw what you did godd**it\" this is the worst example of leadership I've seen in a while.  Although the food and staff are great I have yet to meet the owner only past managers who are no longer there.  

This company should treat their employees better, as adults and not scold them with intent to embarrass for minuscule issues."}
{"text":"Ok. I'm pretty picky with 5 star reviews. Especially  when it comes to a restaurant that is more of a chain or franchise:  I just don't do it. However, this particular Mellow Mushroom feels like home. We are here almost every Friday night. 

Their pizza is always consistent. 
Their jerked wings are our favorite. We get them every time. 
Their beer taps are always changing and they always have new beer to try. 

These three things would earn them 4 stars. Consistency is key for me. Good food can be experienced at a lot of places, but having the same, consistent food, visit after visit is less common. 

The reason this particular location gets 5 stars is because of the service. We ALWAYS sit at the bar. We have never actually sat in the dining room. The reason this feels like 'Home' is because we see the same three people behind the bar every time. They know our names. They know how we order. They know what we order. They recommend beers based on what they know we like. They carry on a conversation. They hustle. And they have fun!  Marlena, Kara and Dustin are there because they enjoy what they do and they do it well. That is hard to find in most restaurants. A team that works together and works for the customers is a team that creates an experience worthy of a 5 Star Review. And they are worthy of 5 Stars."}
{"text":"I was really excited to see a Mellow Mushroom going in down the street from me. I have become a regular at the Happy Valley location on Friday nights so having one close was going to be great. 
Turns out, it's horrible!!  I've been 3 times now and it's been consistently a disaster and embarrassment. 
The first time I went, I sat at the bar. The bar staff seemed clueless. It took 20 minutes to get my app and the bartenders were extremely inattentive. Even though there were 4 of them and about the same number of customers.  I figured it was because the restaurant was only a week old and the staff was still learning. 
The second time I brought friends. They know the place is one of my favorites and we're excited to go because they have never been. I was so embarrassed. They kept looking at me and saying 'Really?  You like this place??'  (They know I'm picky).  So we sat there for about 30 minutes eating the disappointing food and watching the staff. Which seemed to all be smoking the 'mellow mushroom' and in state of bewilderment. At one point I asked the waitress for a bottle of OMission (gluten free beer) and she told me they just stopped selling it yesterday. I was shocked. I verified again that she heard me correctly. She said we do have a replacement that's great.  So I said 'I'll try it' and she brought me out a draft beer. I drank it and it tasted SUPER 'wheaty'. When she came back I asked if she was sure I had the gluten free beer and she said 'I don't know if we have any of those'. I asked for a manger. Turns out they DO have OMissiom and the waitress was just clueless. She laughed at thought it was funny. I didn't. 
Third strike out. Yesterday I went in at 5:00. I asked the bartender about happy hour and she said 'all the beer and all the appetizers are half price'. Great. I found a beer I wanted and ordered it and she said 'oh. That list is from May 30th and its out of date. We don't have that beer anymore. I asked for an update list and she said that was the most up to date list they had and it wasn't very accurate but she could help. So I asked for a recommendation and she brought me a beer. It was good and I ordered wings. My favorite from the other location. They were luke warm and super 'wet'. They also came out with celery and carrots. The carrots looked like rabbit droppings. They were those small carrots that come in the bag for children and are shaved down to little finger sizes. Well these were shaved down to rabbit dropping size. The other bartender noticed I had stopped eating them and asked if they were ok.   I explained I was a little bummed out the food and experience was so different from the other location on Happy Valley and on Mill. I told him about the outdated beer list and room temp wings. He was a good guy. He attempted to make it up and brought out fresh wings. He said the beer list wasn't out of date, there was just one beer that wasn't offered anymore. He then asked if I wanted another drink and I ordered one. The wings came back out and were the same as the first batch so I just ate them, knowing what they should taste like and telling myself I wasn't coming back. 
Long story short, I got my bill and both beers showed up as names other than what I ordered and were full priced. As well as the second app I ordered. He said the first drink wasn't on happy hour. And they don't actually put in the drinks that are ordered, they just put in standard drinks because that's how their computers work.   I just shook my head gave him my card and said, 'Fine. Here. I'm never coming back.'  
A manager ended up coming back and she comped my apps. I explained my concerns and the difference in experiences. She said it was a new restaurant and everybody was still in training. They have been opened a month. It's unfortunate they are a disaster. I told her I fully intended on paying for what I ate and drank, I just expected happy hour prices. She said she understood and it was her call to discount my check so heavily. Her and the guy bartender said they wanted me to come back and try them again and that it would be better next time. He was a nice guy. None of my frustration was with him. I tipped him very well and said I wished he could take the full tip because the young female bartender was a disaster but I understand tip share. 

Unfortunately, I don't think I can go back to this location for a long time. It's disappointing because it's so close. However, the three experiences have been consistently horrible. Good thing Chick-fil-a and In-N-Out are across the street. Ha!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a coupon for a free pizza.... Pizza was incredible even let us have half mushrooms and didn't up charge us. Waitress was great too. Sometimes you're nervous about the service you'll get when you have a coupon, but was some of the best service I've ever got! And pizza was soooooooo good!"}
{"text":"I regularly come here. Weekly. Sometimes even daily after work. It's literally walking distance from my work.

Let's be clear. This is a pizza place. I mean, sure, they offer burgers here, wings, salads, even, but at its core, Mellow Mushroom is a pizza place. So when I look at the other reviews posted on here, especially the most critical ones that comment on the sandwich quality, I really have to ask myself: Do customers really come here expecting artisan-quality sandwiches?

I mean, just look at their tap selection. I'm pretty sure they have more than 30 beers on tap alone, not to mention their bottle selection.

I will continue to come here so long as I continue to live close by to the location."}
{"text":"It's a relatively new location in Mesa, AZ. The place looks nice and the staff are kind, but what worries me about the longevity of this location is that it's in... Well, Mesa. Mesa is sort of known in the restaurant industry as the place where restaurants die. Anyone who's been on Main St has seen the recession take the worst toll on this part of the city-- At least the placement of Mellow Mushroom is a means to get people to come out and spend more money.

The pizzas are great there, but what really impresses me is the selection of beer available. Also, the outdoor seating area here is nicer, nicer than even High Street.

I wish this location the best of luck."}
{"text":"Good spot. I think downtown tempe lacks a great food selection. Mellow offers good but not great pizza. Their happy hour is pretty good and the beer selection is top notch. Great location helps too."}
{"text":"When we went here, we got the house special pizza and the meatball hoagie. The hoagie was good and had a good amount of tomato sauce and cheese on the whole grain hoagie roll. The pizza was good also, but it didn't have that much flavor to it. The food was average. The worst thing was the speed at which we received our food. It took a both an hour to receive our food. This restaurant needs to improve on their efficiency and get the good out to customers faster. The people behind us ordered after us and got their pizza before us. The service subtracted two stars. Also, it was very loud in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Is pizza supposed to be so oily? I can't believe this company gets away with the food that is served. Been here 3 times and won't be back again. Ever. Or tell anyone to go here. I like to give any place a minimum of 3 try's,(maybe there was an off day in the kitchen, my sever was having a bad day, or the bar was not able to provide a good drink nor customer service). I am not quick to judge but when I come in again after previous negative experiences, I will write a review for sure. 

My history with pizza has never had such a low point. No actual flavor, except oil and even greaser cheese, which I don't know how is possible, but it happened, and a greasy crust, and the thing is that it was supposed to be some sort of baked potato with fixings as toppings but turned out to be a waste of my time and money. I know this particular pizza is an oil base instead of a red sauce, but seriously, I shouldn't be able to squeeze oil out of a pizza slice. Have you ever? May have well as brought out a garbage can and told me to eat out of it. There would have been more flavor at least. I don't know how they have been in business these years and I feel they are just panning to the lowest common denominator of clientele... Fail Mellow Mushroom. Absolute fail on multiple occasions"}
{"text":"Pure nastyyyyy pizza tasted like a bagel from frys!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in CLT that I've been able to find so far. Everything is made with fresh ingredients and their crust is a perfect thickness. I highly recommend getting their veggie pizza. Priced well for the quality.

P.S. Please bring back those cool lava lamps!"}
{"text":"Disappointed that they have 17 TVs that have to show one of two football games. One TV on a requested World Cup rugby game isn't asking too much. I know now not to bring my team here to watch any of the semi finals. Lighten up on the rules just a bit please."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this place for the first time. Everything was good, but nothing was great.

We enjoyed happy hour with half price apps. I had Jerk wings and BBQ wings. They were pretty good, the jerk was a really good flavor, but the wings were kinda small and over cooked. My wife had the spinach artichoke dip and it was a little dry and lack luster. Not worth ordering. We shared the house special pizza, and it wasn't very special.

The staff was friendly and helpful. The kitchen was fast and our food came out perfect. It was a good experience and glad we came here! Probably not my first choice for pizza but I will be back."}
{"text":"Good kid friendly place, friendly atmosphere, good pizza, good chicken Cesar salad.  Alcoholic beverages are not that great.  I liked the kid friendly environment and lots of TVs to keep the smaller ones entertained."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick drink whilst awaiting for friends, they have a real nice selection of drinks. Various styles of ales and also some infused brews. I tried the coffee infused blonde ale and it was a different combination of both. I m a huge coffee drinker and lover, I also do love ales and having both tastes in the same glass kinda felt different at first but tasted good! Bar tender was nice and she was good at giving advice, crowd was nice and overall atmosphere was good too."}
{"text":"We've given this place a try 4 times. Every time they've messed up our order.

We went in Sunday night for a friends birthday. They weren't our first choice but our local, independent restaurants in Lakewood we wanted to go to happened to be closed. So, the 4 of us went there. Ordered the enlightened spinach salad w/ no feta (both) and they still brought out one salad with feta. No biggie. They took it back and brought out new one. Then the pizzas came, our friends built their own, we got the Thai curry vegan, no cheese and tofu.... ours was fine, theirs had cheese. Still not the biggest deal, they remade the pizza, everything was fine. Then the bill came and they charged for feta. One mistake after another. Our server was a big sweaty dripping mess when we walked in, and both him and the manager made jokes about us bringing in our own dessert, which we didnt, it was a plastic bag with brownies, a gift for our friends house sitting our house. We weren't eating our own food there. Not a big deal, but annoying. 

The last time we ordered pizza was during the winter, a bad snow storm, and we gave in to wanting a pizza. Well, that was our first introduction to them not knowing what vegan meant. We ordered the Thai pizza \"vegan\" so they brought it with vegan cheese and chicken. It was late and we weren't driving back out for another, we called they said they would send a gift card in the mail in the same price and to come back. I just wanted a refund. After a mess up like that, I don't have a desire to go back. 

The first time we went in, their mistake was in our favor. We ordered the subs for lunch and it's suppose to be half subs and we each got a big full one.

With being vegan, however, the point is to not create the demand for animal products, by bringing out food with meat and cheese we have to send it back, and if someone in the kitchen doesn't eat it then, it goes in the trash. That's a big deal.

And aside from that, we cook all of our meals at home and don't go out often since we can usually cook it better, for less and much healthier.... , so the few times we've gone out to get something here it's been a fail. 


It's just another corporate pizza shop too. If you really want pizza, go to Angelos. If you want a vegan option, go to Humble. There are plenty of independent shops even in rocky river to choose over this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the gluten free mighty meaty and it's absolutely delicious.  The gf pizzas seem larger than other restaurants I've been too and doesn't appear to be the standard \"udi's\" crust you get at a lot of restaurants. 

The restaurant wasn't terribly busy on Saturday at 3 o'clock and we were seated and served fast.  The music wasn't loud and there were 3 college games playing on the TVs above the bar.  I love the ambiance and the restaurant was clean.  Wait staff attentive and friendly!

I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"While I like the food at Mellow Mushroom, the service is bad enough to make that not matter so much. I have found I get much better service at the bar than at a table, but it's still not stellar. Upon coming in, the five employees standing at the hostess stand made it seem like they were doing me a favor to stop their conversation and acknowledge me. I ended up going to the bar just to spite them. 

The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable about the beers, but not the wines. Also, the service was pretty slow - once I got my initial drink, it was hard to get them to look at me again. I will say the vegetarian selection are great and tasted good. The pizza is also pretty good, mainly because of the crust. The wings are lackluster and small. I ordered a cookie to take with me and it took 15 minutes for someone to bring it out. This made me think it was being baked fresh or something but it was just a cold, not-so-special cookie probably made the day before.

This place competes directly with Duckworth's so my prediction is the one with the better food and service will be the one to survive."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best in my area. Plenty of beers on tap to choose from. I don't love the pizza but the wings are the best! Try the Jerk chicken wings or the Sweet Chili wings."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The service was great and very nice. We enjoyed splitting some pretzel bits, bread sticks, salad, and pizza. The beer cheese sauce was delicious and made the pretzel bites super good. I highly recommend spending time eating and sitting in the patio seating. The weather happened to be perfect for us."}
{"text":"First time here and it was awesome. Our pizza was taking a little longer than normal but our waitress gave us cheesy bread to hold us over! When we got our food it was amazing!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place when a friend recommended it as great. We were dining rather late so there wasn't a whole lot of people there. Our waitress was excellent in directing us with our pizza choices. I ordered half mushroom and half meat lovers. I had noticed the mushroom half had no tomato sauce added. I thought that was strange. The meat portion was very good but the mushroom half was tasteless and really need some more mushrooms. I think there were at least 10 count on the whole four slices. When we got the bill I thought the price was high for a medium half and half pizza. A little over $9 for each half. The brew beer was really good. Probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"Today was a day that staff failed to remember customer service, stuck their dirty hand in the orange slices then proceeded to put it into my friend bare hand. 
Disgusting so will not be back again"}
{"text":"We have been frequent guests at varies time and the service is AMAZING!  From GM Kris,  to Mr Brandon to our server Anthony the entire staff is refreshingly helpful.  Not to mention the food is delicious, quick,  & hot!  
-Dewayne and Lisa-"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom was my absolute favorite place to get pizza in the Phoenix area. The pizza is always great (something about the crust is just awesome) and the happy hour prices and choices were great too. We've never had a bad server. I've been there with just me and a friend up to 15 people and MM never disappoints."}
{"text":"Well, it was our first time here and we left unimpressed. The pizza was good, but not great for the price. Our server was very inattentive/ preoccupied. Had to flag &ask for refills and check. No bueno.  We may or may not go back. Nothing we will be jonesin' for. Service can def kill or thrill a meal. 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Looking for a new spin on pizza? This place has \"outside the box\" spins on topping your pie. Like curry chicken and cucumber. Or jerk chicken with banana peppers. Very tasty combinations, trust me. Also very flavorful crust, which is important to me. I also very much enjoyed my spinach salad with candied pecans and feta. Would make a great date place, with a full bar and plenty of beers."}
{"text":"I have been waiting since Monday for the big opening, and finally made it over for lunch today.  They finally got their liquor license approved, so the taps will be flowing soon.  

In terms of the space, they did a nice job renovating what used to be Table Restaurant . The decor is funky and open and fun with a ginormous mushroom in the middle of the room.   

Since I was stopping in for a quick bite alone, I opted to eat at the bar.  I wanted  to order a slice (which was listed on the menu) and a small side salad, but they don't have the slices available yet. Major disappointment since I didn't want to order a 10 inch pizza.  

So, I ended up getting a hogie instead. I had the jerk chicken, which is my favorite topping (along with pineapple) on pizza at MM. The jerk chicken hogie comes with pineapple, green peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach and I had them hold the mayo & onions.  The hogie was pretty good, except for the fact that my whole wheat bread was somewhat soggy.  

When I got my tab, I was suprised to see that they charged $2.25 for a glass of soda water.  Wow, that's quite a mark up for carbonated water. (The girl who rang it up couldn't find soda water listed on the POS system, so she just entered it as a sprite... not what I would have expected, but oh well... next time I'll get a different beverage instead.) 

There were tons of employees milling around, but they seemed to be unfocused and a little unsure of themselves. I'll give them a break though since they just opened.  I think once they iron out the opening issues, I do expect that they will improve tremendously. I'll definitely be going back to check on their progress and sink my teeth into one of their delicious pies!"}
{"text":"This Mellow Mushroom typically provides a faster service than the usual Mellow Mushroom thanks to it being uptown with people usually only on an hour break to stop-in, grab a salad or pizza and go back.  My typical visit to this location is during the lunch hour, so this is a good thing; though if the place is very busy, the kitchen slows down, but that is expected.  Diners can be seated indoors and out or can opt to seat yourself at the bar.  This location offers daily lunch specials and discounts to nearby businesses (i.e. Duke Energy, Wells Fargo, etc.) on certain days.  This location also has a stamp card that offers a free meal after 8-10 visits.  Generally, service at this location is good; if mistakes happen, they will make another pizza/salad or reduce your bill.

The pizzas are fantastic, no question.  The sourdough like bread with a strong tomato sauce has a unique taste no other pizza place I've been to has replicated.  Though simple pizzas can be ordered, their menu features signature pizzas that have chicken, pesto, and a lot of other nontraditional toppings... and of course various types mushrooms.  The only negative is that the build-your-own pizza can be most expensive, so its best to order the signatures, if you see one you like (I typically get the Mighty Meaty).  Please note that they will also add Parmesan cheese on top of all their pizzas.  I don't order salads, but I have been told by friends that they are good too.

They serve Coke products at this location.  Their sweet tea is generally water-down bad, so skip it.  Full bar and a good selection of beers on tap.  

The style of the place is not as fancy as other locations, slightly spartan.  Lots of televisions around the bar area and around the restaurant.  Free Wi-Fi, when it allows you to connect.  Price is going to be higher than average, but worth it.  Overall give it four out of five; it is one of the better Mellow Mushroom around.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I always get great service here!  Atmosphere is fun and inviting.  During game days make sure to get there early."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated immediately.
The spot just opened for the day. It was not busy. There were about 7 tables occupied.
And there were 3 servers helping customers out.

Our server was attentive, and quick to take our order.
After that, it just went downhill. We waited for our food nearly 30 mins. We ordered wings, and a personal sized pizza. Once they were served to us, chicken wings were at room temp, and the pizza was slightly warmer than the wings. We had to flag our server a couple of times to refill our water. Lastly, getting our check was also as slow as getting our order.

Food is good. Service is inconsistent."}
{"text":"Bad service, pretty good food, too pricey for what it is. A calzone and a sandwich was over $24. That's ridiculous. You are paying for the 'Disneyworld of Hemp' decor. Won't go back, but the food was decent."}
{"text":"Ordered a 12\" magical mystery tour and a righteous portabello reuben. Way overpriced. 

The sandwich wasn't enough stuffed full it contained a thin layer of sauce, sauerkraut, a mushroom or two and that was it. It's almost $10 for a tiny, unsatisiying sandwich.

 The 12\" ($12) pizza was extremely thin crust, barely any sauce, cheese, and about a jalapeno and 2 tiny mushrooms per piece. 

Overall I wouldn't pay again, very little food for the huge price. The service was okay, beer was even $7 for a 20 oz draft. Total ripoff, subpar food, not a lot of amount for the price you pay. For the record I don't mind paying for food, if I'm getting my money's worth. 

The pizza was kind of lukewarm and the sandwich was cold. I will not be returning and suggest you don't go either. 

(Also, we got the groupon we came as a group of 4 we wanted 2 separate checks, most other places have let us sit at the same table and used a groupon on separate checks...not here! They wouldn't let us use it unless we sat at different tables...I mean really, isn't that the same thing you just aren't letting us sit together?)"}
{"text":"My newest, most favorite place to hangout. My fianc√© and I come here all the time and have really enjoyed getting to know some of the servers/bartenders. They're always on top of food orders and the bartenders are great for beer knowledge (especially IPA's for my fianc√©). 
We LOVE happy hour; the prices are great and after every visit we go home full and happy. 
We like the wings, Capri salad and every pizza we've tried. It's really phenomenal. 
Honorable mentions are Chris, Gene and Robert -- all who we have had the opportunity to see after their shifts at one point or another and they're great people. 
Looking for good eats and food? Worth trying. It's delicious and the service is always great!
**try the purple haze, it's yummy and popular!**"}
{"text":"Easily one my favorite pizza joints in AZ! Great beer on tap! Best happy hour ever!"}
{"text":"Horrible service for to go.... The black haired bar tender girl was beyond rude and slammed my receipt on the table after the surprise of the extremely high check. She made us wait 15 minutes to get the pizzas and then kicked us out after we sat down for 10 minutes because we weren't 21 yet. I just want to know how she's still employed here??"}
{"text":"Bottom line, the hostess was the worst. She did not great my party because she was texting on her phone. We were seated by a bartender and he was the reason I am giving this place 2 stars instead of 1. The pizza was okay and the beer selection was mediocre."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Service can be hit or miss, but always friendly. Drinks pours are average. Prices are fair for the area. I would recommend the place. Its just not one of my favorites."}
{"text":"We ended up going to this place randomly. We were starving and looking for something hardy to eat. We ordered the largest meat lovers pizza with the regular crust. Yowza! It was super good and such a huge pizza! The waiter, Rob was super helpful and suggested we hop onto Groupon for their latest deal going on $20 for $10. Spend $10 and get $20 worth of food. Nice! That's exactly what we ended up doing. We asked for vegan cheese because of dairy allergies, however, the waiter forgot. To make it up, we ended up getting a whole entire new vegan pizza. Now that's what I call great service! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was very good.  The bartenders were really nice guys.  The beer selection was also very good.  I'll definitely be back for a beer.  Nice location, you can go catch a movie after drinks. The only negative thing I have to say is its a little pricey."}
{"text":"Went to MM tonite. Did not get to try the food tho. We were seated and server did not make contact for 10 mins. When that finally happened said she would be right back for drinks. 5 mins later we called it quits when she didn't  come back. Table next to us also had not got their drinks and were seated  before us. Menus were crusty and nasty. Table was really sticky. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I tried out this placed based upon its reviews - I ordered a Large Kosmic Karma pizza (found under \"Specialty Pies\").  It was pretty good pizza, although I was a little disappointed by the amount of feta cheese on it.  I took a close-up pic and it doesn't lie - there wasn't much on there and as a result, it didn't add much flavor.  There's no question that the pizza would have been better if there had been more.  But, it was a nice combination of ingredients and the pizza tasted good otherwise.    

The issue with this location is the parking - there is none.  Mellow Mushroom is situated in a large shopping center with many business and restaurants in the vicinity; and not nearly enough parking.  I was just picking up a pizza and couldn't find a place to park.  I drove around for 15 min. and eventually just parked (illegally I think next to a dumpster) so I could run in, grab the pie and get out of there.  I'd like to try their food again, but the parking is such a nuisance, that I can't say I'll come back.  And I get that it isn't Mellow Mushroom's fault, but it does affect my decision to give them repeat business.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go to.  The title says it all, it's the most mellow environment with outstanding service, great food, happy hour, and cocktails.  This is our go to late-night spot.  The layout is really great, providing for an outside patio to be just as comfortable as the indoor dining room.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Honestly not a bad place to get some pizza. The choices they have are nice and different and they are all delicious I've been here a few times the customer service is a little off and the seating for me was terrible twice the seats were not stable nor the table. Place is okay wouldn't consider it when in this area. Try Rays Pizza just across the street!"}
{"text":"Mellow is always a nice place to go have some really good pizza and beer. Love the magic carpet ride theme and everytime I go there is a good band playing. Love the outside area and the heaters are nice. Always good food. Awesome beer selection. Anywhere that has Bells Two Hearted for $5 is awesome in my book! Love Mellow Mushroom!! Oh and the nagic mushroom soup is SO good."}
{"text":"mm mmm mmmmm! I think this is my FAVORITE pizza spot! There are special herbs, cheese and possibly some magic ingredient under the crusts. I'm not sure what it is but quite honestly, I don't think it matters! This is one of few franchises that I love. Somehow they were able to replicate the same greatness at every location, go figure! BTW, have you tried the calzones?? They're bigger than ME! ..Possibly not, but they're pretty huge. My favorite is the House Calzone with spinach, mushrooms, roma tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. I like everything I've tried except for the wings. It was an appetizer that my friend ordered.. but who comes to Mellow Mushroom for wings anyways??"}
{"text":"Family stopped by this new restaurant in the neighborhood. Good looking place. Pizza and salad was tasty. 

Ordered the jerk wings. Another family member ordered the jerk sandwich. Wings are super small and way overpriced. The jerk sandwich had double the meat compared to the wings and it was cheaper. Don't get the wings!!!! Felt like I got ripped off. 

Nice place just don't know how I feel about the value we received.

Also questioned why the bar is facing West with zero shade when you are trying to drink a beer with the sun in your eyes. The architect and design of the building is laughable. They didn't think that one through. Hopefully they get that fixed."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is my favorite pizza joint.  I travel many states and always look for one of these.  The atmosphere is always cool to look at. The bar always has local beer choices with many options to chooses from.  This is another great experience at Mellow Mushroom.  Always great!!!!!!
The street view from the bar is the best seat."}
{"text":"Just like all my other Mellow Mushroom visits this one is very good.  Service was great. Bartender very nice and local beer selection always a must on my visit. Huss Orange Blossom was my choice.  
Another great job from the Mellow Mushroom Team."}
{"text":"Pizza? Delicious. I am a huge fan of the crust. Same for the unconventional pizza toppings.

Beer? Plentiful. $6 for a pint off happy hour is a little steep but I'll roll with it.

Service? Average. I rarely make special ingredient requests, it's usually \"can I have the spicy ranch/sauce on the side instead of on the pizza\". Sometimes it comes out right, sometimes it doesn't, and sometimes the ingredient is both on the pizza and on the side. So, yeah, there is some disconnect between ordering and what comes out to you. I'll still eat the darn pizza, though.

The environment is just right for a laid back outing with a few friends or your date. A couple of brews, good food, good tunes and good conversation, you should be set."}
{"text":"Best spinach artichoke dip ever created!! It's so so good! And the pizza is great as well! However, they weren't kidding about the name. The place is extremely mellow. So don't come in expecting high-speed service and promptness. The food will come out hot and ready, but drinks and the check may take a minute! Patience is key here but it's freaking worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything awful
Atrocious service.  Waited 30 min for my first beer.  Asked waiter to see a menu and he says what do u like.  I'd like to see a beer list.  He pulls a folded up list out of his back pocket.  No silverware or napkins brought for pretzel app.  (Dry and joke size tiny cup of maranara.  Ordered pizza waited another 30 min.  The waiter sets pizza on table and does not bring plates, napkins or silverware.   We Had to chase him down inside restaurant and he said he would be right out.  (Yeah right)  with pizza getting cold I went and grabbed plates napkins and silverware myself. On top of that the pizza had ham on it which we ordered it without.   Then the waiter shows up at table 10 min later (empty beer glasses on table) and says.  Hope your doing ok and walks away.  Im angry at this point,we pay and walk out because I do not want to rehash debacle to a manager.  Thanks for ruining my once a month night out with a buddy Mello mushroom.  The 1 star is because the crust on the pizza was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Love this place and eat here often. Matt the RGM was exceptional with his outstanding customer service skills and the service is amazing and food quality is outstanding. Would definitely recommend to any and all my friends!"}
{"text":"This place just opened by my house and we love pizza but my sister worked at the one on mill & said they treat their employees horribly & has nothing but negative things to say about the company so we've been hesitant to try it. We are here now and the menu is chaotic, hard to read & cares more about being cool then delivering what they have to offer in a clear fast manor. We finally deciphered the menu we ordered 2 small pizzas. Waited 35 mins for them to come out & paid $13.00 a piece for them.... the short of it is our bill is double what We'd pay at a place where the pizza is good & I can name 10 places I'd rather eat pizza 9 of them are cheaper & all are faster. The serves was fine no problems there I actually felt bad for the servers as my sister had told me so many stories. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Pizza. There are so many stories within a pizza. This isn't just a one night fling, the pie is everything, yet it isn't. Every topping that is placed is representative of an event in your life. The sauce is consistency in every bite, just like oxygen in our everyday life. The crust represents the end, but not of our life. For a pizza is not eaten whole, but rather in slice. And just like slices have endings, there are new beginnings in life. Also they have a good happy hour after 10!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great but had to wait a long time and our server Dusti was awful. I ran out of my drink and couldn't get another one. During the hour and half we were there she visited our table 3 times, once to take our order, one to bring our salads and then once to take care of our check. Another server actually brought our Pizza. There are a lot of other Pizza places in town that have just as good of pizza but way better service. We probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Awful service the hostess was very rude and the prices are ridiculous for the quality of food. I would rather go to Streets of New York or Buffalo Wild wings."}
{"text":"Went again last week and tried the pizza. I like the fact that they have a garlic olive oil base on some of their pizzas. They really load them up with cheese which is great, but it can make things a bit mushy."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had! Lots of vegetarian options but the meatballs on the appetizer menu are also fabulous! Don't miss the beer cheese dip either!"}
{"text":"Just a nice little vegan pizza to warm the heart. Upon arrival I was ignored at the door by not only 1 but 2 employees but once discovered the seating was immediate. Note it wasnt busy I went before 3pm. I ordered a to go large pizza with vegan option of tempeh, vegan cheese, spinach, onions and mushrooms. I also order the lil spinach salad with apple, raisins, and pecans which was by far a delightful and tasty salad. My server Mason was friendly and quite helpful he was attentive and made sure that my bill was corrected following a coupon error."}
{"text":"This place deserves an applaud for their awesome gluten free pizza! It's already hard to find places that offer gluten free pizzas but when you find a place that offers it and has a super tasty crust then you've hit the jackpot! It has a fun \"pizza joint\" type atmosphere and is in a great location with friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Pros: No problem finding a place to sit at the bar.  Good temperature.  Well lit.  Nice family patriarch said thanks and slapped me on the shoulder when I held the door for them to leave, so nice clientele. 

Cons: Had the 'Mellowterranian' Pizza.  Took 20-25 minutes to make, in a nearly empty restaurant.  Was bread, a bunch of cheese, and a very small amount of chicken, olives and red pepper- Get a gyro twice as tasty, twice as healthy and half the price down the street instead.  Not worth the $13.  Bartender was weird- I think he thought I was homeless, or something.

I won't say I won't be back.. A stripper with a Ph.D. could beg to go on a date there and I would probably give it a second chance.  I'd make her pay, though."}
{"text":"Called on our way there for a party of 7 they said no wait we arrived 4 minutes later and they told us 45 min wait when I questioned t they said they just had a large party come in after I called yet they were seated with menus and ordering ... Really....so we left"}
{"text":"I love both locations of Mellow Mushroom, but this one is my new fav.

It is so refreshing to have a location closer to chandler than having to drive up to mill ave. It's fun on mill ave, but the ahwatukee store is easier to get to, way more chill, and has a great atmosphere. The place looks awesome, has movie nostalgia all over, giant sculptures of king kong and dinosaurs, it's sweet, kids would go crazy over it for sure.

The servers are chill and nice, especially this guy named Austen. He was nice, patient, and totally laid back, the guy was pronto too on everything. Water refills every second, courtesy, all that jazz. I hope the manager of this location is reading this, because Austen is the man and deserves a bonus, for real.

Capri is good, hummus is good, the grub is good! no doubt about it. Big, long, beer selection guarantees a good night out!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza with quite a selection of specialty toppings.  We had the buffalo pizza and it was delicious!  We got in right before the supper time rush and the wait staff were friendly.  They have some large u-shaped booths that would be good for big parties.  The decorations and bright colors are fun and on the verge of psychedelic.

This place was a bit more kid friendly than I anticipated.  I almost felt like I was at a Chucky Cheeses because practically every table had 2 or more small children.  And don't even try getting a table on the magic mushroom bus in the middle of the dining area because it's packed with kids.  Not that I'm anti-kids, I just felt out of place without any little people at our table.

They have a large outdoor patio that looks nice but unfortunately it was too cold to go outside during our visit.  We will be back, but maybe at a later hour for a more adult dinner."}
{"text":"My first time to Mellow Mushroom and I was very happy with the experience. Great beer selection, the salads were fresh, and the pizza was top notch. I consider myself a fan. I will return."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. Our first visit shortly after it opened was perfect! Their S'Mores nitro was delicious and perfectly poured, the pizza was cooked evenly and loaded with tasty topping, hummus and pretzel bites spot on.  The next visit was not so great. The beers were bitter and my pizza was burned on the bottom. The other's at my table were fine though so maybe it was a one off. I will give the place another chance to live up to the first visit, but it seems like they may have a lot to iron out. On the plus side the atmosphere is fun with unique architecture and sculptures the seating is extremely comfortable and makes you want to stay forever."}
{"text":"I used to love Mellow Mushroom, but now they are massively over priced and the food sucks!  They used to serve amazing beer cheese with their pretzels, but now it's a lumpy cold crappy cheese served in a tiny condiment cup that they have the nerve to charge $3.89 for. The wings have no flavor and you have to request ranch or blue cheese or they don't bring anything.  Salads are wilted with barely any dressing. The pizza was burned and hard as a rock!  Unbelievably over priced crap!"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible. Took forever for our mini pizzas to get to us and when they arrived, it was nothing special. The staff barely pays attention to you; we were there for 2 hours (45 minutes spent waiting on those pizzas) and I think she came by only twice.  We had to flag her down where she was standing across the bar hugging on some other dude (employee or customer, idk) just to get our bill.  Truly another disappointing experience. I've been to this location 4 times and it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Follow up review- still awesome!!  amazing pizza and salad, amazing boutique beers - what else need be said!!!"}
{"text":"This is the third location in the valley in my opinion the best!! Great location, decor and atmosphere, and of course, great pizza and salads. Finally Phoenix is getting some character- highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The cheese pizza is good, but  even better when I add Jerk Chicken and Pineapple... yum, yum!   This \"shroom doesn't have the best selection of beer in town, but they have great service so it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Went again new years eve.Half packed(not real busy at all 6.30pm) .Really slow again 45 minutes for a 4 slice pizza.Beer selection and Pizza Yummy.Call in your order ahead of time or go planning to drink for awhile,on that note would have gave two more stars."}
{"text":"I went and I was greatly disapointed. I had a simple 14\" mushroom, onion and cheese pizza . It was barely 4 sliced mushrooms on the entire thing! The crust though different was not that great either. Beverages are all totally overpiced. I'm a fan of hard ciders especially Hornsby's cider. One bottle here is only .50 cheaper than a 6 pack. My simple pizza was just shy of $18!!  The host at the door just let me walk in and take a seat. she seated everyone else. I set for 7 minutes until my waiter came and then he got me a menu.   There's a survey you can take on your reciept that gives you $5 off your next visit. I wish I could just have my evening back and my money. I brought half the pizza home which was my plan to tkae it for lunch tomorrow. Nope I will wreck my 30 min lunch break with this crap!   I was hoping a homeless or street person would approach me and I could give it away, but none did."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time! We will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Made a quick stop into this place before the ASU game with my date who was dressed like a hooker and flirting with any live male body in site. We later parted ways at the game during the fourth quarter. I have been to Mellow in the midwest before and I'm a huge fan of the pretzels here. They were still pretty good in this west coast location, but the extra purchase of the beer cheese for dipping was clearly the key. Beer was a bit pricey for a college town, but they do have a huge number of draft choices. Go for the pretzels and cheese, excellent drinking food."}
{"text":"Went for late lunch (1p) on a recent Monday. Not crowded at all...but it took 20 minutes for our spinach/artichoke APPETIZER! Waaaay too long! But the app was really good. 

For lunch I ordered the Mushroom Club (Ham, turkey, Applewood smoked bacon, Provolone or Swiss, caramelized onions, grilled mushrooms, mayo, lettuce and Roma tomatoes, topped with sprouts). That's the way it's described on the menu. 

WHAT I GOT was a lot of hoagie bread, raw, cold mushrooms on top as an afterthought and no sprouts! I was too occupied with my lunch meeting to bother saying something to our server. I didn't want them to remake it. Hell, it already took too long for the first one. I just wanted to eat it and get back to the office. Not only was the hoagie not served as described, it was dry and the tomatoes were watery. Not a great experience for my first experience."}
{"text":"There was a baby spider in my chicken!!!!!! It was still alive just crawling around. The reason they got two stars is because the waiter was nice.... But it was my first time and I was mortified and the menu is also limited no desserts."}
{"text":"Eating out to me is mostly about customer service. The food is important of course but nothing is better than restaurants that make you feel right at home. Managers that treat you with respect and a waitress that knows how to be courteous and kind. Thank you Mike and Paige for making my experience here unforgettable. Getting to know people like you is very refreshing."}
{"text":"We celebrated a friend's birthday here on a soggy Saturday evening. We chose the deserted patio section since it was rather nice out despite a little haboob that passed by earlier in the afternoon. The inside was pretty well laid out with the bar area taking center stage with lots of LCD TVs above it--great for watching sports. The bar area also opens up on the patio side which I thought was a nice touch. There were a large variety of beers on tap with a good selection of local brews that rotate. 

To start, we ordered their pretzels with cheese sauce. The bread looked like it was wheat but had a creat chewy/crisp texture. The sauce was excellent as well. For the pies, we got the pesto and buffalo chicken. For a group of 5 we ordered two mediums and that was plenty for us..with leftovers! The chicken on the buffalo chicken pizza was a little bland, but the pesto was my favorite. I'll have to try some of their other specialty pizzas next time. 

Prices were a little high in my opinion but with a groupon, it was a good deal for us. I might try their happy hour next time I'm up near this location."}
{"text":"House special. This is the pizza I get EVERY TIME & almost every time it is perfect, sometimes it's not.

Getting it to go is way better than eating it there.  While I love the decor inside, the staff is just OK. We've had to wait a long time to even get our pizza. However, any time we've ordered it to go, it's ready & waiting for us, after the 15 minute trip over there to pick it up. The inside service is pretty slow, even if they aren't busy.

So for the pizza itself...it's yummy. The slices are huge & mama mia, the toppings are plentiful (which I love).  Again, sometimes the pizza is better than other times.

Families LOVE this location, so if you don't like kids, you're best to get your order to go.

Like Nicole, I've been to plenty locations, really almost every one in NC.  Charlotte though has some catching up to do to be on the level of the other locations."}
{"text":"We went there when it first opened. The service was not good. The pizza was great. Our pizza fell off the stand and into the floor and our server told us to BUY another one! No thanks, it fell off right after he put it on there. The second time was GREAT! We sat at the bar and had a blast! The bartenders were so fun! I called to have a giant birthday party there. They don't take reservations... okay I understand. They told us good luck and the wait for our large party was going to close to an hour and a half on a Saturday night. I was so disappointed in them loosing our money! The parties bill at Revolution Pizza was very large with pizza and beer for hours! The manager was so rude about the whole situation. He told me I must not understand the restaurant business. Funny thing is I worked in a restaurant for a long time! Sad really. We now take our business to Revolution and if we want The Mellow we will trip it up to Asheville!"}
{"text":"Mellow isn't the best pizza in town, but if you're looking for some decent pizza choices in a \"sit-down\" atmosphere then you really can't go wrong. Kind of an oddball location for Ballantyne Commons, but seems to be flourishing rather well. 

This placed is slammed from being in the \"burbs.\" Venture in on a Friday evening or any mealtime hour on the weekend and....well, let's just say that you'll have fun holding your pager whilst waiting for your table to clear. 

Not too impressed with their pizza. The mega veggie and white pizza are really flavorful but every time I've been, you have to \"fork and knife\" the pie. A little too flimsy to hold and very, very, very, very greasy. I can appreciate a good fork and knife pie, but typically when its going to be Chicago style. 

Great beer choices. Love that they have some great micro, craft and macro brews on draught. The bar is perfect to squeeze into if you're looking to grab a quick meal and brew with your wife, buddy or if you're flying solo. 

The place is decorated to the gills in vibrant hippy art. If you're into that....you might as well fill out an application. 

Service is always friendly and fast. Never had any problems or negative experiences in the few times I've been. 

Definitely order the pretzels (pizza dough inspired). They are TO DIE FOR. 

Also, the spinach artichoke dip is the best my wife and I have ever had. 

Caprese is always a standard choice. 

If you're headed there for pizza, you really can't go wrong with any choices. Just heed my previous comment. If you choose not to fork and knife your slice, you'll probably end up wearing it. 

Definitely worth a try if you haven't had the Mellow experience yet."}
{"text":"I was super excited when we got a Mellow Mushroom in the greater CLE area.  I've ben to other locations in Raleigh and in Southern Ohio and I've never been disappointed.

The fam & the man decided to check it out on a Monday and avoid the crows at Angelo's.  I was glad we did.  This place was wide open for seating at 5:30 pm.  Because I beat the fam / man, I had a beer at the bar.  A wide selection of taps for the choosing and they had my favorite on tap, Rogue Dead Guy.  MM is already a winner in my book just for that alone!  They have a nice indoor / outdoor seating area along the bar which I think might be fun on a weekend.

Our server was great and was appropriately attentive and informative.  We ordered 3 pies and mixed & matched so we could maximize our MM experience.  They were all very good and I was pumped to have left-overs to take home! 

I noted that the other reviews are mixed from great experiences to poor.  While some of this may be due to the newness of the place, I think others are just perhaps unrealistic expectations.  Look people, a good pie takes a while.  If you want your 'za in 10 minutes, go to Pizza Hut.  This stuff is hand-crafted, hand tossed, and has to be prepared appropriately.  This stuff is mostly made-to-order and it takes time.  If you're in a hurry hit up some fast-food people.  Be happy you're not in the CHI where it takes 45 min for 1 pie.  

I had a great experience, and while I don't think your decision on the MM should solely be based on mine, I would return and check this place out again.  Quality product for reasonable prices.  I was a happy camper."}
{"text":"Yay we have a Mellow Mushroom. Mellow Mushroom was one of my favorite hangouts in Raleigh so I was stoked to find out one had opened here. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the fact that they don't take reservations..we had a large group of fourteen people and we did end up waiting almost an hour and 1/2 for a table. Luckily this place has a great selection of beer and a nice bar area. What really made up for our long wait and a bunch of cranky hungry adults was our waiter Tom I honestly don't think I have had this good of service in years. 

Tom put in our appetizers right away made sure we all had drinks split our checks a million different ways and trusted us with the gratuity. Even though seating is first come first serve they have really large tables that can seat at least 14 people together and its a great place for large groups. 

Now for the food. I've eat-in at other Mellow Mushrooms and the food has always been pretty good - I don't know if I was starving our what but my pizza was awesome. I had the red skin potato pizza it tasted like potato skins on bread it was amazing and I could only it one piece it was huge. OR maybe it was the pretzel appetizer that I was full from. All in all check this place out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not in the Selwyn area much, but when I am I'm typically there for Mellow. I've stopped in here on several occasions for a beer at the bar, dinner with a group of 12 people and lunch with friends. Each time has been a pleasurable experience. 

The staff does an exemplary job of seating, serving and managing the entire dining room. I've always loved the personalities of each staff member. Very easy to connect and they make the meal fun. Fast and easy. 

Draft beers aplenty at this establishment, folks. There are tons of local brews to choose from. My favorite? Abita root beer. Though there are not free refills, it is the best experience watching a frosty mug filled with delicious root beer on draught. Just a cool novelty to go along with your 'za!

The food, I mean....come on. It's pizzza. What's not to love? The crust is a bit darker and wheaty than others. A little heartier and stands up to loads of toppings with ease. The calzones, salads and sandwiches are great, too. Calzones are big enough to split for two people, or one ambitiously hungry diner. Everything was great. Also, splitting a large between two people always garners two slices to be taken home. A note for those who like leftovers: reheat in the oven. The microwave will kill that delicious crust!

Glad to have MM in Selwyn. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Mellow Mushroom for the first time since I read some good reviews. HORRIBLE SERVICE. Went there on Saturday night. Took a little bit for us to be served on the patio, no big deal. Server brought us our drinks and took our order. Didn't see the server for a while but he came back and checked on us then disappeared. We started wondering where our food was when people sat after us had received their food. It had almost been an hour since we ordered so we found our server and asked if we could just pay for our drinks and go. He said he was just wondering about our food and said they had put onions on our order and there wasn't supposed to be. The manager said they'd comp our food and one of the items was at the window ready.  We ordered 10 wings, a small pizza and a calzone, nothing special. The order that was ready could have been sitting the 30-45 minutes for all we knew. We paid for our drinks and left because we were going to be late for our other plans if we hadn't. It doesn't make sense why the server didn't come tell us about the mess up with our order and we weren't rude to him at all for the two times we saw him in an hour. Just horrible service all together."}
{"text":"Went Sunday at 1pm half tables were empty.  Ordered food and after 45 minutes we asked waitress to check on our order.  Fifteen minutes later, we got our salad, pizza and two calzones.  My pizza was cold -- seems like it was made first and kept under warming light.  Calzones were ok.  Not impressed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's my second time here, service was awful the first time but the food was great so I decided to come back with a friend of mine. We were seated immediately however we waited a long time for our server to introduce himself and take our drink order. We were also ready to order our food. He took our drink order and ran off, never got a chance to order. Again it took a long time for him to return. When he dropped off our drinks he ran off and said he would be right back. After waiting a while he still had not returned. We got up and went across the street to Zipps."}
{"text":"Went looking for a \"better than Waffle House \" experience late Saturday night in Ballantyne and didn't want the usual Hickory Tavern fare.  So we called ahead to MM and they said the kitchen closes at 1pm.
Our hostess sat us at a booth away from the bar/band scene and gave us all the menus.  Our waiter came up shortly after and took our beverage order.
Upon his return we began asking some questions about the food; at that point he told us we could only order pizza and calzones!  And I work for a pizza calzone manufacturer, And I was drooling over a hoagie!  So my wife ordered a small pie for her and I had wings.
We did realize that the prices were pretty high for pies.  Food came out fairly quickly.  The Jerk style wing flavor was very good; some of the best I've ever had since cooking with Jamaicans before. My wife enjoyed her pie as well, though don't care for the sweet oily style of crust.
Our waiter was attentive and friendly.  The band was great that night. But we are still looking for that go to place in our area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to visit Charlotte on vacation and heard good reviews about the mellow mushroom. We were very confused by the trippy atmosphere. We ordered pizza, salad and soup. The pizza was not cooked and the soup smelt absolutely horrible. We left and would not recommend or ever go back."}
{"text":"Food is good as any other Mellow Mushroom and service was average but this place is crazy noisy."}
{"text":"Minus 1 star for the extra long wait for our food.  4 stars for the food quality  and friendly service."}
{"text":"First visit...Had lunch here today - used my Groupon.  

We ordered the Bruschetta, Pretzels and Steak & Cheese Calzone.

-We both thought there was WAY too much Balsamic used.  Also, we expected mozzarella cheese - not Feta.

-We tried the butter and salt pretzel & cinnamon sugar with honey pretzel.  They were okay. They should have kept the honey on the side like they did for the mustard.

-The calzone was good. We liked the dough and it was fairly well filled/stuffed.

Overall, we thought it was average as far as the food is concerned - and a little pricey for quality and portions.

We have another Groupon to use so maybe we'll try a pizza for the next one."}
{"text":"Solid food with a pretty awesome drink selection. Hit this place up if you want to have a ton of tasty carbs under your belt!"}
{"text":"For a while this was our go to place, specially after 10pm. They close pretty late and it is always packed! The pizza is really good the dough is a bit sweet and they have pretzels with the same dough. We love the reverse happy hour which starts at 10 and they have half off all appetizers which are all very delicious. We love all of their appetizers they did get rid of our favorite which was the portabello mushroom."}
{"text":"I got a groupon for this and took a friend. The mushroom soup came out in this great huge bowl but probably only had 3/4 of a cup of soup in bottom. The cesar salad had little dressing on it and margarita was certainly not the best. Also had \"prime rib\" hoagie (prime rib seemed days old & dry) and again not enough dressing (mayo) on sandwich. All in all, wont go here again. Just far from special."}
{"text":"When you talk about pizza you have to talk about 2 categories: down & dirty pizzaria style and fancy pants pizza restaurant style. Mellow Mushroom takes a swing at the latter category and knocks it completely out of the park.

We were here on a Saturday for lunch and had no trouble getting seated (although we might haveif we wanted to wait for the patio). We immediately perused the impressive  beer list and settled on a pitcher of Highland Gaelic. The bf ordered some garlic cheese bread while we decided on pizzas and for this I am indebted to him. So cheesy, so garlic-y, so delicious (esp. once we added red pepper flake that was sitting on the table). You must eat it, okay?

I went with the Philosopher's Pie (steak, portabellos, artichoke hearts, kalamata olives, provolone, feta & mozzarella on oil & garlic sauce). The mushroom slices were large and firm and the brine from the hearts and olives was in no way overwhelming. At one point while eating my eyes may have rolled back in my head in delight, just maybe. He went with the house special sans olives (pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, onions, green peppers mushrooms, roma tomatoes, ham, bacon and extra cheese). As far as supreme pizza combos go this is apparently as supreme as they get.

We left feeling OH SO fat & sassy and with half of each pie in a box, so head somewhere else if you are just a bit peckish...unless you want to eat leftovers for the next 2 days. I'd just like to throw in here at the end that there was a bit of a discrepancy in the sturdiness of their supplies. I swooned over the heavy pizza servers and thick glass pitchers but those had to have been the saddest metal forks I have ever seen. Oh well, had the fork failed me I would have Jersey folded that baby up because I wasnt missing out on a bite."}
{"text":"I honestly would go for all the different types of beer alone but it doesn't hurt that food is fantastic as well!!"}
{"text":"The most recent time I went to Mellow Mushroom, the kitchen put the wrong topping on my pizza. They offered to remake it with the correct topping (avocado).  I said no that's ok, and the waitress offered to bring a side of avocado and suggested that the pizza would be comped. Well, the side of avocado never came out, and when we received the bill, she informed me the pizza was half off (not comped). On top of that, the bill reflected the extra $1.49 for the avocado (that I never ate)."}
{"text":"Fast service and good food but a bit expensive. Not as good as pizza from back home in New Jersey but still good. Our server Alexis was amazing and super attentive. I would come back."}
{"text":"The service here is abysmal.

Although the food is pretty good, though on the pricey side for  a specialty pizza (~$26), the service level experienced is beyond atrocious. 

Our visit occurred on a mid-week evening. Not busy at all (in fact nearly all of the non-booth center area tables were empty). We were promptly seated but then the wheels fell off. 12+ minutes waiting for our server to finally show up and ask for a drink order.  It got worse after that. Some examples: server no where to be found to refill or ask if we wanted another round; observed him chatting with friends nearby without regard or even a glance over at his few tables; clearing our plates without asking if we were even finished, rushing out the check taking it back while waiting and then taking the paid tab while we were still seated!

Hey Brandon or Brendan, have some class. You were rude, classless and unprofessional. 

The lack of training throughout the front of house wait staff is clearly evident at this location. This was our second time at this location and the service was even worse than opening week. 

Outside of the service, the smallwares are exceptionally cheap. For $26 for a specialty pizza, I would expect it to be served on a decent plate with decent silverware. The stuff used here is the cheapest plastic plates and ultra thin table ware. 

Like I said, the pizza and other food we had is pretty good, but the service level makes sure you don't enjoy the food or the experience."}
{"text":"Food is gross. Service is bad. Weird place. Bad location. Took forever to make our food. Sprayed bleach around the food and smelled horrible. I hate this place."}
{"text":"Very friendly attentive service. Pretzel app was quite good and made to order so it was warm and delicious. Love mushrooms so got the holy shiitake mushroom pie. Did not disappoint. We ordered some marinara sauce to dip. On a Friday night, we were seated within 15 mins of our 6:15 arrival. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Our first visit had lack luster service and we waited 10 mins or more to be waited on but the food was great. So we decided to give it a second try. Well first off the hostess tried seating us right behind the 6 people at the outside bar while there were 8 empty tables outside that were directly ass level with the bar patrons. Then we sat for 20 mins with no one even acknowledging we were even there. So when we left we told the hostess that no one came out and she nonchalantly said \"ummmm ok\"! Well there will be no strike 3, two and done with this joint. Many other pizza spots around."}
{"text":"Everything for the happy hour. The best happy hour prices anywhere, truly. 1/2 off the entire bar.. what? Half off appetizers... what? And they have an amazing beer selection.. WHAT?? 

If you haven't checked out mellow mushroom yet, you you're missing out. The bar gets really busy really quickly, but the service is decent. 

The Bruschetta is hard as a rock and it's the dish to order if you enjoy bleeding gums. Vibe is cool. Clean too."}
{"text":"100 brews on tap ! Pizza smells amazing and clean although we are only sampling beer I already want to come back"}
{"text":"This location is my favorite by far out of all the Mellow Mushrooms I've ever been to. They always have nice servers and the food is always great. They recently changed the menu but will still let you order whatever you want (I always get Maui Wowie pizza). Me and my boyfriend were just here last week and our servers name was Eric, and he was also great. He gave us our appetizer which was the soft pretzels- (SO good by the way) for free because we had to wait awhile for them since the first batch came out burnt and he didn't want to give them to us that way."}
{"text":"Best customer service we have received today! 
The veggie pizza was delicious the cold beer was a perfect pair. 
Can't go wrong with pizza and beer! So excited I finally got pizza at a mellow MUSHROOM! Place is clean, decor is awesome 
All and all what a great experience here!!"}
{"text":"I've been in several mellow mushrooms before, but this one was located in a very classy neighborhood if I say so myself. The inside was bigger than other mellows that I have been to.

The customer service was great and it seemed to be triva night when I arrived there with my new mentor and her friends. The table behind us seemed to be regulars and that to me shows the ambiance was good.

Want my food suggestion? You absolutely need to try the red skin potato pie. I didn't like the idea of sour cream on my pizza, but it is one pizza that will change your mind!"}
{"text":"Amazing food; amazing service! They will make pretty much whatever pizza, calzone, and salad you want. I love bringing my friends here for happy hour or late nights to have a drink since they're open until 2am everyday!! They even deliver and have to-go. Love love love!!"}
{"text":"When you sit at the bar, you expect a friendly and talkative bartender. Not so much when we arrived at 5pm on a Monday. The bar was barely full, but when we sat down and our guy came over to us, we asked \"How are you?\" and he replied \"Busy\". OK. That is not how I like to be greeted, no matter if you are slammed or not. Needless to say, my husband and I were on a rare \"date night\" out after having a baby and couldn't wait to indulge in some pizza and beer. The selection of microbrews was fantastic, I must say. They even had a few selections from the Rouge brewery, which we had visited in Oregon a few years back and loved. I am in a fruity beer mood lately, so I went with the Papago Orange Blossom. Hubby went with a nutty brown Rouge (I forgot the name.) Along with the male bartender, there was also a female bartender behind the bar and she seemed a lot less frazzled than her male counterpart. As he whizzed around acting busy, she calmly rang in orders he needed into the register. She ended up taking our order since he seemed to not have one multi-tasking skill in his body. As we were ordering, I got a tweet from a friend who suggested we order the Parmesan Pretzel appetizer, so we ordered that along with the Philosopher's Pie.
The pretzels came out as a big appetizer. 3 pretzels larger than my husband's fist with cups of marinara to dip them in. They were blah to me. It was basically the pizza dough made into a pretzel with a little olive oil and lots of Parmesan cheese. I could barely eat one and then realized I'd probably have no room left for my pizza. 
When the pizza came, it was hot and looked great. It had shaved steak, portobella mushroom slices, kalamata olives and white cheese. I picked off the mushrooms because I hate mushrooms, but loved the other ingredients. It was a good pizza. My husband enjoyed it, but he too was feeling incredibly bloated and full already. 
I wasn't impressed with the lack of personality of the bartenders. My husband and I choose to sit at the bar a lot when we go out because we like to have some conversations, discuss drinks and watch some sports. If the people behind the bar can't do that well, what is the point of putting them in that position? 
The only reason I will give this place another chance is because I love the selection of beers on tap and I'd like to try some other items on the menu. Plus, the restaurant is right across the way from Harkins, where we go for movies."}
{"text":"Two words: Vastly Overpriced. 

Mellow Mushroom is hippie-chic for the trust-fund stoner. The place has a clean, bistro-ish feel, service is good (our waiter was a trainee and provided better service than many veterans), and the general ambience is pleasant. 

The food quality is on the high end of average, but the prices... just looking at the prices made me dizzy from the moment I cracked the menu open. For drink and a small portion of whatever you end up being interested in, expect to pay around $12, before tipping. Small pizzas ranged up to $13. Drinks are $3 each, some of which don't come with any refill service. 

The people aren't the problem at Mellow Mushroom, the cash-grab is. It isn't anywhere close to earning the kind of prices on the menu. 

Thumbs down. The people who work here deserve not to have to be associated with (and probably forced to answer for) the prices. 

Skip Mellow Mushroom. There's plenty of other stuff on Mill."}
{"text":"This chain has certainly spread outward from it's humble beginnings in Atlanta, and now features itself all over NC - including uptown Charlotte. This location is a bit quirky, but features everything you would expect. Rather than do a lengthy rundown of my experience (and previous experiences here), I'm just going to create a simple pro-con list to consider if you are in the area. 

The Pros: 
 - Some of the better crust in the city, if that's your thing
 - Super convenient location
 - Nice outdoor patio - great for taking you dog (which we did for bark in the park)
 - Great beer selection (~40 taps or so, tons of local choices)

The Cons:
 - Service is usually a bit slow. However, last night our waiter was on point, so I might not list this one here again
 - Decor is a bit odd. Think 70's shag carpet meets business casual. Probably wouldn't take a client here for dinner


All in all it is about what you would expect in a great location. Definitely a spot I hit up late night after a knights or Panther's game!"}
{"text":"Went to the Mellow Mushroom yesterday before the ASU game. I've been here a number of times, but decided that I needed to write a review after seeing they were only coming up as having 3 stars on Yelp. 

I have always had a positive experience when I've eaten here. They have a great beer selection and their 'House Special' pizza has to been one of my favorite pizza's I have ever had. 

If you have a craving for a delicious pizza and good micro-brews, I highly recommend you try out Mellow Mushroom. 

Warning: It is located on busy Mill Ave, so you have to feel comfortable around the college crowd."}
{"text":"Yay, Mellow Mushroom is back!  

Eating here is a really fun experience.  This one is actually a bit more fancy on the inside than the Asheville or Boone locations, but it's in a fancy part of town.  Fancy other than the mushrooms growing out of the booths and the bus parked right inside, with booths and names scratched in the paint.  

The menu is downright chatty and kind of makes me laugh.  It's got starters - oh, excuse me, \"munchies\", salads, hoagies, and of course pizzas and calzones.  All of which are customizable.  Just choose a base, a sauce, cheese, veggies, and protein.  And some of the protein is not animal based for the vegetarian crowd.  There are also several sauces to choose from, not just your standard red sauce.  You can also choose from pesto, olive oil and garlic, or barbecue.  

The quality of the ingredients is the best part.  I've never had anything from Mellow Mushroom in any city that wasn't delicious.  I'm not into fancy pizzas so I always just go for the standard pepperoni and olives.  The cheesy bread is magic, and the spinach and artichoke dip is creamy and comes with crostini for dipping.  I don't know exactly what kind of bread they use but it's really good.  

They also feature an extensive beer list to go along with their extensive list of ingredients.  Nothing goes with pizza like beer!  Get your beer and pizza (or calzone, or salad, or hoagie) at Mellow Mushroom and you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"The pizza crust is amazing here. They have plenty of inventive toppings and the ambience is what you want at a pizza place. The service was slow...very slow. It was not so busy that it could not have been normal. The food was terrific so I give it high marks."}
{"text":"We have been to Mellow Mushroom a few times and are usually happy. Today we ordered 2 small salads and a medium cheese pizza. My lettuce was wilted and mushy and the pizza tasted like it was leftover pizza. It's usually so chewy and delicious, but it tasted dry, the sauce was dry and pasty, and the cheese seemed old. Our service was wonderful as usual, but today we left disappointed :(
*update* it is now 3 hours later, and both me and my husband have upset stomachs

*update* the manager got in contact with us right away and sent us a gift in the mail. I appreciate the care and him trying to make it better. We have since gone back twice and are still fans. Make sure you get the pretzel bites with beer cheese!"}
{"text":"Ahhhh.... pizza and alcohol after trying on wedding dresses, but that's a different review. Based on previous reviews, we must've lucked out today.  Our experience was nothing like The others. 

The lunch menu has a half/half pizza special which we ordered 1/2 thai 1/2 maui both chicken with a spinach salad.  The pizza was good.  The salad was ok.  I probably wouldn't order another salad here.   They're way overpriced for what they are.   But.... the salad dressing was excellent. 

The decor is described as eclectic, which it is.  (See pics lol).  There's an outside patio but it's still a bit too warm for that.  Our server was attentive and several other employees stopped by to check on us.  I will agree that this place is expensive.  They really do have only pizza, calzones,  salad,  and a few appetizers.  And a bar.  Our bill with no drinks was 30.00 for two ppl. Not including tip.  Which is where I'd take another half start off if that was an option."}
{"text":"Love MM! Got the gluten free version of the house special tonight. While it was still tasty and had crispy crust, the crust was very thin and different from the regular MM crust I know and love. Still worth it for a tasty GF option! 

Always a fan of the Papago Orange Blossom on tap here too!"}
{"text":"We went for vegan pizza. Not crazy about what I ordered (holy shiitake pie with vegan cheese, the mushrooms were a little too chewy), though I would return to try out other options. Thank you mellow mushroom for offering vegan options!"}
{"text":"Do you have the munchies for an undisclosed reason?  Like your pizza joint with pyschadelia memorabilia and menu items that evoke memories of So-Cal, circa 1970?  Wanna eat in the magic bus?  Well, I think Mellow Mushroom might do the trick.  Despite the overly-thematic interior, I thin the latest reincarnation of Mellow Mushroom has alot of potential.

I went on a Saturday afternoon and was surprised at how family-friendly this place is (lot of little people-thanks, Sam P.).  We waited a long while for the food to arrive, but when it did-holy mackerel!!!  I ordered calzone that covered a platter plate and served with marinara sauce.  It's been a long time since I've had a good calzone and this one really hit the spot.  Real steak (not the frozen meat strips like at the grocery store), ricotta and mozzarella cheese, onions, and bell peppers.  Dios mio, I'm in love!  I ended up taking about half of it home, for which it made a gluttonous lunch the next day.

Our server was friendly, he answered several questions about the menu and made suggestions.  What was I expecting anyway...an aloof  stoner?  However, he could have been more attentive with refills and \"how is everthing?\"s, ya know. I hear they have trivia, so I will be back so the world can see how much useless knowledge I posses."}
{"text":"We thought all of that we had was fantastic, we will go back.  My one criticism is I ordered a long island ice tea, great taste but it was tiny and very over priced. I have had this drink from coast to coast and on many islands, NEVER has it been served in a tiny short glass.  Iced tea is always served in a tall glass, and like I already mentioned it was OVERpriced. All food was amazing, they have a very interesting menu."}
{"text":"great bartender"}
{"text":"To my fellow college students: This is the hidden gem of Mill. From 3-6pm or 10pm to close, drinks and apps are half off. 

I ordered a mojito and a large slice of pepperoni pizza for only $8! On happy hour their pretzel bites are only about $2.50! 

Also their pizza is great! I've ate here before and was really impressed. Their gourmet pizzas are tasty but a little pricey."}
{"text":"The funky q chicken pizza, and the red skin potatoe pie are so good! So are the pretzels!"}
{"text":"The food is to die for and the staff is awesome. I just bought a house closer to this location, so I'm sure I'll be here even more than I already am. I will ALWAYS be a Mellow fan. Also, their happy hour and reverse happy hour don't help the addiction..."}
{"text":"I have loved Mellow Mushroom since my first bite about 10 years ago. Coming down south to visit family and getting to have MM pizza has always been a very special treat since their franchises haven't made it far enough north yet. But now that I've moved to Charlotte and am less than 10 miles, I was fearful that my MM memories would be crushed. It took me about a month to finally gain the courage to go, and this location DID NOT disappoint! I'm a huge fan of the pretzels, but opted for the muffuletta bread app instead. It was delicious, and not lacking in the olive area. It came out a little colder than I would have liked, but it was tasty enough that temperature wasn't a deal breaker. Our pizza came out quickly, piping hot, and perfectly correct despite our make your own pizza order being somewhat excessive. Our server didn't complain about our lengthy order. In fact, she was impressed by my creation and even complimented us on developing a pizza that, to her, sounded \"really incredibly good!\" The crust is always the best part, chewy, flavorful, and with just the right crunch. If I had to say anything negative at all, it would be that the shrimp was overcooked; however, a pizza oven cannot really be considered the best vessel for making perfectly prepared shellfish. I'm going to have to try to forget how close this MM is for the sake of my waistline, but I can say with certainty that we will be back!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. $5 for a small lunch pizza is a great deal"}
{"text":"I came here last night with a girlfriend and we were not too happy with our waiter.  He was way too pushy and got out order wrong.  We asked for an oil based pizza with salami and several types of cheese and one side with mushrooms.  The only part of the pizza that was correct was the mushrooms. Also he kept asking me if he could refill my SmartWater bottle.  That's just weird....  I Like Mellow Mushroom, so I have to give it 4 stars but I will try to avoid this waiter or go to the Mill location instead."}
{"text":"We love the pretzel bites! The pizza and salads are great too.  The food is consistently good!  Unfortunately the sun was shining pretty bad on our table from the Western Windows and made it pretty unpleasant.  When we addressed it to the manager he didn't seem to really care and said there was nothing he could do.  Otherwise it would have been a nice night out."}
{"text":"Me an my girlfriend have been here three times, the food is outstanding! But the service is some of the worst I have ever had, with tonight being the worst! We were greeted by Corey. This is his greeting to paying customers \"wassup you wanna sit at the bar\" we tell him no we'd like a table. He says \"it's all the same service\" I again say can we just sit at a table. He then asks me if I'm gonna need a server???? I'm thinking to myself \"no I'm gonna get on the line an help the cooks prepare my food\" I have never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant before. I couldn't help but feel bad for the owners an all the investors. I doubt that kid would still be around if they knew his attitude towards paying customers. I give this place two stars for the food, it would be five if it wasn't for Corey. Who ever is doing the hiring needs to stop looking for unmotivated weed heads to fit the whole psychedelic vibe an start looking for motivated friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have never been to Mellow Mushroom for so I was excited to try it. The food was fine and  was actually quite good and the service was friendly enough but as I started paying attention to the guys tossing pizza dough I started to notice some disturbing things. First the guy dropped the pizza dough and had to bend over far enough to pick it up that it did not fall on a table top and then continued tossing it. I would have just assumed I misunderstood what I saw but then the guy I dropped the pizza dough on his bearded face ( he was lookijg up as iy fell) and then continued to toss a pizza dough. I'm not sure I can stomach eating there again because I would not want that pizza dough on my plate."}
{"text":"Ordered the mega veggie  and kosmic karma...
Kosmic karma was better than mega veggie but over all the pizza was really ordinary.... The crust was the only good part....
Our mega veggie has a piece of meat tossed into.... Might have been by accident... But watch out for all the pure vegetarians out there!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday during Happy Hour. It was slow but the minimal staff couldn't handle it. I saw a couple sit at the bar and leave after about 5 minutes of not being greeted or contacted at all. 3-4 staff off duty were hanging out at the end of the bar.
That's the bad.
The good was the pizza and the kitchen manager, David. He came to the rescue and took excellent care of us. He turned what would have been a pretty negative experience into a good one. He made up for everything the staff lacked and whipped up a great pizza! I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot. They had a good groupon online. Just make sure you order it to go this way you get a lot faster service. But overall I give it a four star because the food was excellent. Pizza is my favorite food they did a great job"}
{"text":"I'm glad to have Mellow Mushroom in my neighborhood, in a great location near a movie theater and shopping. The staff is very friendly and very efficient. The choice of craft beer on tap is excellent, and the food is consistently good. I prefer to sit at the bar, either inside or out, where you have a nice view of the sunset or a choice of TVs. Did I mention the staff? They're really nice people."}
{"text":"So, so sad to have to give this location one star..

On 6/5 around 10pm we attempted to place a to-go order with this location and was told the kitchen had closed early, due to \"complications\" with the oven, yet the restaurant was full and patrons were still waiting for food. 

On 6/7 we returned to place a to-go order, placed the order and spent an hour waiting, but never received our pizza. During the time we were waiting, there were patrons assembling pizza boxes, who admittedly stated they didn't work in the establishment, standing on the service counter dancing, and waiters groping and kissing on these guests in between running plates to customers. After we waited the 45 minutes I asked the to-go waitress to check on our order, she stated \"everything is in the oven\", the cooks then came around the corner and said \"don't take anymore orders\", by this time it was 11pm, another waiter spoke up and said \"they have already placed their order.\" After a full hour of waiting I decided the better option to get a refund and take my pizza craving elsewhere :(

In the future I'll make the drive to the Selwyn Ave. location to avoid any disappointments from this location."}
{"text":"Great pizza, really fun trivia nights!  Nice environment to hang out with friends in, have never been disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"This place has a bunch of food options. Some bar and some healthy. Dead empty during the day time. Personally, love the enlightened spinach salad with some additions. Very tasty and well portioned."}
{"text":"I've been putting off trying this place to this for ever,  just because I don't love mushrooms .. absolutely the dumbest thing I could've done.   This place has very good  PIZZA  it's different completely , they have molasses in the dough.. I don't eat crust but here I'm not leaving a bite left!   Just a wild verity of pizzas also, it's not the norm for sure,  witch kind of makes it great.  Tip the artichoke appetizer is the best ever I guarantee.  Also don't go after nine pm  it's kind of a bar atmosphere with load music and younger crowd drinking.. kind of a annoying.. they would have five star rating  but I've been four times now I only go before then, learned my lesson, other than that the atmosphere is great normally."}
{"text":"Meh. We were there on a slow day. The waitress took forever to take our drink orders. She corrected me when I pronounced bruschetta with a k sound .  (I am certain my Italian speaking friends know better.) 

Food was decent. Not stellar. Pricey. 

Beer selection was OK.

We asked for boxes to go, and she brought one box for two orders. We had to request a second box, as my daughter lives at her own house, and wanted her own food to go.

We were not in a hurry and the place was a ghost town. She brought us our check before inquiring if we wanted anything else. Yes, I wanted a second beer. She acted offended that we needed our prematurely delivered check updated. Oh, and when she brought the second beer...It was incorrect. She wanted to correct me on my order as well. Ugh.

This restaurant is right up the street, and I doubt I'll try it again. There are plenty of good restaurants around."}
{"text":"OMG, this place rocks!  Not only is the pizza fantastic, the staff is friendly and fun and the place itself is very entertaining.  Salads are good too, haven't tried anything else other than the pizza and salad because I love their pizza so much, I can't go int here and not get it ;o)"}
{"text":"The food was good (not great). The service was 1 star. Waitress put in the wrong pizza and forgot to put in my salad. When I questioned her about us getting the wrong pizza she wasn't even sure what the pizza was supposed to have on it. Our waters sat empty for way too long! I know this sounds terrible, but the server also smelled and most of the wait staff seemed to just be wandering around. It was odd.  The  one positive about the place was they actually had several choices for gluten free pizzas!!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my recent visit to Mellow Mushroom. My cycling team chose to hold the team holiday party at MM and from all accounts, everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food. We reserved the upstairs dining area and had ample, comfy seating for our 30 person team. 

At the start of the party, the team enjoyed a few appetizers, including wings, hummus and pita, and mini bruschettas. They were all consumed quickly. Our collective order included all kinds of things; my table ordered the 2 kinds of veggie pizzas and both were quite good. 

Service was decent, if a bit scattered. However, the staff did their best to match orders with tables and in the end, everyone got what they ordered.

My only criticism is that prices seemed a bit high, especially when compared against Nellos and Oreganos, the 2 other local pizza joints in the neighborhood. Personally, I believe that Nellos and Oreganos offer better value as their prices are lower than MM's and you get more food. However, I would come here again to check out the main dining room area and movie-theme decor."}
{"text":"I've been to another MM in another city so I knew what to expect. Get the Philosopher's Pie and thank me later. It's a little slice of umami. We've settled for only getting take out from this location because it's too busy all the time. The wait is silly, crowded and the dining room is loud. And there's usually lots of families there with big kids but IMO it's just not a good experience for toddlers...starting with the crowds and the wait."}
{"text":"If your looking for pepperoni pizza then don't come here.mellow mushroom offers toppings that you would only dream of putting on pizzas....almost any type of topping you can think of they will likely have"}
{"text":"There are tons of great vegetarian and vegan options here but it looks and acts like a chain. Our server was very nice and answered all my questions about how to veganize a sandwich (bottom line: Daiya cheese). But the menu is very confusing. I had to reconstruct the entire sandwich by scratch. Mid you're going to advertise how vegan friendly you are you should have a vegan menu or at least a vegan section. 

And after all that they got my order wrong (mayo was the culprit). 

How was the food? Eh. The half sandwich was giant and flavorful but super messy. The garlic cheesy bread didn't taste of garlic at all. The mushrooms out was the best thing. 

Not a place I'll go back to, which is a shame because it seems to want to do right by the veg world."}
{"text":"We have been to Mellow many more times since my initial review, I told you that I LOVE Mellow Mushroom.  The service is MUCH better than it was when this location first opened.  The food is more consistent now and has been good the last handful of time we have been.  My only complaint at this point is that they do not rotate enough drafts out and their beer club is not working.  Our beers have not been counting for the last month and a half or so.  Other than that, the restaurant as a while has improved dramatically from its first month open."}
{"text":"The only reason it's getting 1 star is because of the server who helped us and how good the pizza was. I've been to mellow many times and consistently had a decent experience. Never 5/5, but usually a 3.5-4/5. I went in for a date tonight and had a HORRIBLE experience. I brought my 7 week old puppy who's completely innocent and the manager was incredibly rude and incorrigible. I was given mixed messages, from the host and then manager. I was told my 7 week old puppy had to actually sit \"outside\" the gate alone rather than next to me. So not dog friendly. Fine. 

But I was on the phone with someone who was trying to get directions on where to go and what the situation was, and the female \"manager\" in a dude's hat and saggy pants literally, no joke, raised her hand, snapped at me as I was tending to my puppy and asked me if I was paying attention to her (while also on the phone). I was insulted and appalled by the lack of professionalism. I ate there because there wasn't much other option but the last thing I want to do is go back. I sincerely hope this gets looked at and she gets some serious coaching. Not appropriate. I'm in the service industry and I guarantee that's not the way to handle things."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Slightly too bright, spacious, ample booth and table seating as well as a reasonably sized bar. Outdoor seating. Hippie, groovy vibe with paintings reflecting a psychedelic era and a pun-ny menu to match. 

Food: We split a large pizza, half being a meat filled one and half being a mushroom garlicky one. Both were very delicious, rich, and on the heavier side. 2 slices was plenty for me. The crust was wonderful and the red sauce was tangy and robust. 

Prices were very high for a pizza. $25 bucks for a large pizza is not very reasonable in my opinion. 

Service was great. May come back, but if I'm in the mood for a good pizza, there are several other joints I would rather get pizza from on account of their competitive prices and equal quality to that of Mellow Mushroom's."}
{"text":"Pizzas are unique and delicious. Great beer selection. A few good appetizer selections too. Lacking in atmosphere but the food selections make up for it."}
{"text":"There were a ton of flies and slow service. It took them almost 10 mins just to notice we were sitting down in there section. The flies were all over the dining, prep, and cook area. Its only a matter of time before they end up in your food. We left asap."}
{"text":"The crust is so good! Our department frequently meets here after big projects and they are always on top of the orders for our huge group, with separate checks. Everything I've ever ordered has been good - big fan of the Holy shitake (though, I've asked to go easy on the extra oil and aioli before)."}
{"text":"Yummo, not sure why this place has such lackluster reviews, because the pizza was awesome and the beer list extensive! I like the location next to Desert Ridge because parking is easy and it's a nice quiet area. The pizza menu has a ton of vegetarian options, which is a big bonus.

 I absolutely love the Gourmet White pizza. The crust is amazing - thin for the pizza topping area and super thick, moist, & dense (but in a very pleasing way) for the crust portion. The flavors of this pizza are so spot on - garlicky and cheesy, exactly how it's described. I think getting the medium or large size, instead of the small or personal size, makes the proportion of thick crust better. The Kosmic Karma pizza is okay - I found the vegetable toppings to be a little lackluster...I hate when the tomato area gets all soggy which plagues this pizza, but the pesto sauce swirl is yummy.

Service is hit or miss...I've been here for work lunches where our order was taken quickly and the food came out quickly, and other times where that wasn't the case. The prices are a little bit higher than other pizza places, but Mellow Mushroom does have a higher quality of toppings and pizza combinations."}
{"text":"Ate dinner with my Mr. C Sunday night. We both ordered a hoagie and some wings. While I thought I would enjoy my portabella Ruben the sauce was too sweet for me and over powered the mushrooms. My husband enjoyed his, and the wings were pretty good. I'll know for next time not to order a hoagie in a pizza joint."}
{"text":"REALLY REALLY GOOD. fist time going and food was amazing, I love the d√©cor of the place really laid back. we went during the afternoon so it wasn't busy. I ordered the holy shitake mushroom pizza, a Cesar salad, and warm spinach and artichoke dip would definitely eat again."}
{"text":"While the pizza is pretty good this place is way overpriced. Paying $60 for one pizza, one salad,  and two drinks is absurd."}
{"text":"This is the second time I give this place a chance, done trying... Maybe at another location because I do love the food.  But the service at this place SUCKS! The girls at the front, very nice and I love the decor of the place.  We get to the table and our waitress did not know what to recommend, she gave us the same opinion about everything with no personality.  I research most places before I go and I knew of their lunch specials so I asked her and she said they had none.  So I had to pull out my phone to show her the lunch specials and all of the sudden she remembered... Hmmm.. Then food took 30-35 for lunch w an empty establishment, the food gets in and the waitress is dropping everything on our table.  The past time I went, me and my husband literally had a pizza for us and one beer each and spent $70 which to me is very pricey.  The food is AMAZING I do want to say that, the pizza dough is heaven but you gotta do more to charge that much money. It's supposed to be an experience.  That's all!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and great service make the mellow mushroom a hit in my book!! Graffiti art decor and psychedelic mushrooms art make it fun and laid back! One of the best pizza places around!! What color is your base?!"}
{"text":"I come here for the beer.  They have a great selection of beers on tap.  I am partial towards porters and stouts and what they carry satisfies my thirst.  I have only had pizza by the slice and the spinach artichoke dip on my visits, both were good but nothing special.  4 stars for the variety of beer and friendly service."}
{"text":"Good food here but the service isn't so hot. I have ordered pizza with no cheese 3 times and each of those three times I've had to wait for my pizza to be remade because it had cheese on it. They claim to cater to vegans but I spend more time waiting for my food to be remade than I do enjoying the food once it's done."}
{"text":"Great late night food!  Amazing Pabst Blue Ribbon cheese sauce and Buffalo Chicken pizza.  Atmosphere and decor is on point.  Awesome happy hour and reverse happy hour.  Music is so good!  Tool, Rage Against The Machine, 311, Rolling Stones, and Alice In Chains."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service from management. That's fine I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I want to review this location in two parts.  First, the service.  We sat down as soon as we got there which was nice.  Got our drinks and about an hour later, our pizza came out.  Waitress was not seen again.  Wanted another glass of wine but that took about 20 minutes and I did not have anything to drink during the meal because waitress never came back.  The kids meals are laughable.  The apple slices you get are about 5 or 6 razor thin apples.  (pathetic)  Then the waitress finally came by to drop off the check (of course).  Overall I was not very happy with the service.

Second, the food was very good.  They pizza had lots of cheese and a fair amount of pepperonis.  I also had a salad which was good and they give you a fair amount of dressing.  

Overall, this is a new place and I was expecting a little better experience.  

Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"We love the food but the service is lacking.  We should not wait to be asked for drinks for over 6 minutes while wait staff is standing around .  Finally the very nice bartender came over and got our drinks and food out quickly.  We have waited seriously 45 minutes for this same pizza .. Caesar pizza before.  The purpose of me writing this is to help the management notice that service is awful while the people atmosphere and food is great!"}
{"text":"Ugh. You call that pizza? I needed a glass of sand to wash it down. Adding Parmesan to the crust simply hides the fact that the crust is enormous as compared to the toppings. Service was ok...if you like staff ignoring you. Was slightly less noisy than a nascar race playing bad music during the final lap. In their defense, the bottled beer was good."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, however, the servers are given WAY too many tables that they could handle. I work in the restaraunt industry and i couldn't believe our server was running her food as well as taking care of SIX tables. Our drinks were empty a good 3/4ths of our dinner and we couldn't help but feel bad for our server and feel bad to even say anything. The young kid who appeared to be the manager was busy running around and chatting with other female workers, clearly whoever gave him the position has no idea what they are doing. He didn't seem to care about empty drinks on guests tables or the fact that his servers are in the weeds and could need help. Management of the restaurant really should be more thought out. Hire some food runners or give your servers less tables so they can be with the guests for more than just the two minute greet of the table. Food a solid 5 stars, service and management a solid 2"}
{"text":"This restaurant was listed as delivery and yet couldn't be bothered to cross the street for a man who couldn't come to them due to circumstances beyond his control.  They might've gained a loyal customer for life if they were willing to help a hungry man out with a minor request.  I didn't think traveling a couple hundred feet for a delivery was a big deal however, they didn't want my money or my business.

If they won't travel a couple of hundred feet for me I doubt I'll ever travel that far to visit one of their restaurants either.

So near and yet so far."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour and good craft beers. But they need to keep better track of their rotating taps. Every time we go in and ask what's on it takes five minutes for the person to remember. We asked why they don't have a board or list and they blew us off. Happy hour prices are good. Drinks and munchies are half off. We usually sit at the bar. The one time we sat for table service was a nightmare. The waiter disappeared and we had to go fetch him."}
{"text":"Visited here on 4-4-15. Called in order. Said it would be 30 minutes. When I arrive 20 minutes later, the say it will be another 15 minutes because they just put the order in. Decide to grab a drink at the bar. My friend and I sit down. Right after that, 2 men sit beside us. The bartenders had to pass us to get to them, which they did twice without acknowledging us. Horrible customer service, and I will not revisit this location!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with coworkers.  We were seated outside at 1pm. It took 10 minutes for someone to come out to us. We ordered by 1:11. Most of us had one topping pizza slices or just cheese pizza. The place was not crowded and it still took over 30 minutes for us to get our food. An hour later, and one coworker still doesn't have her 1 slice of CHEESE pizza. Ridiculous!!!!! Our customer service sucked today. We were offered no refills. The manager was very accommodating when I spoke to him, but it still should not have come to that.

We finally get that one slice of cheese pizza, and it's cold. Again, manager was very nice and replaced it immediately."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the food, not so much the prices and the service.  I've had such good service for quite awhile, I'd almost forgotten what it's like to get an apathetic server.  Get it together, woman!  At least act like you care.

The mighty meaty pizza was really good, full of delicious meaty toppings, and I love the crust!  Yeasty and wheaty and really delicious.  But $21.59 for a medium?  Really?  I think I blasphemed for the first time here.

Then the oven-roasted wings were very tasty as well.  Hot and crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  $10.49 for 10?  Over a buck a piece?  Second bad set of words uttered here.

They have a fantastic beer selection.  The server asked me if I wanted a glass with the bottle of beer I ordered and I declined.  My husband had ordered a beer in a can (we didn't know that at the time), and she didn't offer him a glass.  Weird.  Just a preference thing, but beer in a can tastes much better from a glass.  No tinny overtones.  We each had 2 beers and all were $6.50 each except for the Belgian beer in a can that was $5.50.  All in it was $61.82 after tax, before tip.  Blaspheming continued here.

Our server was really almost nonexistent and not engaged with us as far as talking about the food and beers and even said she doesn't bother to learn the beer list because it changes so much.  

Next time we'll try happy hour so we can afford to eat and drink here, and we'll sit at the bar to maybe get good service.  The place is huge and I like the eclectic d√©cor all over the place.  The outdoor patio and bar seating looked very inviting too.  Maybe we'll have a better experience the next time around.

**Update.  After hearing from the owner just a short time after I posted my review, I'm going to add a star.  I am completely impressed with a business owner that can approach a less-than stellar review with good questions and feedback.  That makes a huge difference."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place -5 stars, some jerk acted like he was with me and tried to stick me and my fiance with his bill of 2 drinks.  When we were ready to close our tab,  the guy at the bar questioned us who was paying for the other guys drinks, we told him we had no idea who he was. He threatened me he was going to trespass me... for what...I didn't even do anything,  I had 1 drink that they hardly put any alcohol in it...I ordered a \"dirty shirley\" he asked if I wanted grenadine in it... really... you don't even know how to make a simple drink...a Shirley Temple with Vodka in it, and I had to ask for the cherry. Talk about a lousy bartender, I've never been told I'd be trespassed from a place before, the bartender was obviously all talk, but because of this I'll never go back to this location, or probably any mellow mushroom for that matter."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try for lunch as we were looking for some place different as we were downtown checking out the half Marathon.  We were excited to hear that they had 40+ beers on tap, but the price of beer was pretty high, $6.00.  We then ordered garlic bread which I hate to say but it was the equivalent of cardboard. The sauce on the side was decent but the bread is something they should be embarrassed about.  We then ordered a cheese pizza for the table.  Ehhhh, is all I can say about it. I kept wishing we went some where else and felt bad that I thought this place would work for us. A

Another odd thing I thought was they said they don't do refills on Root Beer.  

To sum it up, overpriced, food is very under whelming and service was Ok."}
{"text":"Lovely, friendly, competent server.  We had three medium pizzas, an order of pretzel rolls, 5 glasses of wine, four sodas, one iced tea.......$120.00 before tip!  Are you kidding me?  The pleasure of a nice, competent server was not worth the cost.  Pizza?   Okay, nothing special."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Mellow Mushroom.  The food was okay.  Nothing special. The servers were mostly new and need more training.  I lost count of how many instances where the server forgot our order or brought incomplete orders.  The bartender was very nice   I may consider going to the bar.  I will not likely go back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This location has no consideration of people's time. Waiting over 20 minutes for two salads to go that were called in 45 minutes ago. This is the second to go order that was either wrong or had to wait a ridiculous amount of time. This location is the worst in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Went here the day after they opened. It looked great and the food was on par with the other location I'd been to before, so no early stage growing pains on that front. 

The pizzas are pretty good, if not slightly over priced, but you're paying a bit for the atmosphere instead of a hole in the wall type joint. 

The staff was attentive, maybe too much so since they just opened, but that can't be a ding against them. I'd rather have too much instead of too little. 

Love there beer selection and the rotating tap is a great reason to go back often. 

I'm glad to see a business give City North a go. I live nearby and hope this place is a catalyst for other businesses to come in and get the place off the ground."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great staff and bartenders. Awesome happy hour with 1/2 off all appetizers and drinks, it's unbeatable!"}
{"text":"We tried out this location on Memorial Day, around 2 p.m.  When we walked in we were not greeted by a hostess, but I think she was trying to corral a couple of families with a herd of small children and find them a couple of tables.  Personally, I'd find them tables at Village Inn but that's just me.  :-0  Oh yeah.  So my husband and I sat at the bar and waited and waited for someone to take our drink order.

We're pretty patient and there are several big TVs over the bar to hold our attention, so we didn't mind hanging out for a minute, but it got to be kind of nuts when 2 employees walked by us repeatedly and didn't even acknowledge our presence.  Alright.  That's when I start the staring game.  I finally caught the eye of a server who had popped behind the bar to help out and she asked me what I'd like to drink and darted away to get it.  My husband is sitting there like, \"what the heck?\" and I said \"You're not playing the staring game well enough\".  

She brought back my beer and almost ran off again, but he caught her attention and ordered his beer.  I enjoyed my Lagunitas Pils ($7.50 - 20 oz.) very much and he ordered something called Huss the Husstler (also $7.50 - 20 oz), which is a nice stout.  

We had asked some people next to us if they were finished with their menu and looked it over.  And then I started round 2 of the staring game so we could order some pizza.  We've had the Mighty Meaty before at the Ahwatukee location and wanted to get that again, and the Maui Wowie sounded interesting, so we decided on a medium 1/2 and 1/2 ($21.79).  The bartender let us know that the pizzas were kind of backed up and it would take about 40 minutes.  That was fine.  And I saw food coming out of the kitchen steadily so I know they were cranking away at it back there.

I don't think it actually took that long and we had our delicious pizza.  I love their crust and the toppings are always plentiful and fresh.  That is never an issue and we'll definitely be back for the food and beer.  But the service has been almost painful every time we've been to a Mellow Mushroom and on this visit the bar was littered with dirty glasses, napkins, and plates that never got removed the entire hour+ we were there.  If they got the service to be rockin' and rollin', this place would be a force to be reckoned with on the restaurant scene.  The food and beer selection is 5 stars and the locations have a fun, funky decor.  We'll be back, and hopefully won't need to play the staring game."}
{"text":"Definitely in the top 20 pizza's I have ever had and top 5 in AZ area. I was in a large party that ordered 5 different pizzas and it was decided that the best pizza was the Holy Shiitake Pie. It was tremendous! The decor was cute and fun. The waiter was fun but the staff could be trained in a more professional way. So many things were forgotten by the waiter. Another downside is that my salad ended up costing me $10 (create your own menu) My bill was $40 with one beer. That was shockingly expensive for a pizza place. Despite the sticker shock I would go back if I happened to be in the area."}
{"text":"We sat at a table in the bar area and no one came. As we were leaving I told Matt the bartender that no one came and he said it was bar service only. I said he missed out on a large tip and he held up a peace sign to me. They don't appreciate your business here, especially Matt. Very unfortunate because I've been here many times, but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Extreeeemely slow. Crappy attitudes. Lazy food servers. The food was nothing impressive. Fast food at McDonalds is better in comparison. Save yourself time and wasting your money on crappy food. Seriously, you might as well get a frozen pizza. Inviting name and cool looking place, besides that, I have no idea how this place makes money. I will never ever go back to this place. It's just pitiful. 

This is my first review on yelp. This place was that terrible, I just had to share..."}
{"text":"So I've had mellow mushroom before and it was pretty good but...tonight was ridiculous! We sat at the bar where it took forever to be served and after being served we asked for forks and the server gave us a nasty look like how dare we ask for forks...they barely followed up with us to get us another beer...then our wings came and they were not good and so we o dered pizza in hopes it would be better than the wings and it came out half cooked! Overall never going to mellow mushroom again"}
{"text":"I have been here at least a few times mainly due to their wonderful reverse happy hour where most of the beers on their list are half priced. Just keep in mind that there are some beers that are not included in this happy hour but they do have a fairly extensive beer list so there's something good for everyone. This is one of the few places on Mill Ave that have reverse happy hour making this a great spot for a night out or to at least have on the rotation of places to go.

As far as the food is concerned I did share a pizza with a friend of mine and we found it to be just okay. I was more impressed with their pretzels, mainly the garlic butter + parmesan version. I feel the main draw to this place has to be both of their happy hours and at least their pretzels for the appetizers. Their garlic bread is something I would have to try on my next visit to see how that is.

Yes it can get busy here late at night but I suppose the vibe all depends on when you go. Despite it being busy here at times the atmosphere is for the most part \"mellow\" and this is a great place to hang out and have a beer."}
{"text":"Let us just start this with the name and the location.
Mellow Mushroom on High Street. I do not think they could of planned it better.
I feel like I am in Seattle or Oregon because,it is just that type of feel.
I would say that this is more for the younger, higher crowd. 
Old Guys like me who have never gone down that path can find the humor for sure.

So besides the great name and location, nice music, fun to be there.
TV's are all around and loud.  I cannot say that I am excited by the food. The Pizza is just OK.  It took a long time to get it. But, you never know until you try it right!

It is not bad ,it is just not great."}
{"text":"Ohhh my gosh, we came here after a long day at the pool and I must say, their pizza 100% hit the spot and was so tasty! It was pretty rich {very cheesy!} and each slice weighed about 10lbs {slight exaggeration but seriously!}. The crust was doughy and chewy {my favorite} and covered in delicious spices. We ordered the Maui Wowie + Gourmet White and both were phenomenal. I am usually not a fan of Hawaiian pizza but this one was different - a must try. 

The only downfall was that my tummy was quite upset afterwards and the next day but that is totally due to eating clean and then indulging in a mega rich, greasy pizza. But I still enjoyed every bite and it was totally worth it. I would come back for sure! Now back on to the green smoothies.... ;)"}
{"text":"Slow service, the server gave us a dirty high chairs, it has lots of crumbs on it.
Didn't try the pizza, I just ordered the Parmesan pretzels , they're pretty good !!
We will try the pizza next time.
Wish the server was more attentive and please clean the high chairs before and after  each use!"}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic. Service is marginal. Kid friendly interactive tables upstairs rarely work properly. 

Kitchen is ridiculously slow but if you've got time and patience for a forgetful staff the za is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the closest bars/restaurants to me and I always forget to go here.  They have great beer selection and a great pizza menu to back it up, but they also have options if you aren't feeling in the pizza mood.  I think I order their sandwiches more than anything.

I've never sat in the bus since the place can get swarming with kids at times.  The bar area is nice.

The place gets crowded at times but aside from a wait for a table I've never had problems with service."}
{"text":"We first went to Mellow Mushroom in Kennesaw, GA.  The City North location is much larger and has a more urban vibe.  We ordered 2 different pizzas- both were excellent.  Their draft beer selection was great as well.  Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 7:30.  Very loud.  Cannot carry on a conversation with my family.  Atmosphere reminds me of BW3.  Ordered drinks, soup and a pizza.  Drinks came out, so did soup.  Kept waiting for pizza to come.  After waiting TWO hours for pizza to be served, and our waitress not having any good explanation of why we were not served, I git up and asked the receptionist for the manager.  We wanted to leave.  After such abysmal service, they still handed us a check for drinks and soup.  Never going back.  Avoid this pizza joint and go down the street to Dewey's."}
{"text":"I've been to this Mellow Mushroom on many occasions and I figure it's time to give my thoughts. When you walk in you'll notice that this isn't your normal pizza place, the art decor is very eclectic and dated but it makes the place interesting. The customer service and staff seem to be on point but it can be hit or miss at this location because sometimes our orders come out right and sometimes we just end up with another bad experience because they didn't listen to our order. The time it takes to get the order is about average, there have been occasions  when the food is on time and others where it's disappeared into a blackhole and I have to constantly ask when will our food be ready. 

The taste of the pizzas are decent but I'm comparing the taste to mom and pops pizza parlors where they know what they're doing and that's what they specialize in. The menu is very large because Mellow Mushroom tries to cover all their bases from burgers, calzones, hoagies and pizza and also there's a bar if you decide to just hang out. For me, it's too many choices and I don't think there's one thing Mellow Mushroom does extremely well. I prefer to stick with a normal pizza but you can order something off the wall funky if you choose and it'll probably be the best pizza you've ever had. 

Mellow Mushroom, as other reviewers say is an interesting restaurant and I believe that they cater to a certain demographic which is their niche but for my taste and expectations, I believe I fall out of that niche. Not to take anything away from them but for me it's so so. Hope your experience is better than mine."}
{"text":"Solid pizza place in the NW Valley.  Some of the best pizza crust I've ever had.  It's a little loud but the service has been very good everytime I've gone and it's a great place to go before a movie.  Food is top-notch."}
{"text":"This place has quickly ascended to my favorite place on Mill Ave. The service at the bar is outstanding and so friendly. They have a ton of great craft and specialty beers. The food is awesome too! Get the meatballs! They also have great happy hour specials and awesome daily specials as well. Management has done a great job over the last few months of turning Mellow into a must visit during a night out on Mill."}
{"text":"This pizza spot was stumbled upon as my husband and I walked our first night Uptown Charlotte.  It was very close to the park where we watched fire works and children playing in the multi colored water falls! 

As soon as we walked in we were seated with a view of the street. 

The menu was awesome. We ordered the Meatball Trio. They were huge and smothered in a fabulous sauce. The meat was seasoned to perfection and there was just enough cheese for a cheese fanatic like me.

We also ordered a small House Special pizza! It was freaking amazing! Pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, bacon, mushrooms, olives, green peppers, roma tomatoes and onion! Incredible! Best pizza I ever had in my life! 

I will be going back as much as possible."}
{"text":"This review is a tough one to write.  I like the Mellow Mushroom overall but there are just some flawed pieces that I can't avoid.  The food is good, not great.  I have had a variety of food here from sandwiches to the veggie pizza.  I like everything I have eaten fairly well.  It comes in a reasonable time. 

Then there is the bad.  The food is good but for what you pay it should be more than good.  This isn't filet mignon we are talking about.  This is salads, sandwiches, and specialty pizza.  Most of this stuff I can make at home and when I go to a restaurant if I am going to eat something that I can make at home, it better be pretty darn skippy.  If I wanted to get a really good sandwich at a good price I would go across the street and get something from Jersey Mike's.   For this price it needs to be great.  So I just can't justify going here anymore."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place! My boyfriend and I were brought here by a groupon promotion and the server named Brandon was so nice and helpful when ordering! We ordered a Caesar salad and a funky q chicken/ loaded potato pizza which were both among the best I've ever had! The pizza and service was AMAZING to say the least and we'll be definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Yes: the pizza takes some time, but the serve told us it would.  Pizzas are cooked fresh & to order: I would rather wait for fresh than have a cardboard, coagulated piece of crap that spent an hour under a heat lamp.
Our sever was on the ball, funny, friendly & a sweet girl.
My only complaint: LOUD!  I wish the \"all metal, steel & exposed hardware\" trend would pass.  I don't need candles, white table clothes & thick drapes at a pizza place, but a little something to absorb the noise would be nice.  Being there on a Friday evening was really trying- I'm not a fan of having to shout to the persons next to and across from me.  
Back to the positive: the mushroom soup was fantastic!!  Also: LOADS of vegetarian and vegan selections!!"}
{"text":"A pizza restaurant that servers the best breakfast in the valley.  Yes it does, you should all try it."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza place. Fun drinks and great happy hour. Can get pretty busy for dinner so plan to wait if you come around that time."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant.  The place is set up really nice. Sat at a high top so I could watch some football. Server was really nice and prompt, her name is Ashley. I ordered the burger and my friend ordered a pizza. The burger was really good, loved the fresh pickle slices and it was cooked perfect. I had a slice of the pizza, and I was not impressed,  it just didn't hit my taste buds right. But, it's a personal opinion. I would hit this joint up again."}
{"text":"I must've hit my head and had amnesia for a while as I clearly forgot how amazing Mellow Mushroom was. Why haven't I been here more often since it's just down the street from me? Not a clue -- amnesia is the only logical explanation. 

Met a friend here for happy hour the other night. I wasn't too hungry but grabbed a blueberry light brew something -- with the help of our amazing server's recommendation (quite delish!), and we ended up sharing an everything pizza, no olives (sorry, I didn't order it so I don't even know what Mellow Mushroom calls it). 

The pizza came out pretty quick and the moment it was set down on the table, my mouth started watering. This fresh-out-of-the-oven pizza looked absolutely picture perfect, like no joke (should've Instagrammed it, lol... I mean, if you eat a meal without posting it on Instagram, did you really even eat it?). 

I was thoroughly impressed with this picturesque pizza -- but did it taste as good as it looked?! Yes, yes it did. The crust was perfectly baked and a tad crispy but still had that 'sink-your-teeth-in' softness to it; perfect combo! There were also the perfect amount of toppings on it as well, not too overloaded to make the crust soggy or collapse in your hand, but not sparingly either... it was just right. Wowza! It was love at first bite; the flavors created a pizza party in my mouth! So yummy! My tastebuds and tummy were happy at the end of the night... and I had a slice leftover for lunch the next day. Score! 

***Note to self: I need to go to Mellow Mushroom more often.***"}
{"text":"I love Mellow Mushroom's happy hour and usually make it in for reverse happy hour a few times a month. The beer list is awesome, similar to yard house and they feature local brews. You cant beat cheap drinks ($3 southern comfort on happy hour) and half off on appetizers. I recommend the gourmet white pizza (the crust is amazing) and the tortilla soup. 
I wish I could give the place 4 stars but the bar area is decently busy at night and if you sit at a booth the bartenders want you to come up to the bar to order rather than come to you. They also use hidden valley ranch instead of making their own."}
{"text":"The food was very good but the service was terrible.  It took awhile for the waiter to come to our party of 4 to take our order and then after getting our food from a different waitress we never had another waiter or waitress come check on us , drinks ran dry which is not ideal eating a large salty, cheesy, crusty pizza. After finishing the pizza we sat and waited a VERY long time for our waiter to at least bring our check. He was very nearby taking care of other tables but never even glanced in our direction.  Finally, I had to get up and go find him to ask for our check . Again, we waited awhile before he even came back with that.  We would have been better off at a self service fired pie pizza place where we could at least get up and refill drinks , get more napkins, etc. ourselves."}
{"text":"Not bad for a chain restaurant. Had the Holy Shiitake pie- so good.  The truffle oil and caramelized onions worked so well together and each bite was better than the last. I requested the thinner crust which I think really fit well w the ingredients - a thick crust would have been too filing."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom has a perfectly casual, college-centered atmosphere. It's on Mill Avenue so it can get very busy with intoxicated college students. It's not a place for those who prefer quiet \"fine\" dining, that's for sure, but it's open late and is perfect for a midnight pizza binge (my specialty!).

But as for the food, it's pretty damn good. I especially enjoyed their Maui Wowie pizza- it certainly did the job in \"wowing\" me and my boyfriend! I'm usually not a Hawaii-style pizza fan but this pizza was superb. The Philosopher's Pie is also a safe choice, but is not nearly as good. Their appetizers didn't impress me as much; it was pretty standard food for a pizza place.

Despite their mostly standard, typical taste as far as food as concerned, this is definitely the restaurant to come to for a friendly, laid-back experience that'll satisfy any pizza craving. The menu has plenty of gems; just ask a few of the regulars. The staff is cool, the place is cool, and the pizza is piping hot. Mmm.

Seriously. Just take a bite of the Maui Wowie and you'll become as obsessed as I am."}
{"text":"It was all good till the very end.  Try the spinach dip - awesome!   Our server was great too.  The combo large pizza was pretty good too.  We had some left over pizza so we boxed it up and hung out at our table right in front of the where they tossed the pizza.  Pretty cool!  All was well till the very last moment.  We got up to leave and hadn't even made it to the door and \"oops\" forgot the pizza!  Literally turned around and the table busser had thrown our pizza in the trash!  We weren't 10 feet away, not even out the door!  Seriously!  Wow.  What really upsets us is that the busser was real quick to respond - \"you left the table\".  I was like what? You couldn't even make the slightest extra effort to say \"hey don't forget your pizza\".  It was boxed!  We didn't intend to leave it behind.  Nope, instantly in the trash.  A entire half a pizza.  Not exactly cheap pizza either. So bottom line is - won't be back.  Over such a small but infuriating circumstance. \"The difference between good and great is that tiny little extra effort.\""}
{"text":"Love it! 1/2 priced drinks and 1/2 priced appetizers during happy hour! It can't get better than that. All of the food here is incredible I've never been disappointed. They have a huge beer selection with some local beers, during hh you can get an amazing craft beer for around 3-4 dollars. Unheard of! My friends and I stop by once or twice a week during happy hour and invite our friends from out of town to join us here for drinks."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Lots of unique choices, as well as a Make Your Own option. We ordered take out, one was a chicken pizza and one was a BBQ pizza, I can't remember exactly what they're called. I would definitely come again to try out some other pizzas."}
{"text":"Met up with friends and did the 6-course beer and food pairing (all for only around $30) last night. I even won the raffle! And yes, I think the maroon Moose Drool golf towel was the appropriate choice in gift - especially when put next to the beer glass with paper placemat and camouflage cap. But anyway, we had a gregarious, rollicking Epicurean evening of beer samplings and not-too-shabby food courses. Loved the bleu cheese crumbles w/  vinagrette salad and the sausage meatball...thing. I like the coffee porter, and the banana-y tasting lager. Ladies, thanks for the extras! Service was top notch - 5 stars for that alone. What a night...I will be back for sure - hopefully with my posse!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for lunch. I'm on Mill Ave often, and I've seen it since it was being built, so I thought I'de try it. The decor was interesting - kind of trendy. I ate at a high table in the bar area, and it was adult contemprary rock chic. The staff was pleasant and the service was reasonable.
  I had the Mushroom Club and I enjoyed it. The addition of the mushroom flavor to the club sndwich was welcome. The amount of meat to bread was good, making a decent sandwich. Expect to pay $7-10 for lunch. Truthfully, three stars is on the low side, but I'm not sure I would rate it at four - more like a three and a half. I'd go again, but I'm not sure that I'll coming here for it specifcally. The biggest challenge is that it's a pretty good place surrounded by some really great places.
   I would expect it to be a much better place late nights - it seems like that kind of place. I would actually like to see this place with some live music late nights."}
{"text":"Tried MM on a Monday afternoon with the missus. We arrived at 3:30 and there were 20 guests inside and three servers. Good ratio. 

My wife ordered wine and a GF pizza with two ingredients. I got an iced tea and a small mighty meat pizza. Check came to $42.36 plus tip. A lot for two 10\" pies, wine and tea. 

It arrived in 14 mins, piping hot as usual. Our server, JoAnna, was a bit slow with the service but when we asked for anything, she delivered. Rather undecided about her. 

The GF pizza was disappointing. We've had a lot of GF pizzas, so we know good from bad. There was almost no sauce on it. In fact, my wife said she didn't want the leftovers until I told her I could make some marinara at home. My pie was very good tho. It had plenty of toppings, sauce and cheese."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, and there are plenty of different items on the menu... Great for kids and an amazing atmosphere. We had the pizza delivered to us (this time; we have been here a few times). However we waited for 80 minutes to get our food delivered to us so the delivery service was poor.   Overall the salad was excellent and the pizza is a good portion size... Something kids and adults will both really enjoy."}

{"text":"Our school planned our end of the year luncheon at Mellow Mushroom and it could not have been easier or more wonderful!  They took our small teacher budget and gave us a large amount of high quality, delicious food.  They also heard about some food allergies that we were not aware of and accommodated us without even thinking twice.  The catering manager, Danielle, was so easy and fabulous to work with and the manager and staff made the experience exceptional!  Thank you so much!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I really don't like this location. The host and hostess seem soo unorganized. Nothing pleasant about their customer service. Thru out our time there. Our waiter seem to be annoyed and don't see him often. So I keep it short and sweet. In and out.. I definitely enjoyed the Sewlyn location much better so as soon as we left. I mentioned to ppl I went with.. I'm not coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Gluten-Free pizza crust - amazing, chewy, flavorful, finally! This is the main reason I want to go back and give MM at Happy Valley a second chance.

Small flies shared my table. This is the main reason I'm hesitant to give it a second chance  :(

Friday seems to be the big day for deliveries, at least in this location.....and deliveries lend to distracted managers at the lunch hour, which is not good. 
The food I ordered took forever to get to the table, and the server seemed to forget which tables were hers and if she had already taken some orders or not?!
The entree salad was tasty, but didn't have near enough turkey on it for an entree. 
Pizza with white sauce = yum, especially offset by the sun dried tomatoes.

I know...this review is a bit disjointed....kinda like my visit that day!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are amazing, but what really caught the attention of my boyfriend and I, was our server, Robert. 

My boyfriend and I are in the restaurant business, so it was weird for us to have a Friday evening off. We decided to stop by mellow mushroom for a late dinner, and had Robert as our server. 

He was awesome. We had ordered some wings as an app, and a pepperoni pizza. I also enjoyed a couple of glasses of angry orchard (coupled with a shot of Fireball), and everything was delicious. Robert was very attentive and extremely friendly. Every time he left our table, my boyfriend and I would talk about how helpful and sweet he was. Y'all better hold on to this dude. He was awesome. We ended our night with a warm brownie with chocolate frosting. Yummy! 

Thank you, Robert, for making our rare Friday night off an enjoyable experience. You were perfect, and will be back way more often."}
{"text":"Mellow mushroom has the best staff! AMBER, Kara, Chris, Lissette and Marlena always take excellent care of us at the bar. They're always attentive to our needs and we leave happy every time. The pizza is always amazing no matter what kind you order and the pretzels are a great appetizer if you are just hanging out for a beer with a few friends! This is always my go-to spot any night of the week! Keep up the great service and food, we love it here!"}
{"text":"Me and the husband came here on a Thursday night around 7pm. The place wasn't busy at all but the surrounding shopping area isn't popping off, stopped here because we were at the FedEx shipping place. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken and Red Skin Potato Pie pizzas. Both pizzas were very delicious but the potato could of had more potato but had lots of cheese, my husband stole the slice I let him taste. The pizza crust was soft, crispy, and puffy with seasoned garlic parm. I also order the Hendricks Refresher cocktail and it's was very tasty with gin/cucumber/basil but wish it wasn't $10 because I wanted another. Yum Yum."}
{"text":"I love MM, and the service here is great. The only thing that I kind of was annoyed at was the fact that I paid $1.29 for mushrooms, and I got only got about 6 pieces. I should have definitely got more than 6 if I'm paying that much per topping!"}
{"text":"By far the best service ever! Bobby is the coolest bartender ever. He knows how to start a conversation and also his drinks are amazing! The manager Marko who was with him super professional and extremely nice! I will definitely be going back to this location!! :)"}
{"text":"It's something about the crust. I'm addicted.  Plus the service was great and the food came out rather quickly for a Saturday night.  I even ordered dessert and told the waitress that I knew the meaning behind the menu titles.  She smiled and winked at me."}
{"text":"I would attach a picture of the food that we ordered... except we never got it.

We waited for an hour!!!!  We went in at 9 pm for a pizza.... ordered about 5 minutes in and then.... nothing.  We waited... an waited... and waited.  The waiter came over 30 minutes later and asked if there was anything he could get us.  \"Sure, our food,\" was my reply.  He told us a few minutes.  He didn't offer an explanation or an apology which would have made a world of difference.  Another 30 minutes later (don't ask WHY we waited that long) we still had nothing.  Our waiter told us it would be another 2 minutes.  Five minutes later I explained that we were done waiting and were going to leave.  I told him that pizza takes about 15-20 minutes.  He said their pizza was better and required more prep time.... that is bull.  If it required THAT much time there would be a disclaimer on the menu saying so.

Ended up going to In N Out..... will definitely NOT be returning to Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Came here with the rents and hubbers.  The place was dead- I don't really know why?  My dad and husband enjoyed the beer selection and our waitress was knowledgeable and helpful with the selections.  The pizza was also very good.  We'll be back :)"}
{"text":"We were treated so poorly!  The DD was not allowed to have her coffee with her, one of the IDs was apparently not sufficient, and the drink I wanted was not able to be made because that location does not carry the ingredients for it.  Why have a chain drink menu if not all locations can make the drinks on the menu?!  I understand the reasoning behind all of the things that went wrong, but the one star is due to the waitress being SO snotty and condescending."}
{"text":"This was our first time here in Arizona.  My husband and I along with our two kids brought my mom to visit my little brother here in Phoenix.  After a long and tired drive from Cali., we were starving.  The restaurant's name, Mellow Mushrooms really caught our attentions so we decided to check it out.  The wait for a table was not too long. We waited maybe 15 minutes.  Our server was friendly and the pizzas were delicious. We ordered two large pizzas. We were worried that ordering just one pizza for a party of 6 would be nice too small but we thought wrong.  The pizzas were decent sizes and we actually had left overs.  To top it all off a mysterious person paid our tab.  When our server told us, I was so shocked.  I almost cried but managed to hold back tears. My family and I had confused looks.  This was the best thing that happened to me this year.  What a great way to end the year.  There's good people out there.  May god bless our secret santa. We will definitely pay it forward."}
{"text":"Like usual, I came in late and there were very few stores open.  I thought I give mellow a shot.   Ordered the meatballs and the stuffed portobellos.   Uggg when they say mellow they weren't kidding.  It's equivalent to no flavor.  I took a bite of the meatballs and said no thank you, not wasting my calories on this.   The stuffed portobello also was lackluster in the flavor department."}
{"text":"****updating review****
The owner contacted me to discuss and asked me to come back for a 2nd try. I have not had the chance to do so, but the owner reaching out and reading reviews says a lot.  I'll try to again and see how it goes :)


 I get that this is a laid back kind of place but that shouldn't mean little to no attention.

The food was decent. Although it does take a while to come out. We were all pretty pleased with it.

Our waitress however was pretty lax. She took our drink order. Forgot the lemons someone asked for and didn't offer sweetener. I know I ordered unsweetened tea but that's because I want to control the sweetness content myself.  We pretty much didn't see her again. Our drinks remained unfilled until another waiter asked if we would like refills (she did refill the water, but we had tea and sodas at the table). 

The pizza came out, brought out by someone else. And we had no plates. So she brought us plates. The two people who helped our table were more present and friendlier than the waitress we had. 

Before we were even done eating she was quick to ask about dessert and bring us our check though. Which I find offensive as you're trying to push us out. Sorry the tip wasn't very good but you didn't really do much. 

Laid back shouldn't mean bad service. Had she acknowledged her absence or forgetting lemons or anything... we would have been more forgiving. But nothing. We probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Mellow Mushroom on Mill Ave.    We went in for dinner and were unfortunately wildly unimpressed.   First off,  beers are pretty expensive.    We ordered two entrees for dinner.  Wife's food (avocado sandwich) was adequate.   Hopefully that was not their satisfaction goal.   I ordered a burger., and it was very disappointing.   It was clear the food sat and sat and sat and sat waiting for someone to bring it to us after it was cooked.   The Burger was merely edible.  Again, i hope that was not the bar they were looking to achieve.    The roasted potatoes were literally probably the worst food item i have ever received at a restaurant ever.   Way overcooked!!    The cook/chef that sent those abominations out from the kitchen needs to hang up his chef hat and go back to whatever career path he was really meant  to follow.   Cooking is just not for him/her.    It stinks when you leave dinner thinking- that was overall pretty terrible.   Luckily, the beer was at least cold and delicious."}
{"text":"Maybe it is a smidge pricey but the pizzas are really good love the crust and sauce. We got pretzel bites very good.  Really good service and the interior of the Mesa location is very very cool,"}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent but the service is horrible.  Every other time I go there it's a problem.  Today was the final straw.  The hostess sat us at a dirty table and just walked away with only some of the trash on the table and left us sitting there with a wet table and wet menus the previous diners."}
{"text":"So this is my second time eating @mellowmushroom. The first time I tried it out in South Carolina.
   
I gave it a try again in Rocky River since it was new to the area like myself... Walked in and stood around and waited until this nice girl named Ashton did a great job.

  We ordered the \"tortilla soup with avocado\" and I must say it was five stars. That good!! 
The \"Maui Wowie\" was really flavorful because we asked for the red sauce along with the pesto that topped the piZza off... Really good!!
  
The \"Mighty Meaty\" was okay... The ground beef was flavorless and if they perhaps seasoned the meat or substitute it with spicy sausage it may have made a huge difference in capturing the flavor profile. 
  
All and all I hope this business succeeds here. The beer selection is always a plus!!"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is slow and not that great. I've gone here on several occasions and am always let down in the service department. My co-workers and I have gone here for several happy hours. We usually order a Funky Q which is usually gone quickly."}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of pizza. But if I am then this will be the place to go when I want pizza. I alway eat a slice of whatever my friends and family order when we come here and I never can complain. Their pizza is hot, have a nice favor to it and not greasy. 
However, one of my all time favorite thing on their menu is the bruschetta. I dream and crave for it all the time. Their freshly diced, not watery tomatoes, basil and seasoning tossed in a balsamic vinegar. Topped with feta cheese and fresh basil on a nicely, heavenly garlic toast and don't forget the icing which is drizzled balsamic glaze. Whatever they're doing. The tomatoes alway taste like it's in season. And the balsamic glaze make it a little sweet. Omg, writing about it make my mouth water and I just had it today. If I can buy their recipe, I totally would. Love it. 
They let you know off the back, their pizza takes time because its made to order. You literally get hit in the face with that sign. They salad is huge. I order their \"lil\" Caesar salad. Which is good but it's big enough for 2 1/2 ppl to share.   
From what I heard, Mellow Mushrooms went away for awhile. Well, I'm glad it's back and hope they will stay. Nice place for kids and of course the hipsters. Will definitely be back for more bruschetta."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, way overpriced and super busy.  We went on a Friday night around 8pm and fully expected it to be busy, but Jesus... It was SO LOUD we couldn't hear each other over the table without yelling.  It was like a Chuck e Cheese with all the kids running around (mostly from 2 tables) being completely ignored like it was the norm. Our waiter while really nice was so busy he couldn't think straight. We ordered an appetizer he forgot about until after the food arrived. He apologized but defeated the purpose of ordering one.  We were completely done eating before I got my drink.  Again he apologized and didn't charge me for it, but it would have been nice to drink something other than water with our meal. Maybe it was an off night, maybe he was just overwhelmed, who knows.  But when my wife commented about the noise after the kids left he said \"if you think that's bad, never come here on a sat or Sunday afternoon! All the soccer moms come in after practice and then it's really ridiculous \" bottom like maybe a midweek lunch stop? Probably won't be back for dinner.  Heard the drink specials are great if you don't mind the chaos though"}
{"text":"I've loved this place for years! I am so glad they opened one up right next to my house! The pretzels with beer cheese is a must-order for an appetizer, but the beer cheese pairs excellently with your pizza crust as well! My personal favorite is the loaded potato, but I've had nearly all of their pizzas and have never not liked one!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, the food and salads were great both times. Although at both trips the restaurant had probably less than 6 tables occupied, not large groups , 2-4 at each table. Pre lunch hours. Yesterday it was 45-50 minutes for a salad and two small pizzas. A lot of staff was present and it looked like a lot of kitchen crew was there.
I wouldn't plan on a quick lunch if you're in a hurry"}
{"text":"Great pizza... Super friendly staff and very family friendly. Wish it wasn't so noisy inside when it gets busy. But that doesn't stop us from coming back or having it delivered."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom just ekes out the 4 stars, but mostly because there is inconsistency across the grading platforms. The location is great, the bar with indoor and outdoor seating is great, the happy hour is great and the tzatziki sauce was literally one of the best I've ever had. 
The pizza however was just okay. I couldn't taste the red sauce at all, there was a disparity in the toppings placement, and the ever important crust that you hold was great, the crust under the toppings just ok and was too floppy for my taste.  
The service a little slow, very friendly, but if you are a sweet Melissa's regular, it's very similar. 
I do recommend it, because it's a place with a nice atmosphere and families and dates alike will feel equally at home and will probably come back for happy hour and try something other than pizza."}
{"text":"I have been to the 'Shroom a couple times now since going gluten free. There isn't much in the form of non-gluten items at the 'Shroom, but they do have gluten free pizza.

Which... last time I was there... I was glutened by.  It wasn't huge or anything, but it felt like a cross contamination issue, so if you go and are very sensitive like I am, make sure they cook it safely for you.

FYI... the capris sauce, is not GF.  I was so bummed.

Service has never been an issue here... they are always friendly.

What I also like is that they have ciders included in their massive beer list! Yay... 

When I went to the 'Shroom before being diagnosed Celiac, I used to have their hoagies... OMG. I loved the portobello veggie one... it was amazing.

The ambiance of the place is cool... very trendy like with artsy photos of downtown Phoenix and wacky things... like videos of eyes looking at you in the bar.  So weird. lol"}
{"text":"Seriously awesome soup!! Totally dissatisfied with the service - I sat at the bar with one other person and 2 high tops.  My server has a small throw down tantrum with the floor manager about being to busy.  My food was brought to me and I was never checked on again.  No water and no second beer.  Never again too many other food options in the same area.  If you hate that bartender Job that much go find something else.  You ruined my meal with your tantrum."}
{"text":"Your job as a server, has its ups and downs. I totally understand. That does NOT give you the right to be rude with your customers. 

Don't EVER, go to your table and tell them,     \"If you guys want, I'll be more than happy to get you another server\". First off, we never asked for another server. All we said was, please don't walk away so fast, when we are trying to order more food/drinks, or need the most basic thing- silverware. And you got upset or butt hurt that we had any feed back to your horrible service. Because it was that-  Horrible! Don't put your finger up to tell us \"one minute\" and not even make eye contact with your customers. We are paying to eat here, you are getting PAID. See the difference? Also, take into account that it's how you say something and not what you say. You could have said \"I'll be right with you guys, bare with me\". At least give acknowledgement that you know we are here and need/want something. 

It's busy, you're running around, all understandable. We've been there, but you apologize and move on. DO NOT give us attitude because you hate your job. If you can't deal with customers, I suggest you get into a different career. Service is simply not for you!
 
Server we had: Tall, red head. Tatted with 1991 on his arm. Never got his name. I guess introducing yourself to customers was not taught. Unfortunate."}
{"text":"Met friends here for dinner tonight for my first visit. Overall it was fairly enjoyable. The pizza was tasty, the cheesy bread was yum and the drinks were kept full. We had the Gourmet White and the Funky Q Chicken. Both were tasty but not better than anything else I've had. Our server was ok. He wasn't friendly, but he wasn't distant either. He was just kind of there. The restaurant is pretty open and bright which is nice. 

All that having been said...Mellow Mushroom is PRICEY. We had 2 pizzas, cheesy bread and fountain drinks and the bill came to $70. I don't get sticker shock often, but that one surprised me and honestly, it wasn't worth $70. I've had better pizza at Picasso's without the sticker shock. 

Mellow Mushroom was ok. I'd go back but I'd say begrudgingly at best. It's a long way to drive for me to spend $70 on pizza."}
{"text":"Great service. Love the umami pizza. It's local so you can't find that one anywhere else. The crust is also amazing."}
{"text":"The gluten free crust is absolutely vomitous. They need to find another recipe besides one for cardboard. There are so many gluten free crusts out there that are fabulous. Super disappointed. We  ordered a build your own pizza and forgot to mention which sauce we wanted so instead of asking us they brought it automatically with marinara which paired horribly with the other ingredients on the pizza. I want to give it one star but I'm giving it 2 stars because the mushroom soup was actually very good."}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona and it was the first time trying this place - it was great. Our Uber driver recommended us and I can see why. We received great service from the time we walked in to the time we walked out. Our Server's name was Brendan i believe; he did an incredible job... and the pizza's are delicious! I would definitely come back and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Came in to the Mellow Mushroom in Tempe on Mills Ave. on Pi day because they had a sign out from that said ,\" come celebrate pi day with pizza 3.14.\" When we asked about the special we were told there were none. When we pointed out the sign in front of the store advertising the special, the host dismissively said it was just an inside joke. I mentioned that it shouldn't be advertised as such. The manager then came over and said that there was no special but maybe their sign was worded wrong. But he would possibly give us a small discount. We cancelled our order and left."}
{"text":"My husband & I come here about once a week for a few years now and are never let down. Our favorite \"go to\" place! The happy hour is unbeatable. People know this, so you have to get there early to get a seat! Half off beers & appetizers..killer deal! The wings are the very best and we are addicted to them! A 20 oz Grapefruit Sculpin for $3.50?? Unheard of! Love, love, love this place. The service is also exceptional and very friendly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and employees are truly the best in the area and the food is some of the best pizza in Arizona. Gotta check this place out!!! Oh and Happy Hour is such a great deal half off appetizers and drink specials galore!"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried MM for the first time and we both loved it. Thai dye was what we ordered and it turned out to be really good. Location and atmosphere is great. The server was nice. The restroom doors have a little metal attachment fixed near the bottom so that you can open the door without having to touch anything with your hand! Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at Mellow Mushroom.  Hosted a baby shower there ave it was simply awesome.  Tara was the best!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good.. But everything else I have gotten is not so great!  A turkey sandwich with 2 thin slices of meat... Not nice!  Norterra location is good.  But this one has some work to do!  But plenty of draft beer just to hang at the bar!

Service is slow... 30 min for food at lunch is not cool!!

Nice job on the build out.  Nicest one yet!  I will keep going and see if it gets better..."}
{"text":"This place is great! So many beers on tap its crazy! We ordered a cheese, sausage and sauteed onion pizza. It was possible the best pizza I have ever had. Outstanding!!!!!!!


Will be back soon...."}
{"text":"I used the Groupon for my first visit and the food was amazing. Service was a little slow, but her good attitude and politeness made up for the slowness. That and the food was amazing. We ordered the \"magical\" something pizza which has pesto sauce, spinach, mushrooms, and jalepenos on it. Amazing. Went back later in the weekend for their late night slices which were a good drunken munchie alternative to Jimmy johns, slices, or chronic taco. 

Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Our family loves to meet at this Mellow Mushroom. The pizza is well worth the wait. The funky Q (BBQ) and the buffalo chicken pizza are our favorites. It's always a hard choice for which beer as they carry so many great brewery's."}
{"text":"I love the one on Mill Ave. but I took my son to this one on his birthday. I checked in \"Birthday lunch!!\" right when I got there which is how I know that we left after 12 minutes because a server never came over to take our order. We even waited a bit longer after someone (a manager?) said they'd find our server for us. Nothing."}
{"text":"Killer beer selection. Great personal service. Will come back. Ask for Jenny she knows her beer. Try the fun guys pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to the Mellow Mushroom twice.  The first time we walked out due to not receiving any service after being seated for 15 minutes.  So, last night we decided to give them a second chance.  It appeared that the Mushroom must be a popular place, as it was pretty crowded for a Thursday evening and it was just about an hour after happy hour.  So, our expectations began to rise a bit.  We had the garlic and cheese pretzels first.  I have seen some reviews that raved about the pretzels, but ours were bland, couldn't even taste any garlic...and they were tough, which I thought was kind of strange for a pretzel.  We both ordered the Chicken and Cheese hoagie, which wasn't bad, but wasn't great either, very mediocre.  I do have to give our waitress credit for being attentive even though she was busy.  So, I would give the service a step above average.  The reason for that was that the bus boy came by to clear dishes that were no longer being used with a tub.  Seriously???  I have never seen wait staff walk around clearing a table that was still seated with a dish tub that would normally stay in the kitchen area.  Just left a bad taste in my experience here.  I don't think we will be returning.  Oh yeah, 6-7 dollars for a bottle of beer?  Yes, there is quite a selection, but sorry, I wont pay that for 12 oz bottle of beer, unless it is something a bit more upscale."}
{"text":"This is a great Mellow Mushroom location, although your pizza order can be hit or miss depending on when you visit. We ordered a pizza with light cheese one night, and it was perfect. The next time we ordered a pizza with light cheese, it was as if they thought we meant extra cheese. Still though, the pizza at MM is definitely delicious, with the best dough we have ever tasted. From the pizza to the appetizer pretzels, you won't be disappointed with the dough. It is so good. They now serve burgers, but at a pizza place, I'm not sure why they need to. 

This location has great decorations, with a huge mushroom in the center of the restaurant. They seem to have an Aladdin theme going on, but an Alice in Wonderland theme would be more fitting with the giant mushroom. 

This location has a bunch of televisions for your favorite sports watching, and it's a large restaurant with an upstairs balcony style section. 

The wait staff are friendly, and parking is readily available in the private parking lot or garage of the center."}
{"text":"Pizza was great.  Not too loud, not too quiet. Service was great.  Bummed we didn't try this before.  We will be coming back"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in ASU! The service is great and the pizza is very flavorful. Me being from NYC, I'm very very picky on the kind of pizza I eat. I had the 14 inch Buffalo Chicken Pizza and it was so delicious! If you're on Mill Ave and you're craving pizza, come here!"}
{"text":"The food here is good and this location seems to be improving with each moving van, dropping off new residents to the former bankrupt Desert Ridge North area. While real estate sales have gone from non-existent at this north Phoenix area, to white hot over the past twelve months. Go figure 

We love everything on the menu, including the appetizers like the soft pretzels, the meatballs (I'll return to this in a minute), their pizza selections are tasty and they also have an extensive beer list.  To top it off, their Happy Hour has most drinks marked 50% off!  So all good, right?  Well maybe. 

As we said, we like the Mellow Mushroom. But on our most recent visit, it was m'eh at best. The big negative for us was the afore mentioned meatballs. 

Sadly, they weren't even half cooked. The plate was ice cold, the marinara sauce was cold, meatballs(photo) were luke warm but pre-cooked, and the mozzarella inside was not melted and also cold. Ugh. 

I've decided to average out my rating to Three Stars, because we like the place and they normally do a nice job. 

So yes, we'll be back. But, they need to get their act together."}
{"text":"Great food and so many vegetarian options!!! My husband had the twice cooked wings and a small pizza they were both fantastic!! I had the brucetta and a small cheese pizza, again absolutely fantastic!! The pizza is crispy on the bottom and just perfect everywhere else!! Also many great beers on tap and in the bottle that you can't get other places!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place out about a year ago and have not been back since.  My husband loves pizza, he can eat a whole one to himself!  We started off with a salad and a lemonade as I was pregnant at the time.  The lemonade tasted like city water.... I would suggest a filter on their water system? The salad was alright, sounded better on the menu.  We ordered a pretty plain pizza, pepperoni and cheese.  After one slice neither my husband or I wanted to eat anymore.  The dough was in our opinion very undercooked.  Although we were warned that their dough is like this because after all it is the special way they make their pizza, but we did not like it.  What we did like was the location, ambience and our server was very sweet."}
{"text":"I am a sucker for promotions, and the last time we ate at MM they gave us a card good for a \"special\" prize that could only be revealed by our server on our next visit. I think this kind of thing is genius! I carried the magic card in my wallet imagining what my prize would be. Turns out it was a free calzone. Bonus!

We happily order the meatball app, which comes out looking delicious and doesnt disappoint one bit. Three skewers with giant meatballs attached with a slab of mozzarella floating on a hot pond of marinara and sprinkled with parmesan and what seemed like bits of crouton (?). I love me some meatballs and these were definitely not balls to pass up!  

For din, I asked to turn my \"free cheese calzone\" into a chicken one and pay the difference, but our waitress informed me that was not at all possible. I pretty-please asked her if she would just check with the manager on duty for me to see if it could be done. She agreed and of course she came back and said \"yeah we can do it\". Ok, great. JD ordered a plain pepperoni personal and he was happy with it. Good crust, lots of pep and gooey cheese. My chicken calazone came out looking like two giant cornacopia's of dough, cheese onions, peppers and chicken. It was massive and they had split it in half and just a half was a hulk of a serving. It came with hot marinara sauce on the side for dipping or just pouring over. We were all over that baby and the waitress even commented when we were finished that we did \"better than most people\" who order their calzones. Was she saying we were cows? Maybe, but I was too full and happy to care. 

All in all, it wasn't amazing and I still prefer other places calzones (Spinato's, NYPD Pizza) but if are a calzone lover I'd say give MM a go-round. 

*****I didnt see one waitperson's panties this time, major bonus!"}
{"text":"The service will be its downfall.  Loved the atmosphere, the bar and the beer selection.  Food is good.  Pretzels are just ok and not for a party of 2 - they are huge.  Salad did not have the ingredients that it was supposed to have.  Pizza was great.  Service was terrible.  Took forever to be seated (hostess chatted on the phone for 10 minutes while we stood there), to be acknowledged by our server (15 minutes), to place our order (20 minutes, with our menus closed), to get our food (40 minutes) (and the appetizer came out with the pizza), and to get our check and to pay (30 minutes of sitting there, waiting).    Restaurant was mostly empty and there was plenty of staff.  The food is not a big enough draw to tolerate the bad service.  And, even though they offer lunch specials, you will never get out in an hour."}
{"text":"The bartender made me and a friend of mine mocktails since we are both pregnant while the rest of our group drank. They were delicious pomegranate lemonade type drinks and we were definitely surprised with the fun concoction. This fun place is in a perfect spot in downtown Charlotte across from the new ballpark. It was perfect for a pregaming spot."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best Pizza ever, BUT they have a delivery problem. 3 times - 4 minutes away - & they get lost every time. Result: cold pizza. They can remember the phone number & address, but can't record  a 3 step direction?"}
{"text":"I've been to mellow mushroom on High Street a few times.  Solid pizza, average service, a little overpriced.  I love, love, love pizza and have to say there isn't anything super special about Mellow Mushroom, but it definitely satisfies the need for a good pizza with fresh ingredients and great flavor.  

The only reason I don't come here regularly is the service.  I've sat at the bar and the dining room with my family.  The staff seems more interested in each other and their social happenings than working, and have had several slow encounters.  I wouldn't mind paying the premium they charge for pizza if they could hit that x-factor for service."}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday lunch.  Both the hummus appetizer and pizza were excellent.  I have been a fan of Mellow Mushroom since I went to the one in Hilton Head many years ago.  Great pizza!  Service was also great."}
{"text":"Decent craft beer menu, love the mystery beer!  Really good lunch special.  +Gluten-free options.  Decent servers who appear pretty mellow just like the name implies.  Fun senses of humor abound (if you like dry humor).  The menu isn't spectacular so I burn out on this place quickly, although I do enjoy it each time I go."}
{"text":"For being a pizza joint...they don't have good pizza. Cardboard like crust and super dry meats especially the chicken. I keep going back thinking it was an off day but I continue to be disappointed so I'm done with their pizza. 48 beers on tap...that may keep me going but that's it."}
{"text":"Real time notes.

Distracted, dopey sever. Couldn't hear a damn word from her due to loud restaurant and low talker 

$22 for a medium pizza and they have paper napkins?!??!? I priced out a \"build your own\" salad and it would have been $40!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times. I wanted to update that they have a new vegan cheese that was amazing. It made my pizza amazing. As usual they have great service"}
{"text":"Overpriced mediocre pizza. Our family of four (2 kids 2 adults) dined here for lunch and dropped $82 (including tip) for pizza that was just OK and a good beer selection. 
The pizza is too bready and not very crisp. There are better pizza choices in the area."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I really wanted to like this place because the beer selection had me giddy and the food was definitely decent, albeit kind of expensive for the ASU neighborhood. The pizza was better than the rest of what I sampled from the menu but unfortunately, the service was horrendous. 
We went towards the end of a celebration involving beer that the town was having and it was Saturday night so we expected it to be on the busier side. The bar area was loud thanks to an excessively high music volume (I promise I'm not just old and grumpy) and people getting their buzz on. It was a little disorienting and it didn't allow my friends and I to carry on a conversation, but it's not a big deal. It's a college bar/restaurant, after all. The servers, as well as the bartender (who seemed to be serving and talking with the same few people, getting them one drink after another, while neglecting everyone else), were clearly inattentive and probably overworked. It looked to me like everyone had too much on their plates and none of them seemed to be on top of things. They were too laid back (read: spacey) or too exhausted to take on the steady stream of customers coming in after us as well as keeping up with existing customers. Another employee (preferably an alert one) thrown into the mix would have made a world of difference,
After not seeing our server around for awhile, I made the mistake of ordering a beer with the guy who brought us our food. I passed him my ID to take a look at, watched him jot my drink order down, and to my dismay, he was never to be seen again. Wait, I take that back. I was just reminded that we saw him again when he was hanging out and chatting with friends outside. What a coincidence that he was ready to go back inside (in a hurry) just as we made eye contact while leaving the restaurant! When our waitress did eventually come around to see if we were ready for the check, I mentioned my long lost beer and she confessed she hadn't received word of it but was not apologetic, which would have improved the situation for me. It took a bit longer but I received my beer and my check, which of course is a disconcerting combination when I had initially wanted said beer just moments after ordering our food. I drank it quickly in an effort to make our way out of the place in a timely manner but regretted not getting to savor it happily with my meal. Another thing I want to mention (with has absolutely nothing to do with the restaurant's service or the food) is the fact that their water is not purified. This is a non-issue for me in Albuquerque but the tap water in Phoenix tastes remarkably like pond scum to non-Natives such as myself who are well adjusted to better quality water from the tap. I think making an effort to provide customers who are drinking and need to stay hydrated with clean, filtered water free of charge would give businesses an edge in AZ.

Overall, I think this restaurant is being managed poorly but has potential. I wish the employees were a bit more keen on doing their job because I'm sure they're all nice people who I'd like to say sweet things about. I'm not sure if it's a chain, I'm assuming it is, but If they opened one here and it wasn't understaffed, I could potentially frequent it based on the beer selection alone."}
{"text":"Complete and utterly heaven! 

Going here on a really empty stomach is your best bet...because you will want to eat every single last crumb of your pizza dough. And well...because it's dough, it will fill you up fast. The touch of molasses they add is what really makes this the best bit of heaven. I don't know how else to describe it since I find myself having to wipe the drool off my chin each time I try to think of a way to say it here.

My friends and I started out with their garlic and parmesan pretzels. They make these with the same dough they use to make the pizzas. Not too garlicky and just the right amount of parmesan. Mmmmmmm.

I got the Philosopher's Pie which has mushrooms, sliced steak, kalamata olives, artichoke hearts, and a garlic/olive oil base (rather than red sauce). Sweet sassy molassy! I've always liked my pizza pretty plain (think Marghuerita) and have to have sauce on my pizza (since it's usually dry without it). But this, THIS, was perfect! I was afraid it would be overpowering with the garlic base, but nope. 

And it made for the best leftovers, heated up in the oven not the microwave, for 2 days after bringing it home.  

Our servers were super friendly and fun as well. Thanks! It's probably better that I don't live closer to MM, because I'd be a rolling ball of dough if I did."}
{"text":"No line seats open still had to wait for a seat, another 15 for a waiter, another 45 for a small pizza for one person. Got up walked out and nobody noticed. Some of the worst service ive ever seen"}

{"text":"I am going to be generous with my 3 stars because I love their pizza and decore however I feel they charged to much for what we got plus the service was slow for not have my but 3 tables my husband says this is why he doesn't like this place that no matter which one you go to you get bad service. But since it was my birthday he took me"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Pizza place. I would  take visitors from out of town and promise them they would have the best pizza ever. The crust is delicious and good toppings. What a disappointment today. We ordered my favorite Shitake pie and it was completely ruined as for some crazy reason the chef has decided to squirt cheap mayonnaise all over. Mayo on Pizza? It tastes vile and ruined what was once a delicious Mushroom and cheese combo. If Mellow Mushroom can go back to their old recipe minus the mayonnaise I would go back as it was wonderful"}
{"text":"Initial impression when arriving set my standards high as well as the hype over this place. I love the decor and feel of the place itself, but the pizza was over-priced for thin and hard to eat cause the toppings just slid off. Also ordered the cheesy bread which i'd honestly prefer Little Caesar's over here. 
The waitress was nice but disappeared for loooong periods of time. 
I'd be willing to try again but try something other than Piza cause the Calzone looked good."}
{"text":"Nice spacing, good music, great food! Our server \"Dante\" was fantastic! Very attentive with a friendly attitude. Definitely recommend this for a grouping point to start or finish the night."}
{"text":"Last week, a group of us went into the Mellow Mushroom restaurant in Tempe to have a \"quick\" lunch before a 1pm meeting. We got there at Noon, ordered and then waited, and waited, and waited. At 12:50pm I told my waitress that I had a 1pm meeting and please run my card now so I can take my food and run to my meeting. Well, I get my food at 1pm and it is the wrong order. Argghhh!! So I have the waitress send it back to the kitchen and have one of my coworkers bring it to me, but I am still waiting for my card which I gave to her 10 minutes ago and I have to go this meeting that I am already late for. My co-worker signs my card and I get my cold food later and again it's the wrong order. I eat it anyways and can't lie, it tasted really good.

Fast forward to today, where a co-worker and I had another 1pm meeting. We decide to work through lunch and order take out from them and give them another chance. I make our orders at 12:05pm and the girl says that it will take 20 minutes. So I go to pick them up at 12:30pm and they aren't ready. So again, I wait, and wait, and wait. While I am waiting I hear the kitchen manager and a server talking about a table where the customer was not so happy about having to wait so long for their food and was trying to get a discount. At that moment I hear the kitchen manager refer to the customer that is arguing this as a \"douchebag\". My jaw just dropped at what I have just heard. I have to go outside because I don't wanna hear more. So I continue to wait until I get our food at 12:55pm, 30 minutes after it was promised to me, we end up having to eat our food during our meeting. Uggh. 

Now the food is great here, they do an great job at this but the customer service is absolutely dreadful and that is being nice. Surprising because there is usually 25 people working in there at one time. I do not recommend Mellow Mushroom unless you have a lot of time and patience, and don't mind the kitchen staff calling you \"douchebag\" and other names behind your back. I'll pass"}
{"text":"This place has a genius for a beer purchaser behind the scenes and she's more than willing to ensure she is leaps and bounds ahead of her competition.  There is a catch: Proper beer glassware is non-existent and the bartenders don't seem to care about the luxuries their purchaser gets for them to sell. I wish I had the chance to talk with their purchaser as I am sure she has some great stories to tell and some excellent beer recommendations. Storage space seems to be the reason why the beer glassware is lacking however if they had some snifter glasses they would be a must stop every week!  Get some snifters and bartenders that care about your products!"}
{"text":"Some of the worst service I have experienced in a long time.  The place wasn't even half full and our appetizer took 40 minutes.  The food was good, but not great.  The beer selection is great, but the waiters don't know anything about beer.  It is a real shame that this location is so bad, I have been to others that were great."}
{"text":"YUCK!

Went on Valentine's Day.  Was given a bad table and the service wasn't really good.

I ordered a pizza with steak - it wasn't that good.  The plates had a strange damp smell and I started throwing up hours later.

I am unsure if it was food poisoning or a fluke that I got a 24 hour tummy bug around the same time.  

I wasn't happy when I left and will certainly never go back!"}
{"text":"Trying to get seated. Can see tables and booths wide open. They said trying to not overwhelm the kitchen. This is poor management and horrible service. May leave to go to Danny Boys or Deweys Pizza."}
{"text":"The food and pizza were great!! We picked it up to go and the hostess Nayla was so nice and helpful.  Prices were very fair as well. Strongly recommend the \"Great White\"!!"}
{"text":"Best baked wings :P love the Funky Chicken Pizza (their version of a BBQ chicken pizza) Great deal with a Groupon deal of $10 for $20 & combined with Happy Hour worth trying out."}
{"text":"Love this place! The build your own salad is brilliant and sooo good not to mention the pizza is amazing. We've been here quite a few times and had nothing but amazing experiences!!!"}
{"text":"I visited the Mellow Mushroom several days ago with a friend at her urging. 
While I loved the decor...takes me back to a much better time..it was way too loud for us to have a conversation. I was excited to try the pizza but can honestly say I wasn't impressed. I think the crust was bland with too much of a sweet taste.To me if the crust isn't good then it doesn't matter what you put on it!  I was torn between a 3 or 4 star rating but decided to go with 4 because of the other food I ordered. The mushroom soup was fabulous and the Greek salad was very good due to the house dressing which I loved. Not sure if I'll be back but if I do go, I'll definitely get the soup and salad again! Even though the decor is geared towards us 60's hippies, I feel like it is more of a family place."}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere is really fun, the food is phenomenal, and the service is very good. Reading another review, we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and it was the best I've ever had! The only complaint I have is that the kids meals were very small. Our kids are 5 and 7 and both were still hungry after eating the Mac & cheese and pretzel meals, respectively. But wow! Overall so good! Worth the 30 minute wait on a Friday night for us. :)"}
{"text":"I love Mellow Mushroom.  I saw where another reviewer posted a statement comparing MM to Papa John's and I don't agree at all.  I like Papa John's for \"big box store\" pizza, but they don't hold a candle to MM.  The pizza crust, fresh ingredients, and great craft brew beer selection make for a great eating experience.  I agree the stoner thing is inappropriate and the service at this location leaves a bit to be desired but, all in all, it's hard to beat the 'Shroom."}
{"text":"Drink selection is excellent! However pizza is dismal. Crust is absolutely disgusting and it was overcooked. Service was good and bartenders were great. I would also recommend the app pretzels with beer cheese. If you're looking good pizza, avoid this place. It's overpriced for what you get. Go local and order a pie from NYPD pizza."}
{"text":"We came here a couple weeks ago and the service has not gotten much better. The waters were left empty. My sisters soda tasted funny. The waitress didn't even bother checking on us after we got our food instead she was behind the bar playing on her phone. My fianc√©'s hoagie was slightly cold. There was some flies flying around. This place needs to be truly re-evaluated. Every time I go here it seems to just get worse unfortunately. It sucks because this place is so close to home and a great place to eat and drink at late at night but I think Bj's Brew House is a better option. I don't know why this place hasn't improved. Hopefully something replaces this place or it improves."}
{"text":"Been here twice - once for lunch, once for dinner. 

Mellow is a bad name considering the location is where the old Z- Gallery was on Mill - warehouse style, exposed brick and tall ceilings, very bright lighting and slick laminate flooring. Not a place to break out the incense. (Perhaps the original locale was or some of the other franchises are, but this is not)

Lunch: small Greek style salad, toasted bread thing and soda - decent, good value
Dinner: Portobello mushroom sandwich with red pepper, feta and sprouts - GROSS! It was so bad, I had maybe 2 bites before I threw in the towel - which is very rare for me I assure you, I am a notorious plate clearer, whether I am full or not. The mushroom was meely, gritty (not washed?) and very bitter and the toppings flavor didn't blend with the rest of the sandwich.

I tried my husbands medium wings -  they were slimy and luke warm at best when they were delivered. My friends got the cheese pizza and they were unimpressed by it. Maybe we just were there on an off night, but after our last visit I won't make the mistake of going again."}
{"text":"Just had an extremely unfortunate experience at this location. 
Went for a quick bite and drinks with a friend and we sat in the bar area. Tried to order drinks and the bartender asked us to pull our IDs out and he'll be right back. Roughly ten minutes go by and he has yet to come back,  another five minutes go by and appetizer he put in for us had came out, still no sign of him. Tried to get his attention and he gave major attitude, asking if we even had our IDs out yet. While I get he was the only one running the bar/bar area, he definitely wasn't too busy to fuck around with his coworkers. So honestly I will not be coming back, there was no need for attitude or the extremely long wait on our drink order, because there was no one in there."}
{"text":"Tried to go eat here tonight. Had the worst experience. I am usually a very patient understanding customer, especially since I know this is a new location, but this was just unacceptable. We had a large party 6 adults and 4 kids, two of which needed high chairs, we told them just that and that we needed indoor seating. We were told it would be 25-30min. After about 30 min a hostess came over and asked if we could do a booth. We said as long as two high chairs could fit that wouldn't be a problem, well I guess that wouldn't work because we never heard anything until half hour passed. Then I think who must have been a manager came to our party and said they were out of high chairs so if we wanted to hold the babies until they came available we could be seated,again annoying, but fine. He then took us outside to be seated only there wasn't even a table available out there!! So we stood awkwardly by people eating while they scrambled trying to find some tables and chairs. By then we were so done and went across the street to red robin and had an excellent meal and great service.  Put a bad taste in all of our mouths and we didn't even get to try food."}
{"text":"Great location! 

They have a lot of creative pizzas. We got the veggie one and it was okay. I think I was expecting more flavor and I just didn't get it. The service is okay, not a lot of pride in the job, but we didn't feel neglected either. 

One of the major perks is the patio. On a beautiful day, you cannot beat sitting on Selwyn, watching one of the tvs, and enjoying the sun. 

This is A-OK in my book, a lot of hype, okay pizza, great location, but not itching to get back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Place is awesome! The food is great! The drinks are strong! The staff is friendly and really nice. 

I had the thin crust pesto chicken pizza. I try not no eat that much pizza but this was delicious. I even licked my fingers. 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have been to this locatin 20+ times. Mellow mushroom has some bomb pizza and calzones. The bar area gets PACKED for happy hour. It is so loud that you can hardly hear your companions. So if you want to have a conversation with the people you come with, get a booth during happy hour. The reason for the 3 stars is the service. It has been lacking big time. I went with 2 people on Monday night around 6:30 pm and sat in the bar area. Our waitress took our drink order and it took over 10 minutes for our drinks to come out (2 beers and 1 soda water...) Mind you we are literally sitting right next to the bar, and even though it is fairly busy, it should not have taken this long. Our waitress finally comes back and takes our food order. The food took over 25 minutes.. we ordered 2 personal pizzas and one small calzone. Again, it was decently busy, but for what we ordered that is way too long of a time. Our waitress never checked in on us during that time not even to let us know our food should be up shortly. She was nice enough when we spoke to her but the customer service from majority of the staff here is just sub-bar. Anyways, we will be back because we love the food, atmosphere, and the beer. Just know that you probably won't get grade-a service here"}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Pizza it was delicious the times this week delicious and I really enjoyed chatting with the waiter. This used to be the old rock bottom. Looks similar now but more open and trendy at the same time.  Definitely a place to hang out with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Holy Pretzel Bites!!! Best on the block!! 

Came here Monday afternoon for lunch and everything was delicious! We split the pretzel bites, Buffalo chicken pizza and a chicken Caesar salad. Food took a little longer than we expected but it was worth the wait! Nice server and management :)"}
{"text":"Service was really slow! And since that is the main part of the experience I'm giving it three stars. The only upside was that the food was tasty. I scored a free Cesar salad checking in. I went with the weekday special which was a personal 8\" pizza. It was a great price for what I received!"}
{"text":"We got the Hot Dang Shrimp as an app and it was poor. The shrimp did not taste fresh, possibly over cooked and chewy, sauce was good tho. The pizza was excellent tasting. We got the House special and ordered a Medium but got a Large which was to our benefit but showed how unorganized the service was. The service was very slow and they seemed understaffed, but everyone was friendly. Good beer selection, and we would have stayed longer to drink but it took too long to get our beers."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people from my rowing team since we were in Cleveland for a regatta the following day. I was initially excited after viewing the menu online, since Mellow Mushroom offers vegan customizations for their pizzas and hoagies. Very few such places do, and in light of that I was looking forward to a great experience. What followed was a disconcerting series of 4-star and 1-star impressions, leading me to give this place the worst rating I've handed out since becoming a Yelper.

We were seated fairly quickly after arriving, since two people in our party had put their names in earlier. We got a nice booth and were given menus and a draft list to look over. The noise level was very loud so we had to raise our voices to say anything to one another; however the vibe and d√©cor seemed sort of hippie/rock and roll so that was to be expected. The truly bad aspects of our evening began and ended with the quality of service, and since our server was attending to us the entire time it sort of colored everything that was good. 

To begin with, once we received menus and the draft list we were left alone at our table for nearly twenty minutes. During this time we were not brought waters or approached by anyone wanting to see if we had questions. Our server wasn't anywhere in the front of the restaurant during this time, so perhaps she was on a break. That I could understand, however the sudden disappearances and general lack of interest in our table on her part only continued. When she did reappear she wanted to take food and beer orders at once. We obliged and she took care to make sure my pizza was properly dairy-free, which I really did appreciate. (This was the reason I kept mentally making excuses for her all evening honestly.) After she left we expected our drinks at least would be forthcoming, since we were all starving at this point. Nothing happened for another solid twenty minutes. It got to the point where I became worried we weren't going to receive any drinks at all or they would come out with the food. A food runner dropped off all of our beers at once, and they were all in chalices. Now pardon my beer snobbery, but none of the beers we ordered were appropriate for a chalice. I hate to sound horrible, but I was frankly shocked. After another half an hour or so, we'd gotten to the bottom of our drinks and were wondering about the status of our meals. Two salads and a hummus plate were dropped off around this time, followed by some dinner plates. Another half an hour had passed before we received the main portion of our meal. During the entire wait our server never once came over to ask if we were in need of more drinks or to give us a status update on our pizzas. Many pizza restaurants warn you about how long pizzas can take ahead of time, but we weren't given that warning or even the courtesy of a check-in. It was a Friday evening and definitely bustling (one of the things we kept telling ourselves during the wait) however the restaurant had begun to empty out by the time our dinner came and we saw our waitress sitting down for quite a while near the kitchen during the main portion of our wait. Had she been attending to other tables we would have felt less overlooked, but in light of that it was rather upsetting. 

The pizzas themselves were absolutely delicious, and based on them alone this place would easily have 4 or 5 stars in my book. We inhaled them in around ten minutes, since we were eager to be headed back to the hotel to rest for the upcoming race. The server came back to offer boxes and we requested the checks at this time. She came back and tossed us our checks, and when offered our cards on the spot (we had them out in preparation) she blatantly ignored them and walked away. It was another ten minutes before we saw her again. This time she accepted our cards and took an average amount of time processing them. We were packed up and immediately out the door as soon as they were returned to us. I hate to sound unreasonable regarding the service we received, but it truly did ruin the evening in many ways. I've heard horror stories about bad restaurant experiences, however I'd never witnessed something like that myself until coming to Mellow Mushroom. If I ever find myself in one of these establishments again I hope I'll come out feeling differently."}
{"text":"Jenna and Brett were awesome the food was great too and it was happy hour so that was a nice surprise. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have been to several Mellow Mushroom establishments. Met up with some friends prior to attending an event.

The location is right in Uptown Charlotte and Happy Hour is filled with locals after work.

The layout and design of this restaurant is contemporary and lots of flat screen TV at first it felt like a sports bar. 

Mellow Mushroom makes delicious pizza. Had the Magical Mystical Tour and the Jalape√±o kicker. The second pizza was a bit too hot for me. Not use to eating Jalape√±o.

When we ordered the pizza's the waitstaff said it was going to take 10- 15 minutes or more to get to the table. It was also a 10 minute wait for the dessert. The Half Baked Brownie Supreme came but we were still waiting for the three pretzels. The brownie was a tad dry around the edges but with a teaspoon of ice cream and whip cream it made it very moist.

We had to leave for a show and went to the counter to ask the pretzels be wrapped to go.

If you were not in a rush or had ample time to relax and unwind after work then this is the happening place to be."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour.  During happy hour the prices are 1/2 off on appetizers and beers.  Great selection of beer.  We got the mixed green salad, and it was OK for the price, but not terribly good.  We also got the portobella mushroom which was also OK, but not fantastic and would have been incredibly expensive outside of happy hour.  Finally, we got a veggie pizza which was also just OK.

All in all, 3 stars or \"A-OK\".  I would have probably been disappointed if I had gone during non-happy hour, though."}
{"text":"Bomb Dot Com. Our server was awesome. Good beer selection. Awesome prices. Happy to have this restaurant in our neighborhood. Keep it up."}
{"text":"March 2016: When they say 'mellow', they must mean how long it takes to come out. Drinks were great, wait staff was great (Aaron was awesome!), food took almost an hour to come out. Once it was here, it was great! But for a Monday night, when it was slow to begin with, we shouldn't have had to wait that long to be served. As my first time in Charlotte, I'd say definitely a spot to check out, if you are not in a rush! 

Update, June 2017: it has been over a year and I came back to town this weekend for my sisters wedding. We went in last night and I figured I'd give them another chance. We only had 3 people order food and it took a half hour + for the food to arrive. The food was hot which leads me to believe it took them awhile to put the order in in the kitchen. We asked for a manager multiple times and that took a a long time as well! The food is good but if you REALLY have time to waste, go ahead. We probably won't be returning. Lowering my rating to 2 stars."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this new restaurant so off we go.  Half price appetizers so ordered spinach artichoke dip...it was good...small serving because it was HH ?  If this is normal size don't pay normal price.  If you build you own pizza like Fired Pie...be prepared to pay $15-$17 for a small..2 others I was with ordered mixture of two different pizzas...they said crust was really good but overpriced.  I ordered meatball sub...meatballs and sauce good but French roll was not grilled or toasted..just a piece of plain roll.  When my bill was received notice she charged me for upgrade to rosemary potatoes...I brought this to her attention and she indicated she always tells customers there is a upgrade charge...I did not hear this when I ordered and she offered to remove from tab...thank you..when she left table my sis said she could of mentioned it but was talking so fast could not understand her.  Sis paid with credit...she was charged my bill amount instead of hers...got it corrected..we hope..she will keep eye on bank account to make sure it was corrected...doubt I will return."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here with my sister and her husband last night.  It was about 6pm and the place was pretty dead.  The place has a pretty decent vibe to it but isn't nearly as eclectic as I had expected for some reason.  I don't know why, but I had visions of this place looking like some Cheech and Chong movie with tie die everywhere.

The beer selection is decent and have tons to choose from both in bottles and on draft.  There is something there for everyone and they are glad to let you sample anything on draft.

I'm a traditional pizza type of guy so I wasn't sure I was going to like Mellow Mushroom's unconventional pizza offerings.  But I have an open mind and you can't put too much weird sh*t on a pizza, right?

While their specialty pizzas are most unique and contain at least what looks to be fresh ingredients, they don't offer much in the way of taste.  I was expecting to be wowed with the great looking crust and flavorful toppings, but I just wasn't.  The crust was too doughy for me (perfectly crispy on the outside however), but the flavor just wasn't there.  They put some type of coating on it and it looks awesome but isn't flavorful at all.  I tried 4 different pizzas and they were all just ok.  They look and sound way better than they taste.  They didn't taste bad, just not awesome.  I mean you are paying \"gourmet\" pizza prices so I wanted gourmet pizza taste.

Our waitress was awesome.  She was very personable, friendly and fast.

Even if it is a chain I think this place is unique and a great addition to Mill.  However, I'm not entirely sure this place is going to last.  I don't know if college kids (or me for that matter) want to shell out over $30 for a medium pizza and a beer or two.  

Pro Tip:  the slices are huge so have them double cut for better sharing."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT experience last night at this restaurant!  We had a super large party of 25-30 and we had pizza at our tables in less than 15 mins!  I called ahead and was helped by the FABULOUS Mae Mae!  The experience was awesome!   We had 10 starving volleyball girls and they all sat together with their coach.  Mae Mae and the staff were quick and fun!  This made our first night in Charlotte at Regionals end on the best note!  Thank you Mellow Mushroom!  Thank You Mae Mae!!"}
{"text":"College student recommend and I agree.  The house special pizza was excellent.  I would stick with the selection of beer and skip mixed drinks.  I will definitely eat here again the next time I'm in Tempe."}
{"text":"Not so good and we are unwilling to return to confirm our negative opinions.

Clever decor and good for kids, esp birthday parties as they have an upper tier that would contain them and not bother the other diners.  That is the good part.

The pizza was flavorless, life Figaro's.  With just sauce it would actually BE cardboard.  On the thick side, no aroma, touch and in our case burned.  Even with toppings it was nothing more than a bad pie.

This was dinner time and the floor was dirty and unswept.  At least they could have swept the dirt somewhere or picked up the napkins and other debris from previous diners.  Agh!

Server was nice and young.  Young as in she was not an experienced wait person so she just took the order and got it out.  When we signaled, best to stand and wave one's arms, she would come by and then go get more iced tea.  Other wise, we were not there.

For an expensive $24.95 large pizza I would expect better.

Bar looked busy and wish we had seated ourselves there, at least to get more attentive service.

Why do people come here?  Are there that many people without taste buds?  Guess so."}
{"text":"Went here based on the reviews on the Social Media outlets like Yelp. Boy, were WE in for a shock when we went to the Myer's Park location on Selwyn. For some strange reason, we were expecting an \"adult\" upscale pizza place. But when we got there, it was laden with TONS of children and we both were reminded immediately of Chucky Cheeses (in atmosphere, not food). And do NOT get me wrong! Families and children are sacred and they have to eat also, but it's just we were NOT expecting this when we walked in.....


We thought about running out, but decided what the heck, we're here, let's try the food. So we did. At least they have a good beer selection, and many on draft. Yeah! I needed it to quell the seemingly thousands of screaming kidlets running amok. 

So we ordered 2 different pizzas as is our custom as my wife and I like different things on our pizza. So after eating them, we were both \"underwhelmed\" for what we got for what we paid for. The pizzas were good, but nothing great considering the money we paid. Total bill was almost $60 for 2 pizzas, 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers. Pretty steep for pie, wouldn't you say?

Overall, they do have a good product and nice beers. But, when you can drive a few blocks away to Portofino's and have AWESOME (NY-style thin) pizza for less, then why come here? And at Portofino's, chances are you'll have a much more intimate time than you will at Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"The last time I had Mellow Mushroom was when their Highland Creek location was still open.  The one on Selwyn is not convenient, so I was happy to hear a while ago that they would be opening in Ballantyne Village.  Most restauranteurs definitely get the demographics of Ballantyne wrong.  It's not the rich old people of South Park.  Restaurants like Table and Solara have closed while Moe's is always busy.  Ballantyne is a suburb within the city, complete with soccer moms and kids.  They want a place to take their kids, and MM fits the bill, as shown by most of its clientele.  Like a recent article I read about them said \"Feed the kings and live like the masses.  Feed the masses and live like the kings.\"

Anyway, onto the food and experience.  I knew they would be super busy on a Saturday night, so I called in a to go order.  I was not surprised to hear the wait would be 1 hours and that was accurate.  I got to the restaurant, found a parking space (few people realize there's tons of parking behind it), and walked into the crowd.  The set up is far from efficient with to go orders as well as people waiting to be seated all crowded into the same tiny area at the front.  Also, this is a good haul from the kitchen so there is a lot of disconnect about whose order is ready.  After waiting in line for about 5 minutes, then paying, I waited about another 5 minutes to get my pizza.  My wings had been sitting in a clear plastic container with 2 cups of blue cheese at the counter the whole time.  My pizza was relatively cold when it was handed to me.  

When I got home, the pizza was correct, but there were a couple of  issues.  First, the slices weren't cut all the way through.  Second, i got half beef and half black olives on it, but beef ended up on all but 2 of the 8 slices.  The dough was nice and thick, which is what I have always loved about MM pizza.  There was a little too much sauce on the pizza but it was okay (we almost always ordered their white pizzas before but I wanted a regular pizza this time).  The wings.  Oh the wings.  Probably the worst I have had.  Ever.  Anywhere.  Tiny, baked, pres-sauced, and possibly even parbaked?  I hope not.  The blue cheese was runny after sitting in the container for who knows how long.  I realize this place is new and slam packed, but please don't short cuts.  

The 3 stars is because the pizza was actually good despite the issues with it.  I'll have to go back when they settle down a bit to dine in and hopefully bump them up a star, but I'll never get wings from them again."}
{"text":"Pricey, but worth it lol. The food is exceptional and the service is always great. My family and I come here probably once a month or so for a fun family pizza date. The BBQ chicken pizza is incredible, and even my kids devour it. This place has a great atmosphere and is very casual. The booths are big and comfortable and they offer a decent kids menu and coloring stuff for the tikes. The salads are on point as well, although pricey. They offer gluten free options for you crazy people who can't eat delicious bread. I would have pictures for this review, but the food is always so good that I end up digging in before snapping a picture. It's certainly worth a try if you have never been."}
{"text":"Love the funky q pie as well as the house pie with all the toppings. Beware the gluten free crust tends to be either doughy or very crisp (I actually prefer very crispy, well done crust), the gluten free crust here tends to be crispy. Only downside with pick up is parking if you are driving there."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to Mellow. I've  never been disappointed. The crust is white and wheat with molasses which is delish! The egg and  pancetta pizza rocks! It has whole eggs cracked over the top and baked. Philosophers pie - steak portobello olives feta mozzarella artichoke hearts on a olive oil garlic crust was good but not my overall fav.   The Magical
Mystery Tour has spinach jalape√±o and I think sun dried tomato on pesto crust yum! The all meat is good too! I just noticed the beer list. I don't drink beer but there was a chocolate one listed."}
{"text":"Ordered two pizzas for pick up on a Saturday night, which I understand is a busy time. However, the hostess put me on hold twice, and each time I had to ask again to order something to go. When I got there, one of the pizzas wasn't even on the order and therefore not made. I should've checked at the store because when I got home, the second pizza didn't have the correct toppings. So whoever took the order failed, hard. 
That being said, it was pretty good pizza, I'd just like to try the pizza I ordered next time."}
{"text":"Walked up and got seated immediately in a booth. Server was very friendly and knew the menu/specials very well. 
We each ordered wine and got it quickly, but too bad the glasses were dirty. 

We both ordered a pizza and they took about 45 mins to come out. 

Another reason I gave 3 stars was because it was bingo or Jeopardy night and the man announcing was VERY loud. It ruined our conversation because we couldn't hear each other, so we asked the server if we could move outside. They were cool with it and it was a beautiful day. 

We heard that the manager was the person doing the game and he basically forces all the customers outside every game night. Hmmmm 

Delicious cheese pizza for me and an overcooked/burnt gluten pizza for my friend."}
{"text":"I came here over the Thanksgiving weekend with family for the Goose Island stout release. This was the closest place I could find it and was hoping to enjoy a few nice pours. I was completely appalled by the 5oz pour for $7.50. I ordered anyways and received my beverage in a lowball bar glass... WTF!!!!!??????  Had I not been with family I would have made a scene. 
Pizza is whatever and has way too much crust. They try and get crafty with toppings but skimp on everything. That much outer crust should include some dipping sauces or honey. Something.
Overall, not impressed. Applebee's meets Dominoes with a great beer selection and people that aren't educated enough to know what they're pouring. I'll go to the liquor store and grab a Lotza Mozza next time."}
{"text":"Already a big fan of mellow, but jerrod was awesome. Great service and attentive to detail. Great service."}
{"text":"Sadly nothing has changed. The fact is if your over 25 and believe that service is important this is not the place for you. Huge place with approximately 25 patrons and 25 workers. This time I went with 3 people or 2 couples. We were seated and then forgotten. We watched other \"kids\" who came in after us order and get drinks, then place there food order it was obvious that we would have to get up and ask for a server. After 22 minutes we did.  Wow we can order. Server asks us what we would like and we ask for the extensive beer menu which could have and should have been given to each person when we were seated. He returns with one and stands there waiting for our order. Yes 1 for 4 people and wants an instant order. So finally we order and in only 15 minutes we get our drinks minus 2 that he forgot but did return in 10 minutes with the soft drinks.  OUR FOOD order came out quicker than the drinks but interestingly the other \"kids\" who had come in after us were already DONE EATING AND GONE.

Chopped salad looked like I had asked my kids to make it. We upgraded and ordered chicken to be added and found that it and some black olives were the only chopped item on the plate. It was served with two tiny plastic cups of dressing hardly enough for the salad but it was fine with us as we didn't eat it.  McDonalds would not have served this and perhaps the management should hop in their car and go to Picazzo's and see a chopped salad. Pizzas came out and were average and on one there was no sign of sauce anywhere under the cheese. Perhaps they forgot it or there was so little it went onto 1 slice.

Well we would have loved to have had more drinks or refills but a table of girls came in and for 30 minutes it became the only important thing for our server. Finally we gave up and one of us walked to the hostess and asked for our check. About 15 minutes later he arrived with the bill and just left it on the table in between all of our dirty plates, glasses and silverware and walked away.  

It was extremely hot the night we were in and every 5 minutes a young guy wearing a camoflouge shirt or hat I don't rememeber was adjusting the A/C.  I am not sure he even worked there as everyone else has on black t's.

In my 1st review I suggested this restaurant would be struggling during the summer when they would have to count on locals for support. 25 people on a Friday night might be a true indicator.  The manager asked me to come back in and give them another chance.  Same result. Sorry MM but look up and down Mill and see restaurant spaces empty because they assumed the kids of ASU would support them and keep them in the green."}
{"text":"Not sure If it was opening day jitters or just bad overall.   Staff was friendly.   Appetizers were good, got the free Brushetta it was good.  But it took almost an hour for the pizza, and when it came the Buffalo chicken was mostly crust very little toppings at all.  We got two smalls to try two different types the 2nd was the one w everything and it was a bit more hearty but still wasn't the best.   Probably won't be back... not really into paying high prices just for a name.  But on the up side the place was cute,  lots of tv's and a full bar.  The management staff wasn't very intentative consider most people were waiting a very long time. Woukd of been a nice touch if while they were walking around they would of let people know they were backed up, and the dining room wasn't even full."}
{"text":"I've been to Mellow Mushroom before for pizza (super great 10/10 recommend)  so I decided to check it out again tonight, but this time got a Caesar salad with chicken. I liked the fact that it wasn't doused in Caesar, but the chicken was incredibly dry. My friends got the cheese chicken sandwich, one of them as a pita one on multi grain bread with the red potatoes instead of chips. They both really liked their food, said it was great. Our major issue was that we didn't even know who our server was. We initially were greeted by one girl, had another approach us for a drink order, had another drop then off and take our food order, another check back on us, had someone else bring checks, and it switched with who processed them, it's as if we had 3 servers. It took forever for someone to come back and get our desert order, and just very unorganized. Food was great, service was sub-par. I'd probably come back, for the pizza mostly, but I'll make sure to sit at the bar like I had the first time for better service."}
{"text":"Great food, the pretzels with beer cheese are awesome!! A great happy hour!! Our server was great and prompt!"}
{"text":"We received a coupon in the mail, so we decided to try it. 

Ordered the mighty meaty pizza. The crust is really good, but the meat was kind of gross. Like ground beef with zero seasonings. Wish I could've picked it off, but it was baked into the cheese. 

All in all, I wouldn't order from here again, and I'm glad I didn't pay full price. 
Maybe with a coupon id try a veggie pizza, but I don't think it was worth $26."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. But they changed the menu and eliminated a lot of the vegetarian options. Also I asked for a side of banana peppers for my sandwich and they charged me $2.39 extra.  Who charges that much for a garnish of peppers??!!  But if you have a salad and add peppers it's only 99 cents. 

I tried the new mushroom sandwich that the waitress said was very similar to the veggie sandwich that was taken off the menu. Not good. I'm sorry but this place has gone down hill. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Not sure about the other locations, but the one in Ballantyne is horrendous. I mean one of the biggest cluster F's I've ever experienced in my life. They refused to seat us at a 2 top table in the outdoor area because a \"party\" was coming which NEVER came the 1.5 hours we were there due to terrible service. We were sat in the middle of the floor at a high top table and waited 10-15 min just for drinks. Ordered the mild wing appetizer to which the server said \"we don't have mild\" and which was clearly stated on the menu. Once bringing this to her attention the response was \"oh\". My wife ordered a Mr. Pibb and the server said \"what is that, I have never heard of it\". Uh, take a look at your soda machine like my wife did and you will clearly see Mr. Pibb as one of the options which is also clearly stated on the menu to which the server said \"Oh, I\"ve never heard it called that\". My wife specifically said Mr. Pibb because that's what they serve so I guess what it really says is that for our first time eating there we knew more about the drinks and menu option then our server did. The wings were horrendous with zero flavor and came with no dipping sauces and we ordered 1 ranch and 1 blue cheese. Another server realized this and kindly brought us what we ordered. 20 min after that our server finally came and took our order and when it came out she brought us the wrong pizza so we waited again for the correct one. We asked for utensils 3x and the restaurant said they \"ran out\" but again, another server kindly brought us some because our server couldn't seem to be bothered by bringing us any. This is after she tried to leave dirty appetizer plates that we had used for wings on the table and tell us to use those for our dinner. So to sum it up, long wait for food, incorrect order, no utensils, no napkins or plates, wrong order when it came out, incompetent server and manager who also couldn't remember jack crap, and food was bland and definitely not worth the wait or the $$$. I mean it starts at the top, so if the manager can't manage the restaurant herself then that explains the cluster for the rest of the restaurant. The manager asked us 20 min after we received our wings if they had ever came out, then we asked her for utensils and of course she didn't remember to bring any so what was the point. Do yourself a favor and don't let the \"cute little patio area\" draw you into this disaster of a so-called restaurant. There are plenty of others in Charlotte to choose from."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at the Mellow Mushroom. The food is great. We had the wings. Our waiter was Parker and he is AWESOME! He is certainly in the right profession. Parker is a people person and aims to please customers. He has a great personality! I will go back because of Parker. If you visit Mellow Mushroom on High St, request Parker. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The place is awesome. Donte has great customer service. 


Every time I been here I have enjoyed the pizza and the service was great 

I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Went with a friend to grab a mighty meaty at 7:30ish on a Saturday night. As expected, the place was mobbed. Even with the place being packed we had a good experience. Didn't see any of the issues in previous reviews present. So either they are getting their shit together or it could be a case of yuppie Ballantyne folks getting butthurt cause of to of many \"skateboard looking kids\" working there. Anywho, i was prepared to wait. Got a buzzer thingy and was told 45 min. The bar was packed but we went around to the far side of it and were able to grab 2 stools. Got the beer menu, it looked a bit more expensive than the last Mellow i was at in Winston.  We asked about specials and one of the bartenders said they didn't have any but a passing server chimed in and let us know they had some drafts for $3, sweet.  A different bartender ended up taking our drink order and he was cool. Went with PBR's at first and then switched to the drafts with our food. Fyi: On the menu it says they are tall boy cans. They actually are only 16oz taller cans not the 24oz tallboys. O well. Within about 30 min our table was ready. Our server was super nice and very attentive considering how slammed the place was. Even asked us when our beers were only half empty if we wanted another brought out in about 10 min. Awesome. Our medium mighty meaty pizza was yum. Crust was very good and there were plenty of toppings on it. We were in and out in about an hour and a half(including wait time). The bill with one pizza and 4 beers came to $32. Not a bad deal at all. I will definitely be back. Stoked to have a Mellow Mushroom so close to the hizzouse."}
{"text":"The food was decent. Funky q chicken pizza was good. Didn't like the hamburger pizza as much. Environment felt good and music was good but the waitress took too long attending to drinks and order. Will eat again but recommended the first visit to not be on a very busy night."}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door and the host was nice but as soon as we sat down the service just stopped. After literally 20 minutes we decided to leave due to no one acknowledging us without even the slightest smile. The food looked decent but we will never know, and due to the lack of service we will never return. If you are looking for a place to be treated as if you don't exist then Mellow Mushroom is the place for you."}
{"text":"Hadn't planned to go to MM but TGIF across the street has closed!!  I'm a wine drinker so I was glad to see on the menu a good selection of Chardonnay.  My glad turned to sad when the waitress said all they had was the cheap selection which in my opinion is undrinkable.  The waitress said 'we aren't a wine place' -- well why is it on your menu???  Prices are good.  Pretzel bites were delicious."}
{"text":"Super slow service. The pretzels were just flat out yucky, they were hard. The pizza was okay, pretty skimpy on the toppings. There was no feta & literally 4 pieces of sun dried tomatoes & a few very finely sliced onion. The crust is different & a bit soggy. Never offered a drink refill. Had to ask for the waiter to take our menus. 
 We will not be back."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went to the Mushroom on Mill for Happy Hour.
We had been there before, but never took advantage of the HH specials - half off drinks and apps. 
This is definitely the times we will go back over and over for.

The food is good, though not necessarily great. During previous visits, we usually ordered a pizza and a beer or two. Any other time it seems as though the cost for this is usually a but higher than I would normally like.

During HH we were able to order a couple of things off the \"Munchies\" menu. 10 wings for me (under $5) and spinach dip with pitas for him (under $4) and we were able to have about 3 craft beers each. For all this, we paid much less than if we would have just gone out for a pizza.
Bonus - We used a groupon $10 for $20 and it applied during HH!!!

The tap list is pretty decent as well.. Definitely not bad for a chain restaurant. Good stuff and they seem to update on taphunter.

The staff is a bit hit or miss at times with friendliness/attentiveness, but this trip we got to meet and chat with the manager Aaron. He is a superstar!! He was so friendly and nice and made us feel so welcomed and like we were old friends/regulars! He knew his craft beer as well and was able to recommend something amazing for my hubby who gave him 2 thumbs up.
I really loved his demeanor and honestly, I will return to this Mellow Mushroom again and again because of him and those HH specials!"}
{"text":"Food and beer are always good here!  But service tonight is awful!  Been here 20 mins now and haven't even gotten a drink!"}
{"text":"So good!! Greeted as soon as we walked in :) taken to a table within minutes even though the place was super busy. Lacey James welcomed us quickly and enthusiastically described the happy hour specials and the rest of the menu. She even offered to let us sample two beers we were curious about which led us to purchase two 20 ounce adult beverages. So awesome :) we ordered the spinach dip, and it was just as tasty as Lacey promised. For my entree I trusted Lacey again and ordered the Portobello sandwich. Lacey was right again!! Tasty tasty tasty. We will be back. Give Lacey a raise!"}
{"text":"First off, I love Mellow Mushroom!! With that being said...This place needs a lot of help.

We went here on Memorial Day for some drinks and pizza. There was a wait but most of the tables were empty. We figured they might be short staffed. We then sat at the bar and got some drinks. The beer selection is superb and they offer a lot of local companies with unique beers. The bar was attentive and probably the best experience we had the rest of our visit.

After being seated, no one came over for 30 minutes until we finally flagged down someone. No one was assigned to our table so she volunteered. Finally, we put our order in and it was another 45 minutes until our pizza came. The pizza was piping hot out of the oven and delicious! We got the loaded potato pie and it's always a winner. When we went to pay the bill, it took another 30 minutes for our waitress to pick up our check. 

This was probably the longest I have ever waited to eat something and I've been in parties of 20 people at a restaurant. There were only 4 of us. I hope things get better in the future since I love not paying for parking on Mill."}
{"text":"The appetizers were okay. The drinks were okay. The pizza was okay. The service was okay. Everything was oooooookaaaaaaaaay. Man, I think this mushroom is starting to kick in..."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! I was first introduced here by a friend. They offer Groupons even occasionally. I definitely make sure I snag one before they run out. The funky Q chicken pizza is to die for. Which I imagine all of them are! But since I've eaten this pizza I never get anything else. Their appetizers aren't that great for the price though, that's the only downside. Tried the brucetta, wings, and garlic bread. Nothing great. I also recommend not to sit in the bar area preferably of you aren't there for happy hour... Service isn't that great in that area. But the dining area, I've never had an issue. The waitresses and waiters are phenomenal. Keep doing your thing Mellow Mushroom! I've even signed up for their app to gain points! That's how much I love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Been coming to this location for lunch on Friday for a while and that unfortunately stops today.  Server was ok, but an hour and 15 minutes and got our checks before our food - and then the food wasn't right.  Damn Mellow Mushroom, guess this is where we part ways.  Don't believe the \"0 minute wait time.\""}
{"text":"Nasty pizza and good service do not equal 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time in and what a place to be at. Great food, great atmosphere, overall great for the family. 

Will be back with the whole crew and for some date nights."}
{"text":"Thank you, Mellow Mushroom for saving my Vegetarian/Vegan soul. There aren't any other places I've found in Charlotte who have Vegan options for pizza. The vegan cheese Daiya that they use is quite delicious. The servers have always been pleasant despite being extremely busy. Chances are you will wait a while to be seated bc it's pretty popular, but it's worth the wait. Check it out when you have a chance!"}
{"text":"Went to this nice pizza place in rocky river upon friends suggestion. Thanks to yelp, we got a free lil Greek salad the portion of which was good for two. The ambience is good with lot of paintings an open kitchen where you can see the freshly made pizza being rolled and tossed. The service was very personable and we were given advance notice of the time it would take for the pizza to come out. Surprisingly the food arrived ahead of schedule. 
They are kid friendly. The pretzels were soft. 
The prices are reasonable for the quality of food. 
Pizza's can be split into two different variety. The Thai curry pizza was awesome. We replaced the chicken with tofu. The curry tofu was worth it. The other half was buffalo chicken which was good as well. They have a variety of vegetarian/vegan options."}
{"text":"Ive tried Mello Mushroom at both Norterra and at this location in City North. I like this location a lot better. The service is good and I really enjoy the buffalo chicken pizza with ranch and not blue cheese. The pizza is a bit expensive and I would recommend asking for the pizza to be \"well done\" if you like your crust crunchy, but overall we were happy with the food and will be back."}
{"text":"Fun place to have pizza and salad (The greek salad is great).  Not the best place for pizza but a decent place to meet up with friends for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza and appetizers. Cheesy garlic bread bread, pretzel bites, and the wings are amazing.  Cool atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"I've only been here only once so my review might not be as accurate as it could be.

The mellow mushroom is a very delicious sandwhich/pizza place. When I went, I had the Avacado sandwhich on french and the italian sandwhich on pita. Both were delicious. I believe the pricing for sandwhiches is around 6 dollars for a half sandwhich and 10 for a whole sandwhich. The servings and quality are tops. I would go here for a nicer, casual lunch.

The menu also seems friendly for vegetarian as I noticed a lot of non-meat sandwhiches."}
{"text":"I have been going to this location for a while. The reverse happy hour is awesome. However the dinner services have declined in both service and quality of the food. The last couple times I've been the service has either been slow, or the waiter doesn't get the orders right. It also seems that the kitchen staff doesn't put full effort into the food for quality anymore. While I haven't been to motivated to go here for dinner anymore, the reverse happy hour is great. Half price on drinks and always has a changing beer menu which is nice if you like to try new beers."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place based on the reviews of the pretzels from a friend. 

We came in for dinner with a buddy of ours. Our friend ordered a beer but when the waitress brought it she said they were out of what he wanted but the bartender poured something else to try. Eh, I wasn't a fan of that idea. He had a second beer in mind he would have ordered if she simply said they were out. Instead he was stuck with a Dale's Pale Ale and he's never been a fan. So that was a waste of money, since he didn't want to be rude and ask her to dump it and get him something else. Our server also wasn't the best at refilling our soda/waters. 

I ordered the garlic butter and parmesan pretzels with beer cheese for the table. Three pretzels, three of us...it seemed like fate (although, I wish there had been 4 so I could have had 2). They were awesome!! Cooked perfectly, the beer cheese was so good I would have licked the container clean if I had been on my couch and not in public. 

Each of the guys ordered a pizza. One had the Thai Dye which was tasted much better than it sounded, I can't remember what our buddy ate. 
I ordered the stuffed portabella mushroom as an entree. Their pizzas came out a good 7-8 minutes before my mushroom so they were almost done eating before I got my dinner. Nothing worse than staring at your friends eating while you sit there with nothing in front of you. When our server came to check on us she didn't seem concerned that I didn't have my dinner yet, just assured me it was coming. Keep in mind it took FOREVER to get our pizzas in the first place.

Finally my dinner arrived and it was YUMMY! I engulfed it in as few as 4 bites and caught right up to the guys. I would definitely order this again! 

I understand the hype for the pretzels and despite the fact my mushroom was great (you can't really screw up a mushroom) nothing was phenomenal. The service was lacking. She kept disappearing for a long time, our drinks went unfilled, we were stuck with beers we never would have ordered but had to pay for, and our food didn't come out at the same time, nor did it arrive in a timely manner. 

The next time I'm in the mood for pizza, it won't be for this place. I might be willing to try it again but it will not be my first choice."}
{"text":"We are seriously lacking in the \"kick a** fresh ingredient doesn't taste like a factory made pizza\" scene here in Fort Mill, but I'm more than happy to drive myself 15 min into Charlotte whether we stay to eat or to pick it up to go. (they should deliver to Ft. Mill, I'd totally pay a fee)

Over the course of a decade in the Carolinas, we have tried every single kind of pizza on their menu, as well as the calzones, hoagies, and soups. Anytime we are in Columbia or Hilton Head throughout the year, we know where to get awesome pizza and a beer. The new Charlotte shop is so fun to eat in, we can actually get the kids to stay in their seats.

So yes, we are huge fans and my kids all sport Mellow Mushroom tshirts, it's also the only place in the world I can get them all to eat hummus.

You had me at Magical Mystery Tour. Delish!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out - small Holy Shiitake and a medium Red sauce, vegan cheese, broccoli, spinach and mushroom pizza. 

If you like mushrooms and garlic- the Holy Shiitake is your pizza! I was a little concerned when I placed my order and a small 4-cut pizza was $13.50, but when I got my pizza home and opened it, I realized it could've easily been cut into six pieces. While $13.50 seems steep, it's a specialty pizza and has pretty damn good toppings, and it filled me up after three slices. Now I'm pizza stoned.

As for the vegan pizza, this 6-cut had 3 toppings and Daiya cheese and was about $24.  I'm not a fan of Daiya... I'm more of a Follow Your Heart fan, but I'm not vegan so my opinion is invalid. The vegan was happy though. Next time instead of building our own (vegan) pizza, we would probably get the mega veggie and swap out the cheese. It's less expensive than the one we created and you get WAY more veggies. 

Overall, pretty damn happy."}
{"text":"Great looking place and friendly staff. Was in the mood for Oregano's but their wait was over an hour. So I've been meaning to try this place for a couple of years and tonight was the night. Nice place, good food, good beer selection. This place has a lot going for it. We tried the Greek salad which was awesome. Topped with Feta, Calamata olives, and pepperoncinis. The pizza was hot and delicious as I expected to be. Nice selection of beers and stuff, so I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Honestly best vegan pizza I've ever had. Add caramelized onions! 

The regular pizza crust is great also. 

Server was nice and attentive, also a good place to watch the game. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"Finally the hype seems to have died down enough for us to check out the mushroom.  We arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday and had our seats by 6:45, so I can't complain at all about the wait time.  
The service was GREAT, we were helped early and often by our waiter, who even brought out our daughters meal earlier than the pizza so she wouldn't grow too antsy.  Our pizza arrived in a timely manner, especially considering how busy the place was!  About the pizza... I personally thought that the sauce was way too heavy (just my personal preference though).  The crust is a really interesting flavor, that I can hardly describe in any other word except \"addictive\".  It has the texture of a soft inside of a fresh roll, but with a nice wheat flavor. All in all a great dining experience.  
On a side note... My wife has an extreme allergy to latex, one of the biggest offenders on her list is balloon animals.  While this isn't something we come across a lot, we must be careful about balloons, unless we really want to use the epi-pen.  Tonight there was a young man making balloon animals for the kids at various tables.  I explained the situation to our waiter, who was very accommodating in helping us out by keeping the balloons far away from our table.  So, kudos to them for understanding the out of normal allergies that are present and helping everyone enjoy a great dining experience at the same time."}
{"text":"Omgosh best vegan pizzas around!!!! One slice and you are hooked! This is my after a 14 hour shift, starving, in need of comfort food go to pizza!"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom I really dig you. I've been here twice and I love the pizza's. You can't beat good food at a great price. I've also found the employees there to be extremely nice and helpful. It's a go too place for my friends and I to unwind after a hectic week of work."}
{"text":"the pizza here is amazing! this is the only place ive gone to that even gives an option to do half/half on pizza! i got the half great white and buffalo chicken and it was AMAZING! definitely a super cool environment and the waitress was extremely sweet. will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Nothing good to say. My calzone was burned on the bottom and interior was not cooked at all. Still dough. Very little stuffing in it. The marinara was horrible probably out of a jar. I looked forward to the opening now vert disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I enjoy their pizza a lot. It can be a bit on the expensive side but in my opinion it's worth it. My favorite is the potato one, so yummy! Classic Pepperoni is always a good go to too. I recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"Went for the Pie He Porter, left full of sadness and despair.

Explains the Groupon.

The fact that they consider themselves a pizza joint is a disgrace to pizza makers everywhere. What was placed in front of me was not a pizza. Maybe I'm missing something, but I seriously doubt it.

First impressions were a bit on the creepy side. This being the Ahwatukee location with flashing lights at the entrance, with a Chuck E Cheese feel as you opened the doors. They have this movie theme going on that is equally disturbing. We chose to sit at the bar to avoid a 10 minute wait for a table and the option to turn our backs to the bizarre movie inspired decor.

For the record, our service was perfect. We sat at the bar and never had an empty glass. The bartender was spot on, friendly and accommodating. 

Figured we would try the pretzels made with their signature crust. That should have been our warning to spend the rest of our Groupon on beer. We failed our instinct and ordered a pie.

I can't get over the fact that, A) they consider this crust worthy of anything other than concrete filler. And, B)Why in the hell was there a wait for a table?

Aside from the strange texture of the \"crust\", the toppings were also less than stellar with the freshness right out of the grocery store near by and designed by the mind of a child. The one good thing I can say about the toppings is that they were there, as we were hungry and needed something to actually eat. 

We did manage to eat about 3/4's of our pie toppings before the realization that we were simply eating to eat, and at the same time swirling into an endless pit of depression.

Even the beer didn't help at this point. That alone speaks volumes.

To be honest, I can't even finish this review because of the trauma I am still experiencing after my visit. The sheer horror that I actually attempted to consume this thing they call a pizza and the fact that I actually paid for it."}
{"text":"This place is busy every time I come in! Obviously for good reason because the vibes are great and the food is good however there is always a long wait for food. When we sat down we ordered appetizers and drinks immediately.. it took about 15 minutes for our drinks to get to the table and nearly 50 minutes for the food! It was mostly just frustrating because the tables next to us had arrived after us but got their food 15 minutes prior to us. Perhaps the server forgot to ring in our order but this seems to be a common thing for this location. Regardless, the name is Mellow Mushroom so if you have time to kill and are looking for a place with good food to lounge at then this is your spot!"}
{"text":"I got a large pepperoni pizza and it was very good the crust has like a brush of garlic or something on it I'm not sure but it was very tasty. Then I did get some wings hot wings and they weren't fabulous but they were good.  Another great thing about Mellow Mushroom is that it's open late so if you want pizza and it's 1015 and everything else is closed on a Sunday then you can actually go and get pizza from Mellow Mushroom.

I didn't realize Mellow Mushroom is a bit club like at night so I probably will go back and possibly get some food and some drinks with my husband. They also don't close the kitchen until 1 AM which is just great!"}
{"text":"Last night we decided to try Mellow Mushroom.  We arrived a few minutes after 5pm and were seated immediately.  We ordered drinks, a salad to share and a Calzone.  The drinks came the salad was very good and then the problem began.  After about 45 minutes we asked where is our Calzone.  We were told that there was a problem with the Pretzels and they had to be redone and since the Calzone is made in that oven, we had to wait. Then we were told that they made the wrong Calzone and had to make another one.  OK, we waited and waited.  Spoke to the Manager who seemed disinterested and waited some more.  Finally, the Calzone arrived, not cooked thru (the grated cheese inside was still intact and not melted).  At that point, we decided to leave.  The other tables were receiving their Pizzas and seemed happy.  We spent almost 2 hours at the Restaurant and were very disappointed."}
{"text":"LEGIT PIZZA. A bit pricey, but damn, its good quality pizza. 

Great beer selection too.....this is where I will be glad to blow my diet.

Maui Wowwie..........NEW FAVORITE!!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things and been wanting to try this place for a while. They had awesome pizza combinations, so I wanted to try something out of the ordinary - the Magical Mystery Tour, with mushrooms, feta, pesto, spinach and jalapenos and added sausage. It was good, but I wasn't blown away like I wanted to be (but I am looking forward to my leftovers)! The doughy crust has a swipe of garlic and a little extra cheese, but I think I prefer something thinner and a little burnt from a wood fire oven. I sampled my boyfriend's gluten-free crust and it was good for what it was, but he was missing out at least a little! 

I was impressed by the big draft beer list including rotating seasonal taps. I would go back again for beer and maybe to try some apps."}
{"text":"The best part about this restaurant is the great beer menu. But don't let that take away from the food either. The pizzas are all good or great and the appetizers are as well. But what will keep me coming back is that beer menu. It really is great."}
{"text":"TL;DR- Long wait times. Kitchen doesn't read orders. Management doesn't seem bothered. 

Even though the place was near empty, service to arrive was pretty delayed. Put in our order, and we waited what seemed like hours. It wasn't, but it was long. Reading other reviews first, I should timed it. 

Order came out wrong. They'll send the manager over to take care of it, and it'll be done in seven minutes. Thirteen minutes later, it came out. The food was awesome, everyone enjoyed it. 

Manager came over at the end. Asked how the food was, and scrammed. Way too expensive for the \"experience.\""}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't bad but the service was awful. There was no one there but it still took 10 minutes to be seated then another 15-20 before a server came to take the order. All together it took about 2 hours which I had not intended."}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE!  Mellow Mushroom Corporate needs to helicopter in Gordon Ramsey to whip this operation into shape.  Have been coming to this place since the ballpark opened and it's been a series of hits and misses.  Make that a series if misses and misses.  Was thinking growing pains would be worked through by now, but I just don't think anyone there gets it.  Tonight after our party of three was seated hastily in a crowded section, we noticed the table behind us was having obvious issues with their food and service.  Our problems started about 10 minutes later, when we still had not been approached by any wait staff, although plenty seemed to be running around not accomplishing much (same for the manager who was trying to appease the unhappy table behind us).  He didn't pay us any more attention than our absent waitstaff. 

After running down a busboy to ask him to find someone to help us, a waiter appeared, took our order and then he must have left the building.  The drink I ordered arrived about 20 minutes after I ordered (no exaggeration) and then still later another waitress brought some, but not all, of our food.  So with some our order still MIA, our original mystery man waiter was spotter so we flagged him down.  He acted shocked and appalled part of our order hadn't made it to us.  He said he'd take the missing food off our bill (what a prince... You mean your not going to charge me for food I never got?  A-1 customer service).  And the food we did get was devoid of any flavor.  Soup and salads with zero taste.  Nada.  And on top of all this, the atmosphere was so awkward because you could sense multiple tables around us all starting to fall apart as well.  The absolute worst restaurant downtown, bar none.

I was forced by Yelp to give a minimum star review, but really it should be ZERO."}
{"text":"We ate here Wed, 17May, and while the food was good, the service was inexcusably atrocious.  We opted to sit outside where one other table was seated.  Other than that there were a few folks seated at the bar and MAYBE one or two tables inside (this was about 9PM).  Our server took our order and we never saw him again till much, much, MUCH later.  No one bothered to check on either outside table in the entire 45mins we sat there.  I had to go inside TWICE to ask the teenager who was filling the role of host where our server was as we needed a few small things.  After waiting 10mins after the first request and no one coming out, I had to go back inside and ask again.  Unbelievably, our server never did appear, so a while later, the host came out nervously with an order pad to take down what we needed (two waters and a side of marinara).  Then our long-gone server came out with our check like nothing had happened.  I could see if they were slammed, but the place was a desert, and there was another server working (yeah, actually WORKING) as well.  I doubt we'll eat here again.  The frustration level was off the charts.  Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man. I don't know what happened. We always look forward to coming to AZ to eat at restaurants we don't have in Vegas. Mellow mushroom was always a favorite because they have vegan cheese and this family full of dairy allergies was thankful for that. However this time we were left dissappointed. Did they change vegan cheese brands maybe? Different crusts, different vendors.... I don't know what it is but all I can say is it was inedible. The pizza tasted bland and chalky. $35 of pizza went in the trash. Thankfully we also ordered a salad and wings. The wing were nothing special and the salad was mediocre but filled out tummy's. Time to find a new pizza spot."}
{"text":"Good experience. The pizza was good as we remembered when we last went to a Mellow Mushroom five years ago in Georgia. A little pricey but still worth it. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I will never return here! I am really surprised at how many awesome reviews this place has. First off, the place is on Mill Ave, pretty nice location. The inside was pretty clean but we were unable to sit in the dining room because it was closed? So we had to sit at the bar.

We ordered the cheesy bread and a small cheese pizza. I was extremely excited for this because I love cheesy bread...and it looked so good when it arrived at our table...but ugh it was so average and unappetizing. The pizza arrived fairly quickly but that didn't benefit me at all because it was not good at all. The cheese was so thick that it could choke a horse. But anyways, I give this place 1 star because we had a nice server and they had good lemonade."}
{"text":"Decent crust, unique toppings and fun sides made this a decent choice.

I was at a house party with friends and we oped to get some pizza to go. We got there a bit early and the manager Blake was nice enough to give us a cookie to enjoy while we waited.

We had a white pizza, which was great, but a bit greasy. The crust looks to be partially whole wheat is and very dough like, there was copious amounts of mozzarella  and goat cheese as well as hits of other cheeses. 

The super veggie pizza on paper sounded wacky with Tofu on it but in reality it was just a veggie pizza.

If you happen to be up in this end of the world and want some gourmet chain pizza this might be a match for you."}
{"text":"Very rude staff .... 1:10 and they stop serving food and beer . I will never go back . Very rude staff .. Just wait till more places open up on high street . Good luck.."}
{"text":"In a word, Uninspired.  Sorry to sound snotty, but it just was.  Better than delivery or DiGiorno, but not much else.  Don't get me wrong, the pizza was solid (had a tasty House Special) and the beer specials rock (local brews half off on weekends), but I would never chose this over local staples like Oregano's or Nello's for good pie and beer.  

Maybe it was the service - competent, but sleepy (of course, everyone coulda just been hungover from last night).

Maybe it was the decor - plain and unthemed.  The bar was really disappointing/plain after walking past the crazy 70's style neon light in the window.

Maybe it was the theme - the advertising would suggest some kinda groovy, local-oriented hippy thing, but it feels like yet another short-lived, high-profit chain concept.  Nothing wrong with that, just wouldn't seek it out.

Maybe it's the lack of the brick oven.  I think if you're gonna do thin crusted pizza, you gotta go for the wood-fired, brick oven.  It does so much better with the crust.  Think Grimaldi's.

Overall, it's a solid pizza with good ingredients.  Prices aren't too high, but not too low either ($19-20 for a 14\" that feeds 2-3).  I wouldn't make a special trip here or recommend to a friend unless they were like 10 minutes away.  In my local pizza hierarchy, I think it goes something like this: Pizzeria Bianco, Grimaldi's, Oregano's, Nello's, Sauce, (insert 5 or so Old Chicago-like places), and then Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Awesome place, the jerk chicken is amazing and the late night happy hour is real cool. 
The drinks and all the food is good."}
{"text":"Pizza was great!  Spinach salad advertised pecans - none appeared in the bowl.  Service was quite slow.  The bill needed to go back 3x because of errors...  And it wasn't because I was being picky, it was because of simple math errors!   I'll go back for the food and beer selection however because it's that good!"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom left me a little disappointed last night and it started as soon as I was seated. The bench was soaking wet and so was the table. At least I know they washed it, but gross dude! The servers are friendly and helpful but the food left me wondering if I'll come back. 

Spinach artichoke dip, according to the menu, comes with garlic toast points. What we actually got was just plain pita bread. Also, we ordered it as an appetizer and it didn't come out until after my fianc√© had already finished his food. Not cool. 

We had hoagies, which were decent, but only after we loaded them with salt and pepper. Kitchen, please season your food! The meat was good quality though. 

Just a note, this place is extremely loud. If you're looking for a place to knock back some beers with your friends, it's great.  However if you want to be able to hear each other without yelling, ask to be seated on the left side of the restaurant away from the bar. 

Also there's great Groupons for Mellow Mushroom so take advantage of those, peeps!"}
{"text":"Pizza is very good. Pretzels are to die for. Awesome. Good atmosphere a little loud.  Customer service is good a neat little place to eat. Little pricy"}
{"text":"Awesome beer selection with good happy hour prices, but the service was lacking a bit. I can't say this is always the case because I have only been to this location once. But, the first impression was not great. It seemed as though she (our server) didn't want to be there, and certainly didn't want us to be there. Kinda strange since we seemed be one of the only tables in there, and the place wasn't closing for a few more hours."}
{"text":"Meh. Went here for lunch with my colleagues after our annual department planning meeting.  Our server was far from welcoming, my boss had a long hair floating at the top of her beverage and my salad was mediocre.  One of my colleagues asked if she could have the gluten free crust option for a lunch pizza and the server unapologetically told her that it's only for the larger pizzas.  Really?  You can't accommodate a different crust for a smaller size?  Kudos to them for having vegetarian ingredients like tempeh, but I think that there are much better dining establishments on Mill."}
{"text":"Every damn time.
It's always something. 

That advertise 1/2 off ALL drinks during happy hour. 

There is no asterisk, no fine print.

All means all  

We ordered 2 Funkwerks beers. 
Guess what?

Secret Surprise!

Funkwerks excluded.  That was not disclosed on the placard, or the beer list nor by the waitress. 

Too bad because (in her words)
\"That's just how it is\"

I hate myself for coming back here."}
{"text":"A great place to chill at the bar and grab a few brews, the Mellow Mushroom has been a welcomed addition to Charlotte.  

Fans of White Zombie beer by Catawba Brewing Co will be glad to hear that both locations keep this yumminess on tap!  I've also discovered a delicious white wine here called Conundrum. So creamy and rich! 

They have a fairly straight forward menu but can do almost anything with pizza.  The crust here is my absolute favorite in town. It is right down the middle between thick and thin, has a hint of sweetness, and perfect proportions of crunch and chew. They also do great salads with a huge selection of toppings. 

Parking can seem tricky at first but there's plenty behind and under the Selwyn location. Staff is friendly, and they do a nice bingo and trivia. 

Welcome back, MM, and keep it coming with the great pizza and brews!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great, enjoyed sitting outside while having a Blue Moon.  Boozer and house special pizza were recommended and didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Okay there are some hardcore Mellow Mushroom lovers out there and I get why: this place has the most creative and delicious pizza combinations.  One of my favorites is the Yukon Gold Potato which is like a baked potato with bacon, chives, cheese, and sour cream in pizza format. It sounds weird and possibly gross but it's really yummy -- the pizza is pretty light and the flavors are subtle.

I've also had the olive oil with mozzarella cheese and that is sooo good -- especially with their crust. Seriously, this crust is like crack. You can't get it anywhere else. Some people comment their crust is slightly sweet and it does have molases in it but I don't taste anything sweet, it's just really soft. They dust their crust with some kind of cheese -- also amazing.

There are tons of combinations to try and Mellow really has a lot of \"normal\" pizza options with a plenty of \"gettin' crazy\" ones. I'm never disappointed when I come here.

And if you refuse to enjoy their pizza, they have lots of salads and sandwiches to aid in your rebellion. 

The bar staff and servers are nice and always in a good mood. The decorations are cool and all in all it's a fun place to go. I've been here 4-5 times and it never disappoints. Also, if you're not sure, there is a Groupon going on for the next few days: $10 for $20."}
{"text":"Mellow is GREAT. Happy Hour has tons of great selections and Mike, Brian and Jetta behind the bar are GREAT. Get your ass over here and try it out!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but not worth the 30 dollar price tag, Pizza was small with more bread than toppings. Server was average. Overall a Three because small overpriced pizza, average taste!

30 bucks for a 16\" pizza is not a good value"}
{"text":"I just had the most phenomenal pizza here. It was like potato skins on a pizza.  Figured I would be brave and try something crazy off the menu and it was delicious.  We were seated right away and had our drinks within less than 5 minutes being seated.  Very good service as well.  Too bad I was on the clock or I would have sampled some of their very large beer selection!!!"}
{"text":"SO.......It's my once a year dinner with my dad and we decide on M.M.
WTF?  I was completely embarrassed by the prices.  (sorry dad)

$27 for a white pizza?   That's just cheese right? As I see my father struggling to cope with the outrageous prices......\"Dad, Im not that hungry we can just get one pizza and split it. (There were 6 of us) So we all sat around the table uncomfortably and stared at the remaining 2 pieces, each of us planning to kill because of the hunger pains. 

No complaints about the service or atmosphere. It's just EXPENSIVE to eat here.  ITS JUST PIZZA MAN"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour Monday thru Friday. Half off beers and appetizers. Great beer selection, even had the Four Peaks seasonal Pumpkin Porter on tap! Excellent pizza as well and friendly attentive staff."}
{"text":"Food was great but service sucked. Server didn't seem like she knew anything. Our appetizer came after our pizza. Manager came out and said that the pretzels take 15 minutes to make but waited well over 30 just for the pizza meaning she waited to put in the order. After going to our table a couple times she never realized there was no appetizer. She also kept reaching over us to get dirty dishes while we were eating. I like the location on Ray and even the one on mill better. Won't be going back to this location. The food is good though."}
{"text":"I just LOVE this pizza. The crust is so darn tasty that I rarely eat any other pizza in Charlotte.  

The uptown venue can get crowded - but, assuming there's not a Knights game - we can usually get a couple seats at the bar.  

I like to start with the greek salad - the esperanza dressing is perfect.  And then go for a medium pizza to split between 2 of us.   I love the Holy Shitake pie - subbing a red sauce for the base - or the carmelized onions and portobellas.   Depending on our hunger level, we may or may not go home with leftovers."}
{"text":"Boy was I surprised to find a place like Mellow Mushroom in this area off of the Happy Valley road exit.  Everywhere you look, there is yet another chain.  My friends and I were going to Desert Dragon Pottery, and a quick Yelp search yielded this restaurant.

The happy hour is solid- specials on all drinks and half off all munchies (appetizers).  I'm a fan of the cheesy garlic bread.

There are a lot of beers on draft.  That being said, I'm not sure how great they are at maintaining the pipes to the kegs.  I've attempted to enjoy an Oberon here, but it doesn't taste right.  

There are a ton of topping options which is pretty awesome.  I love the Fun Guy (funghi) as well as the veggie supreme (can't remember the fun name).  The crust is solid.

We've had varied service- from great, to just okay.  Either way, this is likely my go-to restaurant when in this area."}
{"text":"yummilicious!  went on a groupon... was not disappointed!   have already been back!  love it  great salad, pizza, beer selection!  kid friendly, casual... new fav for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is always very clean and has really good pizza. The crust is by far one of the best I've had. Great drink specials late at night and a huge selection of drafts and mixed drinks. They also have some good lunch specials for $5"}
{"text":"So I walked in for a semi late lunch with a friend because we were having trouble deciding where to go and ended up here. Well I was ready to walk back out after standing around waiting to get a table in the dead empty restaurant.

But right before I could make that suggestion someone walked out of the kitchen and offered to show us to a table, okay fine. Sitting outside on the patio it took a solid 5 minutes for someone else to show up and offer us drinks, then another 5 to get menus. Now I wasn't in a hurry on this particular day, but most people are on a time limit for lunch and would not appreciate this kind of service. I'm kind of shocked by the prices here 20+ dollars for a pizza is a bit expensive. So I opted to try a sandwich for $12. I selected a tempeh sandwich which theoretically sounded good on the menu but after it arrived and a couple bites I took out all the tempeh which tasted quite sour and rancid and just dumped a bunch of parmesan and pepper on the remaining lettuce, and tomato and ate it like that. During this whole time no one came by to refill water, ask how I was doing, if I liked my food, or if I would like the check.

I don't really care to come by here again after this sloppy experience I don't really plan on returning, even if their pizza is amazingly out of this world."}
{"text":"$50 for pizza and beer with my girlfriend? I think next time I'll go to Nello's and get 2x the quality for 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant, hands down. I order to-go often & dine in when I can. I love the food so much and I love the atmosphere late in the evening on weekend nights. Also, I'm obsessed with the spicy ranch  I always buy Groupons when they become available & the new calendar card thing is awesome."}
{"text":"All I ordered was a small pepperoni pizza and a soda, but I can't wait to eat here again.  If you don't like greasy pizza, and you're a light weight, this place isn't for you.   But, if you know what good pizza is supposed to look and taste like, and you appreciate service that keeps your drink full the whole time, stop by and order a pie.  Totally unexpected, but like the name suggests, when I left here, I was very happy and quite mellow."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the bartenders are good. Twice I have been there and ordered appetizers and dinner. Both times I've had to flag down my server. One time I asked another server to get our waitress as we needed something after out food was served. No check back. The other server asked us what our server looked like. Seriously?
I gave her the benefit of the doubt figuring that she must have tables in another area of the restaurant. As we were leaving, noticed several servers sitting in the back of the restaurant joking around.
Too expensive to be frustrated at the end of the day."}
{"text":"Nice music, cool and helpful staff, great ambience. Great place to hangout at any time of the day (or night)!"}
{"text":"Pizza wasn't bad and the service was good. My problem is with the damn parking garage that charged me $6 for 1.5 hrs of parking. Note to self don't go to Mill ave to eat because restaurants don't validate parking."}
{"text":"The location of this place, City North, has been struggling a bit over the years with restaurants that can keep their doors open. It's a fun location; several restaurants and stores all within walking distance to each other. 
I liked this restaurant a lot. The patio is quite large and bar access; it's sort of a sunken/basement like patio that is completely covered so it should stay relatively cool during the summer months. 
The menu is classic to a pizza type restaurant... pizza, meatballs, salads. etc. but it offers more as you can see when you visit.
Went here on a Monday night as a very large group and the staff did pretty well... my food order didn't get placed so that was a negative to them but I did understand with the large group we had. I did eventually get my meal, albeit, 45 mins. later, but she comp'd part of the bill to say \"sorry\" that I appreciated. I was impressed with the selection of beers on tap as well. Happy hour specials on drinks was good, 1/2 off I think, and they have a reverse happy hour late night too.
I will check this place out again for a regular date night with the hubby and then perhaps we can work off the meal with a stroll down the street and some window shopping."}
{"text":"The 3 stars are for their amazing beer selection and happy hour prices. They have my favorites on tap - Papago Orange Blossom (local, tastes like a creamsicle) and Rogue Hazelnut. The food is so - so. The pizza is tasty, but so greasy it leaves me feeling queasy afterwards and the rest of the menu is hit or miss. If you sit in the bar area, expect to have your eardrums blasted, too loud !"}
{"text":"Great place for a late night pie and drinks.  My wife is a huge fan of the pear martini, and I love their beer selection.  This is a great option if you find yourself in North Scottsdale or North Phoenix around 11:00 with no where to go.  The vybe is always chill, and the bar is big enoguh where you can pretty much always find a seat."}
{"text":"Plain and simple this is not my idea of good pizza. In-fact I think it's pretty bad. I gave them 2 stars only for having lots of good beers on tap. Otherwise this place is not good. The crust is hard and flavorless. I don't mind crusty crust with a chewy inside but not hard as a rock and flavorless. The cheese was not high quality either, it was flavorless as well. The toppings (veg) were pathetic. Basically this is a Pizza hut with a different name. What is all the hoopla about??? I have no idea!!! I will not be going back! I can get a real pizza from some other place. YUK!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place in Ballantyne. The service has declined over the last month or so. Tonight I was brought the completely wrong order. They did bring me the right one but not until the rest of the table was already finished eating
 The manager was nice about it but did not offer to pay for the item or one of my drinks at least
 Nothing.....oh well, good service managers are hard to find I guess."}
{"text":"The most outstanding part about Mellow Mushroom was the great service. A group of friends and I went here for happy hour, and was unfamiliar with some of the drinks - Mello Mushroom carries a huge list of beers. The waiter made some awesome recommendations, and let us sample drinks. He seemed to really enjoy working at the restaurant, which made all of us happy. I had the grasshopper cider - it had a very unique taste to it, and was pretty strong. I liked it a lot. 

By the way, if you go during happy hour, it's half off of the drinks.

The restaurant was clean and had a relaxed atmosphere. Great staff, great drinks, and great atmosphere - highly recommended."}
{"text":"Come here for one of the best draft beer selections in north Phoenix and a bunch of yummy apps. You won't get service on the patio but otherwise it's a good place for a late night beer and fried food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Most pizza places tend to be fairly typical and vary in quality, but seem common.  This restaurant always surprises with unique flavors and top quality in all of their ingredients.  From the crusts to the sauces to the toppings, everything is top-notch and consistent.  The dough is flavorful with just the right crunch on the outside and great texture inside.

Beer selection is excellent.  There are plenty of non-pizza menu items to keep things interesting and to accomodate for any diet needs. 

One of the top pizza joints in town."}
{"text":"Called on our way to see if there was a wait and told no. Arrived 5 minutes later and told 15-25 minute wait. We waited over 30 minutes despite seeing open tables. Took a long time to get service after we were finally seated. Appetizer was wrong so we declined it but were still charged for it. Server brought wrong drink multiple times - how do you get Sprite wrong? Pizza was overpriced and crust was chewy-hard. We'd seen mixed reviews but thought we'd give it a try anyway out of pizza love. Don't waste your time and money like we did."}
{"text":"Talk about living up to expectations and standing behind your product! You promised and delivered.

The manager at Mellow offered a gift card for a return visit and I received it in the mail yesterday.

Thank you so much. I shall return!"}
{"text":"Beer choice great. Pizza great. Bartender so so. Never approach a customer on his last bite of pizza and ask if you want the check. Especially if there are very few in the place. Just because I'm having a third beer"}
{"text":"It was the most expensive pizza I have ever seen. I had someone call in an order when I got there I got sticker shock it's just pizza it's good no pizza is worth that. Service I don't know it was a Togo order. They will not see or my family again"}
{"text":"We ordered the Kosmic Karma pizza. It's the best pizza I have had in the Phoenix area since moving from NJ in July 2013. I would have uploaded a pic, but by the time I realized I was going to post on Yelp, only one of eight slices was left. I just downed four slices. I feel guilty, but it was so good. Hard to believe this is a chain place. The large pie was $26 after taxes-pricey, but worth it in my opinion.

Kosmic Karma-Red sauce base with feta and mozzarella cheeses, spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and Roma tomatoes with a pesto swirl."}
{"text":"Brooklyn may want to learn to not go more than 20 minutes without checking on her tables. My friends and I came in for a late dinner a few nights ago. W had our drinks then ordered some wings as an appetizer. The food runner delivered the wings. We were finished with the wings and our drinks within 5 minutes. More than 20 minutes went by without Brooklyn stopping by. It wasn't until I got impatient and went to the bar to try and find out where our server went, then she sees me at the bar and finally checks on my table. We were going to stay for pizza but in the end we just decided to leave."}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was not. 
10 minutes to get drinks. Food brought out at separate times. No silverware. Had to walk the restaurant at one point to search for anyone that worked there. Couldn't even find the bartender.  Food runners, dropped food and ran. 
I am assuming it may have been a shift change, due to lack of service but the restaurant was about only about 25% full.  Bummer.

I have eaten at many a Mellow Mushrooms over a variety of states, and I will say, this was probably my best baked pizza, I've eaten from a Mellow Mushroom establishment."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza but is mismanaged.  I constantly walk in and the place is half empty and there is a 20-30 minute wait.  The manager explained they only have 4 ovens and can not serve the entire seating capacity of 220.  They only seat people based on the \"flow of the kitchen\".  Third time I have walked out, I'm done.  Last time I saw them turn away 6 couples in 2 minutes while I stood there when there were plenty of empty tables.  Do yourself a favor and buy another oven, you will pay for it in a week, bad business decisions and losing customers, shame because the food is good, but we have lots of options in River where we have a better experience."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! It took us almost an hour to get just two small pizzas. After we were there about 25 minutes our server came over and told us that the kitchen lost the order. We waited another 10 minutes and still nothing that our server sent the manager over.  In the meantime three other tables around us had gotten their food and left and they arrived after we did. When the manager came over he basically told us that pizzas took longer than what they ordered and walked away. No offer of a free soft drink or free dessert or anything like that for the hour that we had spent waiting for our food. Just really poor poor poor customer service. We will not go back again and we will tell all our other friends and valentine to go to one of the numerous other pizza places around. Bad news...bad customer service, and the manager had an \"I don't give a darn\"  attitude."}
{"text":"Try the Caesar Salad Pizza, an Arizona franchise exclusive, and you won't be disappointed! It comes pilled high with chicken Caesar salad on their whole wheat crust topped with a pesto sauce and mozzarella cheese- seriously heavenly! We normally start with the artichoke appetizer and split a small pizza which is enough to fill two adults. They have a great selection of craft beers on draft, although a little pricey compared to other restaurants, as well as a full bar for non-beer drinkers. I love the d√©cor and how each location has it's own personality. Join their text club for deals and definitely swing by for happy hour!"}
{"text":"There is not a lot to say about Mellow Mushroom. It's some damn good pizza with a buttery crust and perfectly melted cheese all topped with parmesan the pizza is very good. Only one single complaint and that is the wait time. Typically pizza will take around 15 minutes this take double that length, but it is well worth the wait.
Five Stars"}
{"text":"Love this place, They have a great Happy Hour and pricing. sometimes, this is my friday night meal. One of thier only deficits, not quite enough variety in thier draft. Hey, they are not a micro brew so what do I want. They have some great and strange, but tasty, pizza's. Also a menu of other goodys."}
{"text":"Saturday night Pizza. We had takeout. One large pepperoni and one medium \"house special\". The outer crust was thick and wide. When I get a pizza with this oversized rim I'm thinking I'm  paying for bread and not Pizza. The medium specialty Pizza was less than 6 inches of actual Pizza toppings. The type of restaurant that would think that this is acceptable is also the type of restaurant that doesn't care if their product is any good.

On the good side - it's edible Pizza. Unfortunately it's just not that good. Not special in any way. Plus it's expensive. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"Worst crust I've ever had.  Strange place."}
{"text":"The pretzels and beer cheese was delish. The pizza was good too; served fresh and hot.  Our waitress was great, but food service was a bit on the slow side."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for Happy Hour the other day. Great selection of craft beers. The meatballs were really good. Service was good. I was able to take home a pizza for the kids so everyone is happy. I think the signage could be better. You would not know that it was Mellow Mushroom or any restaurant by looking at the front door. It looks like a vacant building."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is all about Happy Hour. Since Mellow is located between my place of employment and my house, I frequent Mellow Mushroom for happy hour at least a few times a week.

The bar layout is great! It's a horseshoe bar with 15 or so bar stools, which are always filled, and some scattered tables and booths in the bar area. There is also a patio out the back door which is attached to the bar. The bartenders are rad, but sometimes get over worked with orders. Mellow Mushroom is packed every day, however I usually never have an empty glass. The bar is loaded with 6 to 8 flat screen televisions which always have sports playing. They have every DirecTV package so if hockey is your thing, this is your bar!

The beer selection is awesome. They have a vast selection of draught (28 or so on tap, even a draught root beer for the kids), bottles (about 15 different \"flavors\"), and a couple different variates of canned beer (MGD, Coors Light, PBR and a couple of craft cans like Trout and Dale's). Draught beer comes in 16 and 20 ounce sizes for \"normal\" beer and 9 ounce snifters for the high gravity beers such as Rouge Old Crusty.

Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom. The 16 ouncers run 6 bucks a pop and the 20 ouncers are 7 bucks. Hi-grav beers are a little more at $9. Bottles range from the 4 and 5 dollar range for normal bottles up to $25 bombers from the Rogue brewery. Cans are a little cheaper at $2.50 to $5.00 a can. The combat to the pricing is Happy Hour. On weekdays, Monday through Friday (for those who aren't completely aware of what weekdays are) from 3-6 PM and from 10 PM to close, Mellow Mushroom has half off all alcohol! This makes it very reasonable, especially $1.25 PBR and $2.00 Tecante cans!

If rewards are your thing, Mellow Mushroom is for you. They have a Beer Club! Drink 75 different beers, get a plaque on the wall (ala Old Chicago) and get your own mug. At that point you get the big beers at the pint price. Along the way you are also rewarded with beer koozies (25 different beers) and free appetizers (50 different beers).

Appetizers are the only food items I've had there, as they are half off during the first happy hour. The homemade pretzels are by far the best. They come in Garlic & Parmesan, Salt, and Cinnamon & Honey. The pretzels are made from the same dough as their pizza crust, which is a wheat bread with a bit of sweetness to it. The artichoke dip and hummus is also out of this world. I'd steer clear of the tomato bisque, it's basically a bowl of marinara sauce. As for other food, I haven't tried it, but they do deliver within a 3 mile radius of the store.

This is THE BAR in the northwest valley.

P.S. 4 star review because of non-happy hour pricing."}
{"text":"I've come here several times, and every time it's never a disappointment. The food is amazing, the service is great and the restaurant has some pretty cool decor. But, it's definitely not a \"hippie\" place, probably because it's in such a trendy area.

Service is also pretty quick, although, almost everything I've ordered there has been one of their many unique pizzas. I did order one of their sandwiches once, and it was stuffed with so much, I had to take half of it home. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Their staff is rude and inattentive. The manager we spoke to was no better. He looked to be about 1-3 years older than me and talked rudely from the get go. When he didn't like what I had to say, he copped an attitude. Go f*ck yourself. We are done here. At that point shut up and get my bill, like I told you. So we can pay and leave instead of argue and hear about your regulations. We DONT care. You're refusing to satisfy the customer, so walk away. This guy just stood there and argued until I cursed at him. Personally, I don't give a shit, that was your bad.

You guys really would rather fight about a $10 groupon than keep repeat customers? That is fine with me. It's very simple to pick another good pizza joint (Recommend Oregano's.) We will just never be back and I'll refund my groupon. Enjoy the $20. It's the last you'll see from me / anyone I know. 

I USED to come here several times a month. I will never visit another mellow mushroom. The food is good but is outrageous in price. If you need anything from the staff, good luck. 

I don't give a damn about the Groupon. Unlike Mellow, they have fantastic customer service."}
{"text":"I absolutely HATED mellow mushroom. Horrible service. The food was okay but way over priced. Management was a joke. I'll never be back. Peace mellow, you really do suck."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my mellow mushroom experience this evening. 

Our server and his trainee were both scatterbrains (not organized), couldn't answer any of my menu questions, and were kinda awkward to talk to.... 

Food took longer than 45 mins to hit the table. Maybe that's typical for this restaurant? It didn't seem that busy though.

I ordered a salad and added avocado to it. I got three small avocado slices on the side (picture less than a fourth of a normal size avocado). I was charged almost $4 for \"avocado\" on my bill. Just as much as I was charged for the steak that was added to my salad.

Overall, my mellow mushroom dinner was disappointing. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time to the mellow mushroom, was very excited. Took over an hour to get the pizza, waitressed blamed the amount of people in the restaurant and how busy they were restaurant was, maybe 20% occupancy. Service was absolutely awful. Pizza was okay but the service really killed it."}
{"text":"I'll just start by saying some of these reviews are whack. It's was my first time here and I liked it. This place is a nice semi-hidden gem in the desert ridge area. I got the spinach artichoke dip, a small pizza with spinach and mushroom and a half-baked brownie sundae! Food was great! Came out in a decent amount of time and tasted phenomenal. Service was great as well. I ate alone, but my server was extremely nice and had a good conversation with me, but didn't hover or bother me too much. Perfect! I spoiled myself to a brownie sundae, not knowing they are HUGE!! Let's just say, since I was eating it alone, I got some strange looks from the fellow customers. I would definitely recommend this place. They have a good deal going on groupon as well. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is our new place to go! The food is spectacular everything we try we try something different every time! We always get great service friendly service from our server that we like her name is Ashley you should definitely ask to sit in her section she's very knowledgeable about the food and has great advice. The cookie with ice cream for dessert is always my appetizer amazing. Thanks Mel mushroom for all the great food and thank you Ashley for the amazing service!!"}
{"text":"There are no words to describe how happy I am that there is a pizza place that has *dozens* of vegan offerings all over the menu, that are all more than good!!!

I ordered a \"build your own\" salad to start with spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, and tofu with herb vinaigrette. The BBQ tofu was not well marinated but it still tasted BBQ-ish. 

We ordered the Mega veggie pizza, and asked for 100% daiya cheese on it, but it came out with only my half with Daiya because I said I was vegan. Disappointing for my boyfriend who now prefers Daiya over real cheese. Otherwise, the pizza was *fantastic*! The crust was nice and crispy all the way through, absolutely no sogginess. A generous amount of cheese too. I brought the manager over to thank him for having so many vegan options available! Sandwiches with tempeh, calzones with tofu and vegan cheese.... just so many wonderful things to choose from besides lame ass cheeseless pizza. 

I will definitely return. The beer list is INSANE!"}
{"text":"Tried this place again today because of a request from the owner. It is nice to see that reviews on Yelp get noticed by restaurant owners and they really care about their customers. I am happy to say the food this time was very good. Portabella grilled hoagie was up to the mark and the sun dried tomatoes inside were wonderful. My friend liked his hawaiian style calzone as well. I would recommend this place again for its food. Giving 4 stars because of the very casual service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome the mighty meaty and Hawaiian style are my favorites plus they have a pretty good beer selection. Also convenient that it's right down the street."}
{"text":"The fact that you guys survived the wrath of some of these reviewers means you have the absolute patience of Job.  Just, whatever you do, don't sit next to anyone or ask them if they have any allergies because, wow, how rude... sitting next to someone as though you're an actual human.  You're not!  You're servers, silly!

In all seriousness, Mellow Mushroom has improved since I last came.  It's not my favorite place in the world, but I really do enjoy popping in for some pizza when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love coming here for drinks after work. They have happy hour til close and I don't get off work til 10-11pm so this is perfect. I never spend much money here but I always leave satisfied :) great draft selection and apps are half off! Only downside is I never know if I'm going to get a server or I have to go to the bar myself lol 

UPDATE: giving this place 5 stars now because I have become a regular and they recognize me and my friends and always know what we want. I like to try and go on night Cory is working. He's awesome! This place really takes of us and we make it a habit to come here at least once a week ;"}
{"text":"Got a groupon and gift certificate to try this place as my coworker has raved about it (she goes to the awhatukee location).  Service was good and lots of beers on tap, food was good but nothing to rave about.  Only 3 stars because when I mentioned my daughter had killed a couple ants on the table, they apologized and didnt do anything else.   Im not one to take the time to do yelp reviews or try to get anything comped but I feel something should have been offered....maybe I should have left a phone number for a pest control company instead of a tip? Beacuase of this I probably won't hurry up to be back or refer anyone to eat at this location anyway."}
{"text":"Okay, some of my favorite things after three visits: 

Sunny- she's there on Thursday nights and she's fab!!!!
Happy hour- half price on most appetizers! YUM 
Speaking of appetizers- sweet Thai chili wings! And spinach artichoke dip! Oh my. 
And finally- the funky q. Chicken pizza


I don't know why the crust is so good on their pizza ... but it might be the buttery garlicky parmesean Cheesy and the crunch when you bite into it but the chewiness at the same time... mmmmm..."}
{"text":"We had a good trip to Mellow Mushroom on a Friday night. Although it felt more like a Chuck E. Cheese crowd or Kids Eat Free night with small humans outnumbering adults 2 to 1. Sure we were mad at first that there was no room to eat on the school bus, but i'm over it. 

We ordered the buffalo pizza and liked it a lot. i mean $20 for a medium pizza seems a little high on my pizza price scale, but that's the way it goes for a delicious pizza in a fun environment.  

They appeared to have some wickedly huge booths that could probably seat more people than i know at one table which seemed kind of cool.   

i was pleasantly surprised at a reasonably priced delicious beer on special for $3 draft on a Friday night. Also, outdoor patio will be nice to enjoy the weather and for those who prefer not to stare at the 1000 mushroom tips decorating the inside."}
{"text":"This was my second time going there and what a horrible experience it was. Just bad customer service, manager and a blonde lady were being very rude. It took almost an hr just to get a fresh pizza. Never again will go back, the pizza was good but for the price and customer service we experienced I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We loved the beer and ordered pizza. It took at least 40 minutes to get it and was so surprised it was cold. We contemplated sending it back and decided to. Our waiter was very apologetic and reordered it.  We had the buffalo chicken and veggie pizza after we received the second one it was amazing. Crust was crunchy and was delicious!  Pizza is as night and day compared to the cold on so make sure it is fresh and hot!  Great pizza and the artichoke dip was to die for!"}
{"text":"I didn't dine in the place but I did get delivery . For the most part I am not a fan of freaky weird pizzas and I prefer them traditionalism you might think different . 

We ordered two basic pizzas to share....and both of us didn't like the crust...weird tasting sweet wheat.... 


both of us didn't like the sauce....like ketchup . 

I note the cheese was actually good but this variation of pizza is not for pizza lovers"}
{"text":"Got free pretzel bites for checking on yelp they were not pretzel bites - they were doughballs but they were still pretty good service was outstanding the people were very nice. But it's hard to say something negative when they're right there waiting on you at the bar so I'll say it now. Very very very skimpy on the VG vegan cheese let me say it again very very very skimpy on the vegan cheese and there's an up charge it figured if there's an up charge you get a little bit accredit from the real cheese that they don't use.  Way too much crust - you have to mellow that out a bit. People are just going to stop coming. I still like mellow mushroom and will return, maybe this was just a bad day. Thank you for all the vegan options. Oh, and one more thing, this location was out of tempeh the day I was there.  This is voice to text so sorry on errors."}
{"text":"Along the ghost-town like alleys that is high street/city north is mellow mushroom. Ate here last weekend for the second time.i say this place gets a solid 4 stars. The service is good, the pizza is good, everything is good. Just not great. Each time we have been in we have built our own pie. We have also had the Parmesan pretzels which I would highly recommend. The crust here is great which is what they make the pretzels out of. It's a nice carb load to give you energy to eat your pizza.

I will probably be back. However, my usual pizza spots (Isa's and barrow's) still have my heart."}
{"text":"The stone baked pizza makes the crust a great not too crunchy taste. The topping were plentiful and such a great lunch for my family. Enjoyed their sweet Thai chili wings, bomb.com. Our server was very chill n friendly. Can't wait to come back for more pizza n wings."}
{"text":"The calzones are the best I have ever had! They are amazing! The atmosphere is great, thus far most of our waiter have been great! I also took the kids for a birthday and we got a free dessert that was almost the size of her head! Both the cookie and brownies are huge and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The salad was terrific just the right amount of ingredients. The pretzel bites and the cheese was good too."}
{"text":"First time here. We ordered from the lunch specials got a meatball sub, wings and personal cheese pizza. Plenty of food for two. The wings were really good and moist. Meatball sub had enough meatballs in it. The pizza crust was great as was the sauce. We will be back when in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch last Sunday since I have been wanting to check out this restaurant. The location is nice and the interior of the restaurant is nicely decorated. We looked over the menu and the pizzas seemed over priced to us. About an avearage of $12.95 for a 10\" pizza which cuts into four slices. We decided to go for the hoagies since they were less expensive and a good way to try out the restaurant. The wait staff was polite but not very attentive. 

The food and service was a disappointment. We waited about 30 minutes for our two hoagies on rye bread. The restaurant was not very busy at about a third full so we did not understand why it took so long. Once we recieved our hoagies the bread was slightly burned and very dry. They were tasty but the burnt bread made it a disappointment. 

Our waitress took our orders and did not check back with us afterward. I see this as a management failure, since if I were to train the staff I would make sure that they check on guest during a 15 minute interval to make sure they are getting their food on time. She took our order and checked with us twice after we got it. Never explaining why it took 30 minutes to make two hoagies. 

Overall I would not recommend this restaurant and we will not be going back. I was hoping for a better experience since it was a light lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I had to go back. I kept hearing mixed reviews, and just had to taste the food for myself. Great selection of beers..and nice menu..everything is like $11-12, so bring some loot.  The thai pizza was off the charts, chicken a little dry, but the marinade was right on. I now have a place to go again on mill..haha.."}
{"text":"Tasty food, good service. The Portobello appetizer could have had more than 1 mushroom. But the service was good & the happy hour prices are nice!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Consistently amazing food and great service. ALL of the servers are amazing. My hubby and I love coming here for lunch. 

The food is always amazing, freshly made, and great ingredients. This is a place where I can feel full from the food but not gross. Some of my favorites are:
- jerk chicken hoagie (with bacon - takes it to another level of goodness)
- avocado hoagie 
- funky q pizza
- enlightened spinach salad

Can't beat the prices of those hoagies, and especially can't beat the lunch specials ($5)."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the superb service from Anthony.  He can read a table and is excellent personality who brings customers to such a great calm and his honesty is beyond approach.  He is the model of top waiters in the industry. Pizza was outstanding with great sweet wheat dough! Waiters like Joseph bring customers back, the company ought to recognize his value! Walt & Kyle!"}
{"text":"We ate here Thurs night. My brother had ordered a coke later than the rest of us and when it was delivered he commented to us that he thought she might have brought him ice tea by mistake since there was no fizzle.  He felt it was flat and sent it back. This happened a couple of times.  All tasted flat to him though he thought mine was fine.  He felt she was serving him from the same dispenser each time.   She said she had tried them all for him.  He was aggravated and told her he didn't want the coke. She said she could bring him a lemonade. He told her to just go. 
(At that point she should have told him she would take it off his bill and walked away.)  But she told him not to raise his voice to her.  (He did not raise his voice or swear or say anything nasty or insulting to her. Just very firm that the drink was not acceptable. )  Then she turned and said she would talk to her manager.
A very young man then came to our table with 3 pizza boxes and told us the boxes were to take our pizzas home and there was no charge   We told him that waitress had overacted and that no one had raised their voice to her.   He left but came back a few minutes later and told us we had to leave or he would call the police!!!  My husband said he should do whatever he felt he had to do but he was still eating and had not done anything wrong and that he was still eating his dinner and wasn't leaving. 
After the young man left once again, I told my husband I wanted to leave. We boxed up our food and left. 

Suggestion: The House Specialty pizza was not as tasty as I had before. No extra cheese as advertised and not anything special. Not worth the expense of this place. Though my husband did enjoy his Maui Wowie Pizza.  And Don't expect fizzle in your machine dispensed cokes and if they are flat do not complain!!! 

Our ages are 65,69, 69 and 72 years old. We were STUNNED to be kicked out of a restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was absolutely horrible. It's gotta be popular just for the kids and interior. How do you do pizza this bad and stay in business this long?!"}
{"text":"A group of us went to the Mellow Mushroom for pizza and beer after work. The restaurant was only about 30% full since it was so early. Not everyone decided to order a glass of beer, but those of us that did had to wait 20 to 25 minutes to be served. The waitress said the bar was very backed up. But when I looked over, I saw them talking beyond the bar and they did not look busy. It was very bizarre. 20 minutes for a beer in a less than half full restaurant? The waitress kept saying that they \"the bar\" were killing her and she apologized profusely. It was really odd. The pizza was good, but ate before beer arrived and then had to drink the beer quickly before leaving."}
{"text":"Fan of the shroom back east but they haven't migrated effectively out here.   They need fewer tables as the kitchen can't handle the floor.  45 minutes to get appetizer and then meal came out 5 minutes later.  The sandwich had onions which I requested not but luckily they did a poor job and only got it on half.  Wife's salad was sad and disappointing. Manager comped entire meal.   Nice. But don't think we will return.   Wait for $10 coupons to drain if you want to try.  It is a sad thing because it is a good place back home but just not cutting it here in Phx.  A bit pricy even had it been quality which it wasn't in case you missed that.  Really makes us question going out at all. It is so pricy and a crap shoot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Saturday lunch, everything was so good and our server was super friendly and attentive. The husband and I started off with the mushroom soup, so delish!! Followed by the mauwi wowie and bleu bayou pizzas. We really enjoyed the jerk chicken on the mauwi wowie. We can't wait to go back and try other menu selections. Our 1st visit was a home run!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here because we couldn't resist the name. Pizza was good. Crust seemed to be whole grain.
I had the Pear martini, and was not impressed.
Appetizer was the garlic cheese bread which was pretty good.
Service was ok. plenty of parking this area of town helped, but not sure we will visit again if we get back to Phoenix."}
{"text":"We came here out of curiosity because we couldn't tell what the place was and the name was kind of cool after we figured out it wasn't \"mellow marshmellow\". The place has a cool diner kind of feel and the logo looks like a mushroom that's high or on shrooms and it looked like they were known for their pizza. To our disappointment, there wasn't a whole lot of items with mushrooms on it, and wasn't until after our server told us there is a special mushroom pizza that isn't listed on the menu and it would also take about 30 minutes to prep. So we got the hummus appetizer which was pretty yummy and the special mushroom pizza that had i believe 5 types of mushrooms on it? It was really good, the crust especially, which tasted like honey wheat. We asked our server and he said it was the molasses they used on it. Definitely worth trying once, but I think there are other cool pizza places I would like to get around to trying too, so it's not really a place I'm dying to go back to. Really great service though! You should get the mushroom pizza if you go though"}
{"text":"This is the best Mellow Mushroom location.  Great high end beer list and an excellent happy hour.  We've been a couple times now and our first server Maverick went out of his way to get us the Philospher's Pie which is no longer on the menu but can still be made.  Our server Anthony yesterday was great too.  I'm not sure who's better they can arm wrestle next time we are there for our table :P"}
{"text":"The pizza is great a little pricy but flavors are amazing! 
Is a place for a family gathering! The one over at desert ridge is a great people watch location!!! Great bar menu too!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. The happy hour prices are great though! Pretzels are a must have (Parmesan and original are my favorite)! Huge selection of beers to choose from. When you're not on a diet... this is a great place to grab some food from."}
{"text":"After the bad reviews others have posted, I was really unsure what to expect. But I was VERY PLEASANTLY surprised!

The dough/crust is FANTASTIC - flavorful, and just the right crispness without being hard and burnt.
It tastes like it might be almost-whole-grain. Not excessive, as in gritty, but just a bit chewy, in a good way.

I had a Fun Guy pizza (yeah, I know, lol) - LOTS of mushrooms - 5 different types - and lots of cheese. Brought home the leftover, and it was just as good reheated the next day.

The service wasn't bad for our large group of 8, although they did screw up the order a bit. We ordered TWO Fun Guy pizzas, but they only brought one. Not a big problem, we simply shared the first while waiting on the second.

The only weird thing is that many of the beers on the extensive beer list are served in CANS - I do NOT like canned beer. For example, all the New Belgium beers, like Fat Tire, which is one of my go-to beers."}
{"text":"Best selection of beer with the best bartenders in town. Great place just to hang out with friends. And the food is great too!! Probably the best crust and toppings in the north valley. If I could only get them to deliver to my house I would make it a ten star restaurant."}
{"text":"Great location right on Mill Ave. They validate parking for the garage behind it at the front wait station. Their Happy Hour specials are excellent you save on both beers & appetizers! I have to say i've never had a bad item on their menu, even the non meat items are delicious and i'm a meat eater thru and thru.  Its a great place to take everyone in the family, you can get single pizza's or huge pizza pie's you can share. They even have salads!! The service could be a little better but i don't really expect much as their mostly college kids working there meaning you get what you pay for. The service at the bar is great just haven't had great service in the dining area.They can accommodate huge groups parties and there are plenty of TV's in the bar area to watch the game and grab a beer w friends. They have a full service bar as well"}
{"text":"After eating here, I'm left with mixed feelings. The food wasn't bad but not great. Got the Mixed Veggie pizza. The crust was surprisingly good, but outside of that, there's not much to boast about the pizza.  

Going with one person made our wait time non-existant for dinner. Other people looked like it was going to be significantly longer. Atmosphere was pretty cool with all the colors and decorations, plenty of large-screen televisions. Sadly, it gets a little too loud. 

Service was okay. Go with a mellow attitude and not be in too much of a rush. 

Nice beer selection. 

Ballantyne is sorely lacking a great pizza place. Your best bet is Wolfman Pizza, but that's a bit of a drive depending on where you are."}
{"text":"I would have scored higher if it weren't for the problems we had.  We ordered for the first time from Mellow Mushroom and it was  delivered to us by Uber Eats.  The food was tasty but incorrect. We  ordered a salad with grilled chicken, pretzels, and a teriyaki chicken hoagie with sea salt potato chips. When it arrived there was no chicken on the salad, the hoagie had grilled chicken, not teriyaki chicken and the potato chips were malt vinegar and sea salt. We called Mellow Mushroom about the errors and we were told we needed to contact Uber Eats since the payment went through them.  Uber did not prepare the meal, they just tendered payment and delivered. Mellow Mushroom was totally unconcerned.  Bad customer service.  I don't think we will be giving them any further business. If you don't care enough to even apologize for the mess up, I wonder how much care is placed in the preparation of the food. Actually, this experience proves how much care goes into it."}
{"text":"I have been in the restaurant industry for 10 years and I wouldn't normally write anything about a restaurant unless I found it necessary. The manager on duty Friday October 16th was extremely unprofessional. He was groomed poorly with a noticeably greasy mullet. He began arguing with a server in a personal manner which seemed like they had a sexual relationship at work. He seemed to hang out in the corner of the restaurant and left the servers to fend for themselves when it became busy which seems to defeat the purpose of a manager. Is it normal practice at mellow mushrooms to have such an unprofessional manager on duty? If so, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This review is for people who know good quality American pizza. The pizza at Mellow Mushroom is fair or just above fair. I give the pizza itself a 5 out of 10 rating. What I am seriously unhappy about is the lack of servers after a certain time. If you want to sit at a table, you must walk to the bar to order and get it yourself when its ready. Same with drinks. Better be careful though, the wait staff will set your pizza on the bar and leave it there. They won't bring it to your table. Pay attention as to when yours is ready or it will be cold. Also, make sure it's yours and not someone else. For the \"help yourself atmosphere\", the bartenders are a little rude if you don't tip. Why would I tip if I'm helping myself? They might as well put a computer ordering kiosk so its 100% do it yourself since they don't want to keep a server on the clock past a certain time."}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were delicious!  The server was very friendly.  Plan to be back and try other things off the menu. :)"}
{"text":"Won't come here ever again. I gave this place a couple of chances and it only got worse. The service is atrocious, the servers and bar staff have such bad attitudes and are so rude. Ordered a large pepperoni pizza, dough wasn't cooked all of the way and the pepperoni tasted old and lacked any sort of flavor. A frozen pizza has better fresher ingredients. This place is wildly expensive for what they offer."}
{"text":"Mellow changed the look of their menu and I'm a fan! Lots of the same great pizzas, but some additional options. 

Plus, Kalie is such a ray of sunshine! I love when she's behind the bar!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came for some drinks during their reverse happy hour. AMAZING deals on liquors and beers. GREAT service. We came really late; about 1:20am so unfortunately the kitchen wasn't open. But we were still satisfied with our drinks and service."}
{"text":"this place was grate it was my first time there I had the karma pizza so good !! the staff was very friendly. I will be deftly be going back . I also like the funky day core and the cleanest of the restaurants ."}
{"text":"After all the hype I had heard about this place I was really expecting something special. What I got instead was above average but failing to live up to the hype.

Tried both the house special (pretty much a supreme pizza) and the philosophers pie. The special was good and the ingredients fresh. The crust was awesome on both. It was the philosophers that was the let down. It just didn't seem to work and the feta was just too strong.

The service however was great and they have a solid draft beer list as well. I will probably come back but this isn't a must stop for me."}
{"text":"Does this restaurant does not allow service dogs in violation of the American for Disability Act. We were just turned away by the manager who would not allow a legally licensed and registered service dog inside his restaurant. I suggest that anybody who utilizes a service dog to avoid these guys like to plague.  It's amazing the uncaring and Cavalier attitude of their staff regarding this matter."}
{"text":"Our second trip to Mellow Mushroom. I think the first time I must have really been a good day for them--or perhaps it was the 2 drinks I had :)

This time we had a gluten free pizza, and a salad. I was really excited they had a GF pizza on the menu. Hard to find, and especially hard to find a GOOD GF pizza.
Sorry to say this one was not good. The crust was soggy, not good what so ever.  The sauce was lacking flavor.The only good thing on it was the cheese.

The salad dressing was very bland, and the salad was small for how big the bowl was. It made me feel that we got gyped! 
The only good part of the meal was the chicken on the salad. I could go back for that every day.

Unfortunately, the bill was way more than I feel we should have paid. The service was not great, the food was overpriced and it felt like a total ripoff.

Sorry Mellow Mushroom--I think we'll pass on trying it for a 3rd time."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of about 10 people. We probably should've made a reservation because we waited a good 30 minutes to be seated (our fault). We ordered 3 different salads and 3 different pies. Of the 3 pies I ate from the BBQ Chicken was the best flavor but I was a bit disappointed there wasn't much chicken on it. It was a half and half pizza so I know those are a pain to make when the other half is a completely different sauce. Their beer selection is decent sized, but choice of beers is kind of strange. At the very least, I found one of my favorite micro breweries on the list and had one. Oh yeah, you can get it in 12 or 16 ounce size. Yay! Our server Nike was a little quiet but dealt really well with a few of the pickier ones of our bunch. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was decent, I ordered the Maui Wowie pizza, it was ok, I've had better. One friend ordered the calazone and one ordered the cheese steak, also the same reaction with ok, had better. The service was beyond slow.  It took over an hour to get our order and it wasn't busy.  Too many other good restaurants out there to revisit Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Meh. I have been twice and I will condense my experience with what I have read (and agreed with). Happy Hour is the attraction. Otherwise you are paying around $8 for a draft beer. Seriously. In a fricking strip mall pizza place in frickin N Peoria. When the bar clears out immediatly after Happy Hour that tells you something is wrong. When they have GREAT draft selection but nobody is drinking draft beer that tells you something is wrong. Guess the locals knew something we didnt. Apps and beers are 1/2 off I guess during HH.
Pizza was good. Better be for the price. But it was good and I dont mind paying for it if its good. I would go back for the pizza. 
Service sucked. Seems to be a constant theme on Yelp with this place. Good at the bar, crappy at the table. Our waitress never checked back so we ordered all our drinks thru the Bartender and got to-go boxes from him. We finally found her sitting at a table jamming a sandwhich down her gullet when we were ready for the tab. I dont think she even remembered she had a table. Pretty lame cuz it wasnt busy (remember everyone had left when HH was over). 
I would go again for HH because my friends like it, but theres nothing else up there. They better tighted sh*t up before the economy kicks in and other restaurants start opening up around them. Has potential."}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome! The pizzas are prices higher than other pizza places in the area but omg they are amazing. You have to try any of the pizzas with mushrooms and you'll love what you order."}
{"text":"I've been here before, many times. The food is not consistent. Some days, AWESOME, others, icky. It's is on the expensive side but there aren't many places in the valley that offer such a great happy hour! And the beer selection is always to die for! The interior have a movie theme guessing since they are so close to the AMC. I do know that each place is decorated differently. The dinning room is large and open which sometimes can make it loud. Their patio is also quite large. Happy hour is half priced apps and half price drinks. Skip the dinner and do happy hour here. It's your best deal. ****In regards to the comment below from mellow, I've told them, they don't care and it's been several instances."}
{"text":"I normally looooovvvveeee mellow mushroom and would give it five stars. I bought a groupon and went last Saturday. We got there at 6 and there was a 30 min wait so we sat at the bar while waiting for our table. The stone ipa was really good and the bartender was attentive. We sat down and ordered pretzel bites with cheese and a half supreme and half potato pizza. The pretzel bites were just okay- They were really small and the cheese was runny but had a good flavor. I would order a regular pretzel next time! Their potato pizza is one of my favorites, but this time it was just not great. It was definitely way over cooked and almost black on the bottom. We told the waitress who offered to make another one but at that point it was already 7:15 and we had a movie to catch. So this visit would be three stars, but when the pizza isn't overcooked it's definitely five stars."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here...don't think I have had a bad one yet, crust is the best part.  Meatball app is the way to go.  BBQ wings were small and over sauced, don't bother.  Cookie sundae...cookie was awesome and this may be weird but the ice cream was REALLY cold, at least it wasn't melted by the time it got to the table.  Service is so so, nothing to rave about but at the same time nothing to complain about.  Going to give the calzone a try on my next trip."}
{"text":"Plenty of tv's blaring pre-season football and a craft beer selection that'll remind you of aisle 12 at Total WIne. (my happy place)
Servers were all friendly and attentive. 

Their pizza is guaranteed to fill you like a blue tick with its thick crust and generous toppings. Two slices and I was bloating like a Macy's Thanksgiving Parade balloon. 

Ambiance is fun. 
Lots of musical instruments hanging from the walls. A cathartic little journey for any failed  teenage garage band.

No waiting. 
Walked in at seven on a Saturday night and although the place looked full, they feature both an inside bar and and outside bar. 
We chose the outside bar since it was me and my Italian buddy who's unable to speak without using lewd hand gestures.

Overall, MM is a pretty decent place."}
{"text":"With plenty of time to kill before our flight, we were in the area and looking for a place to eat. My son is a big fan as we have Mellow Mushroom here in Florida. My husband and I had not been there before, but were happy with our experience. I ordered the Thai pizza, and it was very good. My husband ordered a salad, and my son a large sub. We were all very pleased with our food. Perfect stop on your way to the airport (at least it was for us!)."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter and I went here on a Saturday night after a LONG day of running around and doing errands.  We were really in the mood for some good pizza and a relaxed atmosphere. That's exactly7 what we found here.  Our server, Ashley B. was the sweetest, upbeat, knowledgeable, most awesome girl we could have gotten.  She knew the menu inside out and the beer selections as well.  When my husband and I were asking  questions about different beers she knew all about them and even brought us little samples to try.  We ordered 2 pizzas.  They were absolutely delicious.  All of the toppings, sauce and cheese were fresh, perfect and so tasty!!!!   
I love the atmosphere here and cannot wait to bring the whole family back again soon for another visit."}
{"text":"The staff are great and the food is pretty good too! However, I do not see myself coming here again. When you sit down everything looks ok... If you look closely the place is filthy! I am a far cry from being a clean freak or get hyper focused on something. The floor had a layer of film, dirt, food (with the tables being empty). Looking at the walls and there is spilled soda, beer, and food that was wiped but not cleaned. There was a waft of smoke from the kitchen when you first walk in which tells me their ventilation system is not working to great. The staff is VERY friendly and attentive. However, whoever is I charge does not know how to supervise the staff on cleaning up or cleanliness is not a priority."}
{"text":"Very good pizza.  Gourmet, cheesy, meats and veggies and delectable.  Couldn't ask for a better pizza on this side of town.  Full of flavor and fills your stomach up quick."}
{"text":"Busy place! Always have a wait time on weekends. Great drinks and food. Fried pickles are the best!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good but I expected more in atmosphere. The one on High St looks like it is decorated much more to match the creative names on the menu. This one kind of looks like a diner. 
Great beer selection and amazing names of their dishes. No wait on a Sat night was a definite plus but I expected more."}
{"text":"Great pizza. But a bit pricey...love the meatball app. Been the the Tempe, AZ location, the Columbus location, and this one..love them all..."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this Pizza place. The service could be more alert but the pizza was awesome. I can't wait to go back. Worth the wait which was 20 minutes for us on a friday."}
{"text":"Lissette and Marlena kick ass! I love coming here when they're working as they make a great team! 

The buffalo chicken ranch pizza is freaking amazing!"}
{"text":"I was a walk-in, carry out order, thin crust, medium Holy Shiitake. Was speechless when my order was brought to me. The box was filthy. It looked like someone had spilled salad dressing on it and wiped it off, but not before it soaked in all around the front edge. I was too tired and hungry to raise a fuss and demand a fresh box so off I went with it.

The pizza itself looked beautiful. I love a thin, yeasty and chewy crust and it was all that!

Sadly, the toppings were a huge disappointment.A mushroom pizza should have a generous portion of mushrooms! There was just about the amount of them that you would expect on a pizza with other ingredients. Certainly not anywhere near enough to get mushroom in each bite!

There was a general low level sour taste as well. At first I thought it might be the caramelized onions, but again, there was so few of them that I couldn't blame the sourness on that. Maybe it was the cheese which appeared to be poor quality. So little mozzarella that they should have been embarrassed to serve it. The pizza was dusted all over with a dry cheesy powder that was very unappetizing.

The garlic aioli had very little flavor and I could not detect the supposed drizzle of truffle oil that should have been there.

I ate half a slice and called it quits, despite the good crust. I brought the remainder of the pizza in for a young male co-worker who is always hungry. His remark : \"Didn't you say this was supposed to be a mushroom pizza?\"  Come on, Mellow folks, mushroom pizza deserves to feature mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a handful of times - in fact it is where my wife and I had our first \"date\" - and I've always had a good experience. 

We went last night with a group of friends and my wife and I were the first two there. We put our names in for a table and then went to the bar to grab a drink. I was surprised because it was more than five minutes before the bartender actually addressed us, and there were only about five people at the bar in the first place. The beer menu was crossed through all over the place with beers they no longer had, so I consulted the \"specials\" menu that was a separate flyer. Problem was that they no longer had the beer from the specials menu that I wanted. Womp womp. I ordered something else and got on with my life.

When everyone arrived we got seated quickly and (using my Yelp! check-in) got a free order of bruschetta, which was very good. The table agreed that the bread was firm enough to hold the goods, but soft enough not to slice your mouth open like bruschetta bread at most restaurants. I ended up ordering the Pacific Rim - ham, bacon, onions, pineapple, and jalape√±os. So good. I devoured a couple of pieces and saved the other half for a later lunch. 

Overall the service was good, outside of the initial neglect at the bar. Food has never been a problem at this location, but they obviously need to work on the beer situation. It's always concerning to see when a national chain has menus that someone has manually 86'd items with a Sharpie... get it together people."}
{"text":"Great service. Salad was basic but pizza tasted healthier than any other pizza I've ever had which I liked. Ingredients were fresh. Crust is tasty and is made with what looks like whole wheat bread."}
{"text":"place was empty, the pizza took forever to get there and it is weirdly expensive for pizza BUT it is yummy. 
I wouldn't necessarily choose to come here again, but if I did find myself inside of a Mellow Mushroom in the future, I wouldn't be mad."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. I have never felt so betrayed by a server or a bartender in all of my dining and drinking experiences. I'm not one to normally complain to a manager about anything. If the service sucks, I don't tip. If the food tastes bad, I blame it on the establishment- not the specific server. Tonight was different. A few friends and I stopped in to have a few drinks. We sat at the bar and our first round went swimmingly well. The next round, not so much. I ordered the 'shroom collins' and proceeded to watch the bartender finish what was left of the bottle of tanq. She then pulled out a bottle of well gin to add to the drink. I'm not against drinking well. At all. I'm a huge fan of well happy hours, not against it. But when I'm paying 9.50 for a cocktail, I expect the liquor that is specified on the menu. I received my beverage and asked the bartender if they ran out of tanq. She said no. that she added triple sec.  Because it was special, for me. Nowhere on the drink menu was triple sec mentioned for the aforementioned drink. I asked her again, and said are you sure? I thought I saw you finish that bottle and pull out another one. She said no. that it was all tanq. She then offered to remake it for me; I said no, that I'll see how it tastes. So I debated with my group if I should say anything or not. Everyone agreed that I should ask to see the bottle of gin and see if it looked anything like what I \"thought\" I saw. I asked the other bartender to see the bottle. As she walked over to the mini fridge to get the bottle, the other bartender stopped her and \"explained the situation\". The bartender came over and told me the name of the gin. What does the name mean when I asked to see the bottle? I asked again and they wouldn't show it to me. So we got the check, I told them I wasn't paying for it, and I didn't. I spoke to the manager about it who did nothing...im thinking it may have been a busboy or a high college kid from asu west, either way he said to ask for him next time and he would get me a free drink \"or something\". Not sure what that means... either way, I don't like being lied to. Again, I order and pay for quality drinks. If someone has to make amendments to that drink, that's fine. Just don't lie about it. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"A little pricey  for the best tasting pizza.  Happy Hour specials are good, and it makes for a great place to snack after leaving the bars :)"}
{"text":"This location is unique. Definitely looks like it was not originally built as a Mellow Mushroom, more upscale for a pizza place. We like to get the whole wheat pizza, and pretzels with beer cheese. FYI, the pretzels are whole pretzels, not little pieces like at the Tempe location . It was just two of us so we totally felt like little oinkers with 6 big pretzels and a pizza! Lol! The pretzels are made from their dough so I'm sure the 4 were taking home will be really good left over. We made sure to ask to take home some of the beer cheese because it is the BEST. The only negative is that we sat waiting for our sever without waters for almost 15 minutes, seems no one knew who's table we were. However, I will not give 1 less star because they quickly remedied this problem when my husband asked to talk to the manager. Overall, good place and we'll be back (on next cheat day) :-)"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere here. Also loved the food, obviously. Always heard so much about Mellow Mushroom just never stopped in. We decided to grab a bite before seeing a movie at the AMC theatre next door. We got a gluten free pizza with two different kinds (I don't remember now) but they were both delish. We also got a pretzel (yes I know gluten) we're not gluten free just figured why not get the gluten free pizza.. The pretzel comes with a pizza sauce... That one is no bueno! Get the beer cheese! It's a big bowl of scrumptious cheese and totally made the sub par pretzels amazing. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"First time but not my last.

Today, was my first visit to Mellow Mushroom. We arrived at 11:30  on a Thursday for lunch. There were about 20 guests already, however, we were seated immediately. 

Mellow Mushroom offers a varied selection of entr√©e's and brews. I chose the lunch special: 8\" pepperoni pizza for $4.99. I added one topping and a drink for a total of $9.24. 

My lunch arrived in 15 minutes. My entree was piping hot with plenty of mozzarella, sauce and toppings. The crust was soft and flavorful as was the sauce and toppings 

The service was exceptional. The pizza was delicious. I can't wait to go back for my next visit."}
{"text":"Food is good, not great. A quick place to stop in for a bite after a movie. 

Service, the few times I have been there, have been \"ok\" - but nothing exceptional. I have to ask for my refill, they did not ask me. 

I had higher hopes for this place - so sad they don't live up to them."}

{"text":"Service was a little slow when we sat outside. We were placed at a table and never did find our official waiter. Just got waited on by whoever noticed we were just sitting there. 

But the food was well worth the wait. Got the Boozer, a pizza only at Charlotte MM locations and it was spectacular. Planning on going back just to get the pizza to go."}
{"text":"Fourth visit last month, and the food and service seem to have gotten just a little worse each time.

We were told when we were seated that pizza would take about 45 minutes on this busy Friday evening, which we understood completely. What we weren't told was that everything else would take an hour!

I ordered the Shrimp Hoag Boy and the mushroom soup. Soup was ultra-creamy and ultra-salty. The sandwich suffered from overuse of spices. It was just too much. A single-serving bag o' chips is the side for their sandwiches. What is this, a cafeteria?

The time span from being seated to getting our check was just under 2 hours! It's a good thing we still practice the art of conversation. :-)

There is no compelling reason for a fifth visit."}
{"text":"There's an adage that states pizza is like sex; even when it's bad, it's still pretty good.  Mellow Mushroom disproved this theory for me last night.  On this historic night, I had the worst pizza of my life, and I'm dishing out my first ever one-star review.

We ordered a $9 Greek salad.  The thinly cut vegetables (i.e. pizza toppings) weren't plentiful enough to distract us from the fact that the bagged iceberg lettuce was browning.  I did enjoy the creamy Italian dressing, which they named \"esperanza\".

I can't find anything nice to say about the pizza.  It was an abomination.  The crust was uneven and undercooked in places, and it was very sweet with a hint of cinnamon, like eating a cinnamon raisin bagel.  The red sauce was also sweet.  The cheese was plasticky and tasteless.  Each piece of our \"Kosmic Karma\" pie was topped with a Roma tomato slice and a drizzle of pesto sauce, which now seems like a better alternative to the red sauce, but combined to make the pizza soggy.  And to boot, this medium, vegetarian pizza was insanely expensive at $20. Twenty Bucks!

I can say that the service was good, and I liked the decor.  It's a brick, multi-level building, a remnant from the Rock Bottom that was the previous tenant.  I also really liked the movie theater theme of this restaurant, which was pretty cool.  (I found out that each Mellow Mushroom location has a different theme.  I'd been to one other location that had a much weaker theme, but much better food.)

I was anything but Mellow when I left dinner last night.  Regretful Mushroom would be a better name."}
{"text":"The Irony of this all. I place my order online at 8:37 PM, the email said my order would be ready by 9:11 PM. I arrived about 10 minutes early and my pizza was ready. However, my breadsticks with cheese and Greek salad wasn't anywhere around. Staff went back and said it would be up shortly. I sat and waited until 9:24 PM, I looked up and saw the words; \"patience is virtue\" on something in the restaurant. I got up to check, as it seemed that no one else was concerned. 

I asked the young lady and while doing that, the manager came over with a little discount card of sorts for \"the next time\". I don't know what made him think there would be a next time, but I told him I wouldn't use it, he placed it on the counter and walked away. Hmmmm, okay no there's nothing else you could've done to make me return. Sarcasm...

My food came about a minute later. The same pizza, a salad and my bread. I get back to eat and my drink is watered down, there is no dressing on my salad, nor was I offered any, my pizza was luke warm and my fresh from the oven bread was surprisingly NOT hot.  First time and last time; for some reason I thought they were like a Brixx, I hate that my expectations was so high because now I'm really disappointed and I probably won't eat most of it. $20 wasted...And, I had to spend $2.00 more to buy another drink. #nomoremellowmushroomever"}
{"text":"Good pizza.
Horrible service.
Been there a few times for lunch.

First you arrive to an empty host stand and it's unclear if you're supposed to wait there or just go in.
If you go in, there will be a sea of empty tables and no one to direct you.
Employees will walk right by you and not care.

Once you seat yourself, a bleach-blond waitress named Melissa is great if you're looking for someone who'll pay no attention to you, treat you as an annoyance, walk away while you're ordering, keep you waiting an extra 10 minutes for the check and generally leave you feeling like a speck of dirt that is her absolute last priority in life (all while chatting it up with other tables of \"regulars\").

No food is worth all that.

Now I'm thinking: was it her GOAL to make me want to leave and never come back?
(Nothing else would make sense)
If so, congrats.
It worked."}
{"text":"FRIENDLY SERVICE, DELICIOUS FOOD, FUN ATMOSPHERE!!  I have gone here on several occasions of varying times. it has a fun vibe.  I'm WELL past college age and I still enjoy it.  My fiance and I were first helped by a waiter named Dante, He is very Hippie looking, yet his friendly attentive attitude set us at ease as we had no clue what to choose from the extensive menu.

The server, Dante took our preferences into account and then made suggestions.  We were quite pleased.  We continue to request him as out waiter anytime we go there and as a result we have never been stuck in a food  rut as happens with OTHER eateries.  

Once after requesting his seating area, the hostess proclaimed that he gets more requests than anyone.  It just goes to show that GREAT,FRIENDLY SERVICE and GREAT  FOOD MAKE FOR A FINE EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"We went tonight with the $10 off $30 Groupon. Got right in, no wait. Our sever was responsive and the food was good. Nothing exceptional, but easy and close by."}
{"text":"Come to California dammit! The pizza is AWESOME!!!!! We ordered the Gourmet White Pizza, holy mother of pizza's! It was fresh, hot and tasty! Don't dare me..I'll eat the whole thing, I swear! lol

The bar scene is also cool, they have tons of beer selections, TONS!

You have to try this place...I also heard they have great happy hour."}
{"text":"I love Mellow Mushroom. Wish they had these in California. I always, always order the Sourdough twisted pretzels with a side of red sauce Turbodog Beer Cheese! It is heaven!! 

Great, great beer selection! You will not go wrong."}
{"text":"I go to mellow mushroom almost solely for the drink specials on the weekend for a night cap or a night starter, but have been there numerous times on other occasions as well. The drink prices are wonderful and the beer selection is great. The only slightly negative thing I have about the bar is that the cocktails are inconsistent. Sometimes they are weak and sometimes they taste great which is to expect with the different bartenders. I love the ambiance of the bar and the bartenders are fast and attentive which is wonderful. I recommend this bar to any one who wants cheap good drinks on mill avenue and will continue to do so unless there is any drastic changes. Great job mellow mushroom. Keep up the good work and please never become a dance club like all the other bars on mill!

The food here is good and the service has been great for the exception of one time but I'm here to only review the bar so five stars from me great job guys"}
{"text":"I love Mellow Mushroom and I was excited to find out we were getting one in Charlotte. I've now been to this location twice.  The first time i just picked up take out.  The bottom of my pizza was completely burned and the pizza was so greasy the toppings were falling off.  I know this isn't the usual experience at Mellow Mushroom, so let's just caulk this up to growing pains.

My next visit I decided to sit at the bar because it was a Friday night and there was almost an hour wait for a table.  I didn't realize Friday night is kids eat free night, it was more like a Chuck E Cheese than a Mellow Mushroom.  There were actually two little girls with their babydolls sitting beside me at the bar.  I am happy to report the pizza was great this go around, but I'm still not sure this location has found their groove like the Asheville and Charleston locations have."}
{"text":"This is great pizza!!  

It's definitely on the heartier side.  The crust is amazing - it's thick and a little doughy in the best possible way, with a distinctive taste - yum!  They have an exceptional variety of sauce and topping options, and everything we've had was delicious - try anything with mushrooms or pesto!  

Their soft pretzels are similar to their delicious crust, and the stuffed mushroom is yummy (although small for the price).

I recently discovered this place is wonderful for Vegans!  Their vegan pizzas are delicious - the fake cheese is amazingly realistic!"}
{"text":"Incredible customer service by the GM Thomas. He promptly went above and beyond to ensure I had a good experience. Pizza was great too!"}
{"text":"I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Tuesday's are also $1 PBR all day drink specials. We had the house special which was a 
Amazing!!! I would highly recommend this pizza to all meat lovers. 
The ambiance was also very pleasant. There was a mix of college kids and families enjoying a pizza dinner. It wasn't too loud but there was a constant noise level. 
Overall I would recommend mellow mushroom to anyone and I would also go back."}
{"text":"Lets just says its pizza. I have been here 2 times and I was not impressed. I have only ordered the pizza both times as my main dish because that's what I heard this place is know for. Its nothing special I thought. Its just average pizza and beer place."}
{"text":"So we walk in at 11:15 AM. and the place is completely empty. (This is during peak college year). The disappointment of not seeing any hot ASU broads was only the beginning of a variety of disappointments during this lunch. So lets start with the good. The waitress was nice. Ok, now the bad: I ordered the lunch special pizza which was an 8 inch pizza and a drink for like $6. The waitress warned me that the pizza \"was extremely small\" (at least i think she was talking about pizza) so anyways i ordered 2 of them. When the pizza came out, I wouldn't have been surprised if i saw part of a Digornos pizza box stuck to the bottom of the pizza. What is wrong with pizza in Arizona?! I've never been to big city where saying the word \"Domino's\" causes very moist orgasms.  Mellow Mushroom tries way too hard with the crust, they sprinkle this garlic dust all over it and it sucked. It tasted like you were trying to eat an old shiny piece of bread. The cheese was so thick and rubbery, you could probably use it to cover severe war wounds  This place blew big ones, it had cool decorations on the walls, but i can't  friggin eat decorations."}
{"text":"I will say it again: Magical Mystery Tour...TO DIE FOR!!!  Mmmmmm.  But for my official review, I will also add that the service was great and the atmosphere was a cool/tolerable degree of mellow.  My daughter and I went on a Sunday, midday, so not many other patrons.  Everything was very nice and both of our meals were beyond delicious.  I will definitely be back again...might even plan a visit to Tempe specifically for the Magical Mystery Tour pizza, if the mood strikes.  Yum, yum, yum."}
{"text":"Just went there once for a family dinner while I was in Charlotte. They're out of gluten free pizza dough (and they don't know when it's coming back) and as the only Gluten-Free member of the family it was only really annoying. 

Don't go if you're Gluten Free. Call in and ask if they've gotten it back in stock first."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm at the Norterra Shopping center, Mellow Mushroom beckons to me from across the parking lot. I don't typically have time to stop and eat, though. But, today was different. My wife and daughter were both home on my day off, so we went exploring!

During our adventure, my wife mentioned that she was craving pizza. But, not basic delivery pizza...she wanted REAL pizza.

This was my chance! I mean, we were already running errands up north, so this was the perfect opportunity to satisfy two cravings...my wife's for pizza, and mine for figuring out what all the buzz was surrounding this mysteriously named restaurant.

The place is very quirky. It's got a few quasi-psychedelic pictures hung around the entrance. There are about half a dozen disco balls hung from the ceiling in the atrium as you wait to be seated. Among the disco balls, there's also a moon hung in the middle. On the moon, there are cool little trinkets, ranging from firefighters, policemen (both from the tops of trophies), and there's a network of telephone lines on poles spanning the moon. Very cool.

Now, we didn't have to wait to be seated today...it was 1:00 in the afternoon on a Thursday...not exactly \"prime time\" by restaurant standards. 

My daughter wanted to sit outside, so we requested a patio seat. At first, the hostess told us that the front patio was reserved for a large party that would be coming in shortly. Then, she had an epiphany, and realized that there's another patio off behind the bar. Both patios have a misting system to help you stay cool during the blazing hot summers out here. Today, the misters were going, but they might not have been necessary. The way the building is positioned, both patios are completely shaded by 1:00 pm. It was exceptionally comfortable.

Now, the menu is pretty cool. It offers up great pizzas, though they can be a bit pricey, ranging from  around $12 for a small (10\") pizza, to almost $30 for a large (16\") pizza. There are several specialty pizzas from which to choose, or you can build your own.

Now, since we got there during lunch, we got to use the lunch menu. Here, they offer a personal pizza (8\") for $4.99! My wife got a plain pepperoni,  and I got a bacon/jalapeno pizza. This personal pizza was perfect for us! The crust was nice and thick, and the ingredients were fresh and delicious!

My daughter ordered from the kids' menu. She looked over her choices, and she opted for the French Bread Pizza with pepperoni and cheese. She could have chosen macaroni and cheese, but she was happy with her decision.

An interesting side note...our personal pizzas were only $4.99...my daughter's meal was $5.50...go figure.

So far, this sounds like a rave review, doesn't it? I mean, cool atmosphere, great food...in all honesty, the meal alone, in my opinion, earns this place 5 hand-tossed stars. 

But what about the service? Yeah...what ABOUT the service? I don't know what the circumstances were surrounding our completely shoddy service. Maybe the waitress was supposed to have gotten off right when we came in. Maybe she didn't like the prospect of waiting on a table with a child. I can't say for sure, because I never really talked to her.

From the time the hostess seated us, we saw the waitress 4 times. She came out once we were seated, asked us what we wanted to drink, and left. She returned with the drinks, took our order, and left. After someone from the kitchen brought us our food, the waitress showed up to see if we were alright. Then she showed up at the end to bring us the check and a to-go box.

If that last paragraph seemed curt, it's because I was trying to emulate the waitresses attitude. Also, notice how I refer to her as \"the waitress\". This girl didn't even introduce herself at the onset of the meal.

So, like I said..the actual restaurant was a STRONG 5 stars. The indifferent and lackluster service earns a resounding 1 star.

5+1= 6
6/2= 3

Basic math lowers what would have been an awesome review down to the middle of the road at best."}
{"text":"I love this place. The beer is plentiful, the girls are pretty, and the food is delicious. Nothing beats coming in and getting three giant pretzels for about a dollar each. The service was excellent, Lissett and Marleena  (I made sure to get their names just for this article) were both very helpful when it came to my beer selection, plus they provided plenty of entertainment for my friend and I. The patio makes for a great spot to drink and socialize. Thank you Mellow, I had a great time!"}
{"text":"Wow. Two stars because the food is always delicious but what the hell has happened to the service?

I wasn't even going to write this review because I asked for the manager (Aaron, great guy) and his empathy blew my mind. 

1. My two male friends arrived at 7:30 on Thursday night and asked the host for a table for 4, she seated them outside on the patio and said \"your server will be right with you.\"

2. My bf and I arrive 5 minutes later and walk into the restaurant hoping the host would be there to take us to our friends. Truth be told, the only person in a mellow t-shirt that was visible was the bartender. Mildly disappointing but we spotted our friends on the patio and decided to seat ourselves.

3. We get outside at 7:37 pm. We sit down, look at the menu and I ask if anyone has come by yet because I'm super thirsty. Turns out the answer is no but there are two different servers bringing the other tables food, drinks and service.

4. Around 7:45 the server helping the adjacent table looks over at the four of us so we're hopeful that she's either going to come over and say \"hey I'm your server\" or \"I'm sorry you've been sitting there for 15 minutes, let me see what happened with YOUR server\" but no, nothing. I've had several jobs in the service industry, many of them while I was an overstrained bitch in college, but I never let a table sit with menus in front of them with no drinks for more than 10 minutes, even if the table wasn't mine. I must've been silly for wanting to make sure the place I worked made money from happy customers, not from customers  who's bill you almost had to comp because your incapable staff screwed up repeatedly, without remorse to add. (shout out to Aaron the manager again, you give me hope for the service industry, unlike the people you work with)

5. At this point, I'm slightly irritated but willing to go find the hostess to see if we can get her to grab our server.

6. It's now 7:52, I checked my phone while waiting for the blonde hostess to get back to her hostess stand. 7:54, she sees me and one other couple waiting and slowly (seriously, i've seen people on ketamine move faster) walks back to her stand and addresses the couple first (not a huge deal).

7. 7:55: Blondie is back but has no idea what I'm talking about, \"what table are you talking about? Who?\" me-\"my two male friends sitting outside that YOU seated twenty-five minutes ago and my boyfriend, dude in the hat facing the street.\" her-\"can you like point it out to me, I'm not sure who you're talking about\" mind you, the patio and my table are completely visible, due to the GIANT WINDOWS. I digress...

8. I get her to follow me outside, where I point to our table and make sure she sees who I'm talking about. \"oh, you got here 25 minutes ago? I'll send someone over\"

9. 8:02, a male server, who I haven't seen at all, comes out and says something along the lines of, \"I'm sorry guys (please, I'm not a guy, learn some manners) you've been waiting here for too long, blah blah blah something about miscommunication, what can I get you to drink?\" My friend is pissed because the last time we went to Mellow, they screwed up his order and our other friends order as well and he doesn't understand why we keep coming back. He orders water because he refuses to give them any sort of business. At this point, I get it. The server then asks if we're ready to order food, really? We've been sitting here for 30 minutes staring at the menu, yes, we're ready. 

10. We order the Tye Dye pizza, sans tomato & cucumber with a half order of salt & butter pretzels (hoping those come before the meal as we're starving and thirsty). My friend orders a small Tye Dye, sans mozzarella with vegan cheese added. 

11. Our drinks come out a few minutes after that, probably around 8:10 at this point. Our pizzas follow, about 15 minutes after that so, 8:25. 

12. Since our friend is only drinking water, we feel bad and eat quickly. Did I mention the pretzels haven't come out yet?

13. We've finished our pizza, the pretzels come out at 8:40, we get our servers attention and ask for a to-go box for the pretzels and pizza, and the check.

14. At this point, since they screwed up pretty badly, I'm expecting that someone has the decency to knock off maybe my beer (our bill was 58 total, before I spoke to Aaron) but no, everything is on there, including the pretzels. The pretzels that came after we were done eating.

15. I look at the check and ask to speak to manager immediately. About 5 minutes later, Aaron walks out, looking pretty upset and distressed (we've all been there).

16. I preface everything with the fact that I've been coming to Mellow for a long time, my love for their pizza started in North Carolina a few years ago and I'm going to keep coming back. He's extremely sympathetic and thanks me for being patient. We get $10 knocked off our bill and two $5 coupons in hopes that we will return. I will, but probably only for take out. Damn."}
{"text":"If I could bake a pizza, this is exactly what j would like to come out like. Filled with flavor, with an ever so slightly crunch to the crust. Never over bearing. Great service!"}
{"text":"hands down best pizza i've had since moving to az! i'm a pizza fiend and their shit is legit. SO bomb. i'd rate the margarita i had a 2 but because of the customer service and the pizza, 5 stars for sure!!"}
{"text":"I ate at the one in austin a million times and it was always great.  But this was my second time to this location and I'm not going back.  Burned pizza is not acceptable. Flat soda sucks. And server not checking to be sure everything is ok just makes me mad. So I had to post on yelp. Maybe they can fix this place should be great."}
{"text":"Great pizza for the adventurous and not so adventurous. We had the Maui wowie and the magical mystery tour .... yum!  Also had a plain old Hawaiian service was great, great selection of craft beers on draft.  Reverse happy hour.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Their pizza is probably not for everyone, it is definitely not your standard NY or Chicago style.  However their style of crush is probably my favorite and their ingredients are first rate.  Good beer selection as well."}
{"text":"This is good pizza. The crust is the best I've had. Soft and not doughy. The pizza was so good. For the appetizer I ordered the stuffed portabella. It was very good. Hard making a decision as everything looks so good."}
{"text":"The bomb! Our waiter, Anthony, was amazing at his recommendations! Ambiance was so cool, loved the decor and White pizza was to die for!"}
{"text":"The place was really nice and the staff knowledgable and friendly..I thought it was a little pricey. $33.00 plus a $6.00 tip makes almost 40 bucks for a medium THIN pizza 5 wings and two cokes. I can't understand why people like this pizza. It's super thin and most of it is the huge crust which is doughy and tasteless..I guess that's why you need \"dipping sauce\" which I'm not used to unless ordering from Pizza Hut. They have some huge Beer Menu that's also pricey! $7.00 drafts? $4.00 for a can of Miller Lite? It's not the kind of place I want to sit around and drink in anyway..If I felt like a few beers I would just go to \"Wild Wings\" next door were the mood is more festive and the food better and cheaper. The wings were o.k...nothing to write home to mama about! There's a place called Stevies on 59th and 101 ..I can get better, bigger pizza and more wings for about $22.00...and sit home and drink my own $1.00 Miller lites..Mellow Mushroom is o.k. but I won't go back there..lot of better options.."}
{"text":"My colleagues in our Phx office made the mistake of bringing me here for lunch which resulted in a major carb coma afternoon. They also made the mistake of telling me about the pretzels because I HAD to order those! Hey, they could have brought me to Chino Bandido if that idea hadn't been shot down by a germaphobe.

Yes, the pretzels were amazing. I could have made an entire lunch out of the pretzels, and next time I just might. My favorite was the plain butter and salt. The pizzas weren't bad either. I forgot the names, but one was a pretty standard supreme and the other was Greek-inspired with chicken, olives, artichokes and tzatziki. They were both good, especially the thick, but crunchy crust. I love that there are a lot of non-tomato sauce options here. 

Now if only there was a Mellow Mushroom in California!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Being a beer lover, I was excited to hear that they carried close to 40 beers on tap. I knew I had to go check the place out, just due to that. We stopped by on a Saturday (and then again on Sunday) for beers & food.

When I asked for a beer menu, the server told me that they pretty much no longer carry any of the crap domestics (Budweiser, Michelob, etc). +1!

They have plenty of craft ales and lagers to choose from, so even a budwiper lover can find something good here. To the more seasoned beer veteran, there are a plethora of beers will statisfy your tastes. Everything from seasonal summer ales to stouts and everything else you can think of, from good breweries. They have a large selection of beers from Rogue, Stone, Abita, Left Hand, Four Peaks, Sonoran and many more. Nice to see them carrying the local stuff too.

For starters, we've tried the chopped salad (sans pepperoni) and a parmesan garlic pretzels. Both were superb. The pretzels appear to be made out of pizza dough and they are oh so delish.

For the main course, I've ordered up 2 different hoagies, both times with Tempeh.

Vegetarians listen up! This place has you covered. They've got grilled Tempeh, jerk Tempeh, pesto Tempeh, BBQ Tempeh and Tofu as well.

I've had the \"tempeh hoagie\" and the \"jerk\" hoagie with tempeh subbed in. Both were immensely enjoyed and quickly devoured. If you're a vegetarian that's missing a cheese-steak style meal, get your arse over to Mellow Mushroom and try out one of their tempeh hoagies."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a couple times, and in general the food is really good. Their lunch special acn't be beat, but their service isn't always consistent. Whether to go or dining in, i've had several instances of slow service and wrong orders. If they could just work out those kinks, I'd give them another star."}
{"text":"I finally made it into this place and was not disappointed. If craft brews are your thing you will love the bar. The bartender PJ was knowledgeable and recommended great beers. I felt that the prices for pizza were a little steep. A medium had 6 slices and was about $20. With that being said, the pizza was good and had tons of toppings. I was impressed with the amount of vegetarian options. I will be making return visits."}
{"text":"Holy Shiitake, these mushrooms are superb! 

The Mellow Mushroom fun-loving hippies began serving pizza and cold beer in the 1970s and now have over 180 locations in 21 states. 

This brand new Mesa location has only been open since May 2. Barely over a week, not even two weeks, so with that in mind there will be definitely a few kinks to work out, but I had a really pleasant experience on this first visit.

We were told the wait would be 5 minutes when we arrived and it was just slightly under that time. The interior is very interesting, filled with tons of artwork and lighting to look at while waiting. The elephant by the front door and the owl watching over the interior of the establishment are some highlights.  

Our server seems super concerned about our timeline (if we needed to get to a movie or anything). This is certainly appreciated since AMC is in the same shopping complex. 

Also, our server let us know Happy Hour (M-F from 3pm-6pm and reverse HH, every day 10:30PM til 2AM -- open until 2AM, Heck YEAH! Late night post-movie food!) was coming to a close soon so we could still get HH price on apps and drinks if we put in our order before then. A very cool move on his part. We tried the Stuffed Mushroom (one portobello mushroom cap filled with artichoke hearts, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and mozzarella. Topped with a drizzled of balsamic glaze on a bed of  greens).  It was very tasty. The server offered up this tip: he often orders the Stuffed Mushroom and makes it into a burger. Something fun to try in the future!

MM offers a lot of options with a ton of unique and interesting flavors of pizza (they also have calzones and burgers too). Some flavors include: Maui Wowie, Funky Q. Chicken, Rib Eye Pie, and Loaded Potato. Our server pointed out the local favorites section (worth a look) that offers flavors not seen at other locations such as Egg & Pancetta (olive oil/garlic base pizza, sunny side up eggs and pancetta), Melchacho (spicy chipotle red sauce base, cheese, chorizo, red onion, tomato, avocado and fresh cilantro), and The Caesar! (you get a salad on top).

They offer vegan and gluten-free pizzas for anyone that has special dietary needs, too!

Seeing that we had mushroom (much room) for more food. We ordered two small size pizza pies to try. One of the local favorites: Fun Guy (5 types of mushrooms! on top of mozzarella cheese and house made grilled mushroom vinaigrette) and Thai Dye (Olive oil and garlic base, curry chicken, mozzarella, roma tomatoes, onions, fresh basil, cucumbers and a sweet swirl of Thai chili sauce). Both were so good, it was difficult to pick a favorite. 

Their pizza is great! A mostly thin crust, but with a nice, thick, doughy pillow of a crust on the outside edge. YUM!!!

Plenty of food to share and have leftovers to take home for later. While it might take a little bit longer, Mellow's pie beats out some of the faster, build-it-your-way, pizza places that have popped up all around recently and I'll definitely be back to MM soon for more!"}
{"text":"Love the side salad my wife loves the pizza.
Second visit and both times there is a gap in time from ordering and delivery of side salad"}
{"text":"This place is way too noisy for us older people : P however, we found a nice place by the bar that was away from the crowds and it ended up being a nice quieter place for a friendly conversation.
Hubby and I shared a pizza and out friend got a sandwich. The pizza was outstanding, and our server was great. He checked on us often and was very prompt with refills."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom, wherever I go in the beautiful country that I live in, I will seek you out! 

The first time I ever had your pizza was 10 years ago in Blowing Rock, NC. The fun eclectic atmosphere pairs well with the perfectly done crust of the pizza. Although it was a plain cheese pie--I knew you were special. 

When I found you in Charlotte, NC, I began to really appreciate the depth and breathe of your menu. I'd order your pretzels for a giggle and be taken by the dipping sauces you include. 

I've become an avid adventurer though the different varieties of pizza on the menu--the Hail Caesar and Magical Mystery Tour top my list. 

Please continue to expand your reach!  Take a chance and venture into NYC! Please!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I love pizza, I eat too much of it and so does my husband but we have both agreed this is the best pizza we have had in Charlotte.  I'd seen this chain around in other places but never tried it out.

The location of the place is great and the atmosphere inside is cool, they have an old bus that's painted you can sit inside and all of the servers are nice and friendly.  There's always a beer special that's decent and pretty cheap too.

On to the pizza, I've been more than once and each time we have gotten the same thing.  Pepperoni and Mushroom pizza, I'm sure all their other flavors are amazing as well but this one was so delicious we just stick with it.  The crust is a little crunchy but still chewy, the cheese is melty and salty and the toppings are great.  I was stuffed and still ate my entire half of the pizza (I think we got the medium sized one?)  

Anyway, it's not the cheapest place in town but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin! My family and I went in a few weeks ago to have lunch, kind of excited to try a new pizza place.  We ordered a pretzel appetizer and it was okay, the marinara sauce was not very flavorful. We then ordered a create your own pizza and it was horrible, the sauce had absolutely no flavor and I could have had better flavor by licking sandpaper. The waitress was okay, but never came to ask how our food was and in all honesty if she would have asked I would have told her, but I didn't want to make a big deal about it at the time. The selection of beer looked pretty good and my wife and I said that we would only come back just for happy hour to have a beer.  We did go back this passed Saturday January 4th and let me tell you that I will officially never set foot in that place again. My wife and I went in for a beer around 11pm and we sat there for a few minutes before we were acknowledged. The bar top was almost full, but there were two bartenders so in my opinion it wasn't that busy. A heavier set guy with a hat and tattoos came over to get our order. We ordered two beers, my wife got her beer and they told me that they were changing the keg for my beer. It took on my watch 15 min to get my beer and my wife was completely finished with hers. The guy never came back to let us know what was going on because at that point I would have just chosen another beer! He brought it over and just said sorry about that. What really sent me over the edge is when a blonde haired female that I am assuming was a manager because she was walking around with keys on her hip and talking care of something in the computer for the bartenders, never even came over to say anything. I then saw her take a to-go cup from the back side of the beer taps put it through to the front and began to pour beer into it. She then walked over to the other side of the bar and gave the cup to the guy who served us our beer. He walked out from behind the bar and went to drink the beer from the cup. This place is a joke and obviously has their priorities all screwed up."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the Thai Dye pizza and the Greatful Dead drink. Go there, get those two items and die happy, you can thank me later.

The decore is a kinda cute spacey theme, lots to look at. The patio is dog friendly so that's a big plus. Although when we ate on the patio last week we had about 5 people stop us while eating and ask us for money. That's why I'm not giving the place 5 stars. It has nothing to do with the food (which I loved), or the service (which was excellent), but just the people walking by. Unless its busy on the patio I would recommend sitting inside."}
{"text":"Ok. So I walk in and ask to sit on the patio. I received a dissertation on how if I sit at the front patio, I won't get good service because that server has to many tables.

Now, if I want fast service, I am to proceed out the side door under the TV and pick a table. So, I did. 

Now, I sat, and I sat, and then, I sat some more. No water. No drinks. No menu. Just what I believe to be the smokers side of the patio. Not an issue if I have a drink.

I waited a bit longer for the benefit of the doubt. I have been here many times but never suffered this.

Finally, I got up and left for PF Changs and had a great experience.
I'm not slapping you Mellow Mushroom, just sharing my last experience.

{"text":"This place is cool. It has a lot of craft beers. So that way you can go and tell all your friends you had a triple IPA with hops that are grown in a specific region of the world that has a northern exposure so you know they are good. Then your friends will judge you for sounding so pompous. Oh and the pizza is dope."}
{"text":"Went a few weeks ago, service is still awesome but I am really really disappointed that they took Papago Orange Blossom off their draft."}
{"text":"Great prices, beer and food!! The spinach dip is amazing, love the late night happy hour and pizza is fantastic!!! Love the pepperoni and black olive. They currently have Papago Orange Blossom on draft, my fave beer!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! And our server, Cory, was one of the friendliest people I've met. Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"It's not always easy to find vegan pizza spots in the Valley (though Green and Z Pizza are a couple of great options), which is why I was stoked to find Mellow Mushroom.

The spot has been open for about 3 weeks now, breathing some much-needed life into the often-desolate CityNorth and joining other Tempe and Happy Valley locations (there are more around the country).

Think of it as a pizza joint touched by the hippie spirit, with a giant mushroom mascot and colorful music-inspired artwork covering the walls -- good vibes all around to complement the vegan-friendly menu. And if eating animals is your thing, there are items for you, too.

The menu's specialties are the pizzas, but it also includes soups, salads and hoagies. On a recent visit, we started with a Stuffed Portobello ($9), a mushroom topped, not stuffed with artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes and feta cheese. I was really disappointed with the portion size of this appetizer, and the taste wasn't anything special. Thankfully, the appetizers also include the tasty-sounding pretzels, which come in both sweet and salty options.

My boyfriend got a Kosmic Karma pizza, which I actually preferred over my own pizza even though I'm not the hugest pesto fan. It came with mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes, feta and spinach. All the toppings worked wonderfully together, and the dough was soft and bubbly with a dusted parmesan crust.

I tried the Melchacho, a pizza special to the CityNorth location. It had avocados and tomatoes and an interesting chipotle sauce base. I now know I'll probably avoid cheddar cheese on my pizza in the future -- the pie reminded me more of an item from Taco Bell than a pizzeria.

On a later visit, I tried a veggie hoagie, which came with avocado, sprouts, tomatos and mozzarella cheese, along with chips. You can get hoagies on wheat bread, and I thought the meal was really filling -- I preferred it to my pizza, especially because it seemed like the healthier option.

Despite not being completely thrilled with the food I ordered, there were lots of drool-worthy items on the extensive menu that I'll be trying out soon. And it's nice to see another cool place pop up in CityNorth, too!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great.   Old movies in an old brewery. 

Food is delicious   Pizzas and calzones are yummy.  Wish they offered fries.  Lemonade is tasty. 


Service is slower than I would expect for such an expensive place.   Waiters disappear and only take your order.  Never see them again. It's a higher dollar place.   I expect better.  The servers really need to be more attentive to the customers."}
{"text":"Food Poisoning (Salmonella) is what we got!  My husband and I took our 4 kids here Friday night 11-25-11 Black Friday.  Ordered the all meat pizza.  Our 7 yr old didn't want it.  So he got the PBJ and apple off kids menu.  He never ate the pizza.  My husband and two daughters ate some of his apple.  My other son and I didn't.  Later that night my 7 yr old son complained of headache and stomach ache.  He started vomiting.  Next morning my 13 yr old daughter complained of same thing and vomited all over.  Then an hour later my husband started vomiting and terrible stomach pains and explosive diarrhea.  My 17 yr old daughter then got headache. She went on to a baseball game.  While there she vomited terribly in the bathroom all over the floor, toilet and herself.  Very humiliating.  The drive home was an hour and she was so sick. My 16 yr old son and I are the only ones not sick.  The apple is the only common denominator.  Fevers set in and back/neck pains.  I have never cleaned up so much vomit and crap in my life.  

I called MM manager and told him. He was clueless.  He couldn't understand how an apple could do this.  Hello?  What do you use to cut the apple?  Where did you cut it?  Did you wash it before serving?  Did the cook wash his hands after touching raw meat before he cut the apple?  Figure it out!!! Before you get all your customers sick to death!   OMFG.   Mellow my ass!  This food poisoning was nothing like Mellow.  It was awful. 

We have been here 3 other times.  First time they burnt our pizzas.  The other two times were ok.   Pizza is not bad, but not my favorite.  Very disappointing. We won't be going back.  I'll find a better place to spend a $75."}
{"text":"The pizzas here rock. I'm not a crust guy but theirs abide. I like the crust w/ a bit of parmesan cheese and crushed red pepper. The pizzas are hand tossed and made to order. The ingredients are fresh and the choices vast. Love the Maui Wowie - pineapple and bacon! You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I ain't gonna lie, their pizza isn't my favorite. It's creative and interesting though! But this review isn't about the pizza, because that's really a matter of personal preference. I want to talk about the people. 

I'm a beer guy. I love microbrews and craft beer. Mellow has an ever changing (and extensive) list of beers on tap, and while my favorites aren't always available, I have faith that they will cycle through again. Taphunter can help you find any number of places that have excellent beers on tap. What it doesn't tell you is that your bartender can be part of that experience.

John, Corey, Lola, and the rest of the gang (that I don't know on a first name basis) are really why I come here. Not only are they top notch barkeeps, but they know their stuff. I've walked in and, without a word, been presented with a bottle to try. The suggestions have never failed to amaze.

The regulars are a community as well. These aren't your typical bar-flies. They are cool people with a passion for good drink. They are colorful, diverse, and full of stories. 

You might even happen in when a brewery rep is in, pimping the product. It's a great way to learn about what is up and coming.

It's no exaggeration to say that I love this place. If you owned a bar, this is the kind of place you would want to have."}
{"text":"OK I did not eat here, so I cannot comment on the food, I had a few beers here, and they were served at a good temperature, and with a smile by a very nice BT!
I enjoyed the atmosphere of the place, and the food that was coming out to other patrons looked just fine.
The Beer Selection is quite good with several local breweries being represented, which is always a plus for me.
My only complaint is that with a selection that good they do not offer Beer Flights. This should be a NO BRAINER, they are huge money generators for any good Beer Bar, and this is one of the only ones I have been to that doesn't offer them.
My suggestion to management and corporate is to get with the times, and offer flights, many Beer Lovers like myself wanna try various beers without having to commit to full pints.
Trust Me, you WILL Make Money!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to the Mellow mushroom locations , I  leave thinking it tastes better everytime.  Their pizza crust is outstanding.  Just wanted to give them a big thumbs up for their Excellent food, great atmosphere and service!"}
{"text":"Hands down, Mellow Mushroom has the best pizza I have ever had.  I have been to both of their locations and have never been disappointed.  Love it!"}
{"text":"WORST PIZZA and experience I have ever had. 

I have been to Mellow Mushroom three times and each time the experience gets worse and worse. The service is terrible. Each time the mess up someone's order. This most recent visit, we ordered 3 pizzas. It took 30 minutes before they were ready and only 3 of the three came out. After another 20 minutes of waiting, the server told us it was late because it \"got behind\" in the oven. REALLY???? Two had no problem coming out but the third got mysteriously behind?

So the service stinks, but that is not the worst part of it, the food is. 

The pizza dough is horrible. It is chewy and flavorless. It must be frozen. If you really like pizza, stay away from this place. It is a sorry excuse for a restaurant that is more concerned about the novelty of its theme than quality pizza."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is such a unique pizza place, due to their well-themed and eclectic decor.  It all looks very \"psychedelic\" and fun.

As far as food, we started with the pesto garlic cheese bread.  The bread came in large portions and would be suitable for 2-6 people or so.  I felt the bread was really nothing special and lacked garlic.  There was plenty of melty ooey gooey cheese, which was delicious, but not much garlic.

For my entree, I ordered a small Mighty Meaty pizza.  The pizza was heavily topped and the crust could barely support it.  It was flavorful and filling.  The crust is coated with parmesan, which was delicious. My only con to this pizza is that I felt like there was a LOT of sauce-- even with all of the toppings, the sauce was a very prominent part of the dish.  It also made for a very messy pizza.  Next time I go back, I think I'll try the garlic and oil pizza base instead of the red sauce.  The pizza is also huge, even for a small.  It comes with four slices.  But each slice is about the size of 2 traditional slices, in my opinion.  I ended up eating two and taking two home.

One other plus worth noting is that they do have several local specialties available at this location only, which is nice.  

One other con worth noting is that you really are better off ordering one of the existing specialty pizzas.  If you build your own, you really are nickel and dimed for every topping-- with some of the toppings like chicken or mozzarella being charged as 2 toppings (since they're a little more premium?)  I debated building my own with bacon, sausage, basil, spinach, garlic, and mozzarella, but the price came out to way more than the Mighty Meaty pizza I ultimately decided on.

The service was great and our server, Sally, was upbeat, positive, and friendly.  It was relatively empty when we first arrived around 5pm on a Sunday, but quickly picked up and got pretty busy by the time we left.

I'll be back for sure-- but will probably try a different sauce or ask them to go \"light\" on the sauce."}
{"text":"The company was great,  service was very good, pizza was just so so.  Bacon Martini yuck.  Fat modules floating in a perfectly nice glass of Belvedere.  I drank it but even writing this now makes me queasy.  Sorry Mellow Mushroom I won't put you on my list of must returns."}
{"text":"In stark contrast to the Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn, this one had unobtrusive background music, and I could hear all the other four people at the table.
The pizza is always top notch here.  Of distinction, my brother-in-law, who ALWAYS finds something to complain about, had NO COMPLAINTS with his calzone.  Congratulations, Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"The pizza is absolutely top notch. Among the best I have tasted. So why only three stars?  Because of the extremely loud sound coming out over the speakers. So loud that carrying on a conversation was laborious. Hard to hear, and hard to be heard. 

Menu offered terrific variety, both in food selection and beer selection. If they would just throttle the sound back by about 50 decibels, this spot would rate 4 1/2."}
{"text":"Worst customer experience I've had. Such a rude waiter and suddenly you can't use a Groupon here if you have multiple checks per table even though we have done this many times at this same restaurant. And when we asked to speak to a a manager they sent a dishwasher out here who pretended to be the manager. I complained to Groupon too. I'll never come back here."}
{"text":"This will always be my favorite spot in the Norterra area. The people who work there are amazing - amber, Jojo, Kara, and Cam stand out specifically but I've always had a great time with everyone there. The food is delicious, beer selection on point, you can't beat the happy hour. I bring all of my out of town guests here and even after all the spots we go to in Scottsdale, downtown, etc, everyone always wants to go to Mellow when they get here! Can't wait to go there for happy hour today! Love this place."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and excellent beer.  If you are a craft beer lover like I am you will be pleasantly surprised, especially during happy hour.  They have at least 30 different craft beers on tap, including about 8 from Rogue.  They have several local brews as well, including Papago's Orange Blossom, and Sonoran's Inebriator.  During happy hour, most of the beers are half off.  You can get a pint for $3 and a 20 oz. for $3.50.  They have specialty pizzas and sandwiches.  There are some appetizers that are a little different than most other places.  The hummus is exquisite.  It's some of the best I have ever had, and during happy hour it's half off as well.  I just started going here maybe about 4 months ago, and I go a couple times a week."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour!  And even Better.... Reverse Happy Hour!  There is a Great selection of beers on tap,  and its constantly changing.  Love the pizza here. I'm not a crust person at all, seriously i hate crust, but this is one place where i do eat my crust.  And a shout out to Bartenders Jenna, Nick and Joe. They are awesome."}
{"text":"I have been to many Mellow Mushrooms on the East coast (Florida, South Carolina, Georgia, etc...) and was so excited to see when they opened their first one in North Phoenix. (Happy Valley location). I have been a regular customer since the grand opening.  

They now have 2 other locations, one in City North and this one off Mill Ave.  I hear a rumor of another....

The happy hour specials for appetizers do not exist at this location, or its only for certain days.  I am not sure.  I guess some days you get pizza slices (on thursday nights) and others you may get the appetizers...I dunno, I will try to confirm if I go back. The beers are still half off and they are always rotating.  That is one of the things I love about Mellow.

I have eaten here a many times during non Happy Hour and it can get pricey.  Unfortunately the food is not always consistent.  I think one day they were running low on mozzarella and thus mixed it with cheddar cheese which greatly altered the taste of the thai dye pizza.  The meat pizza is usually a safe bet, but there was a time when even that was lacking.  There was good and bad days for the wings.

Service is decent.  So far no complaints there.

Ambiance is just not there for me.

I can't say I won't be back, but this is one location I will not be patronizing as much.  Its my least favorite Mellow thus far."}
{"text":"If you like happy hour and beer then this is the place to visit. Open late for drinks and food, it's the perfect place to have a drink with friends and blow off steam from work. Go on Tuesday or Friday to have Cody, the best bartender there and in general, make you a FANTASTIC drink and have it served with a TRUE smile. He will make your visit so memorable you will HAVE to go back!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Had a great server.  We ordered pretzels with cheese(they were good but a little over cooked), buffalo chicken pizza, mighty meaty, and potato skin pizzas.  Now mind you, the boys had eyes bigger than their stomachs.  The crust is on the thicker side, I was content with one slice of the potato pie, which was really good.  We have pizza for the next few meals!  Oh, Oh, Oh, they usually have a groupon, check before you go."}
{"text":"I ordered the holy shiitake pie and funky q chicken.  The shiitake was awesome if you are a mushroom lover, the funky q was good too but was a bit too salty for my taste.

The service was just ok - I had to get their attention many times for additional ranch, utensils, and the check .. Wish they just came and checked on us periodically instead even if they were busy.

They have one of the worse restrooms, it compares similarly to a restroom you will find in a gas station while on a road trip - yuck."}
{"text":"Food is decent, the hoagies are good, pizza is alright.  We were enticed by a $10 gift card in the mail which came in a pair.  Unfortunately the gift card we grabbed was for February instead of January and David the manager wouldn't honor it. Will not be returning as there are better options that provide better service."}
{"text":"Service issues!  We LOVE the pizza but they need to work on the service. We waited a long time for food with a variety of explanations including, \"There's one person making pizzas\" and, \"The kitchen's been slow since Friday\"...and it was a slow Sunday night when we were there. I hope they can get the service taken care of so that we can keep enjoying the good food, but right now it's a frustrating experience!"}
{"text":"Good pizza and you definitely pay for it.  I eat the Mellow all the time at home (Atlanta) and stopped by this location while visiting family in Phoenix.  They lured me in with the Moose Drool on tap - those Big Sky people need to start distributing to the East Coast!  

Anyway, ordered an app of bruschetta, large specialty pie and two beers - the damage? $50! Yeah, that's right folks.  It was worth it but not what I typically spend on pizza and beer. 

We ordered the Magical Mystery Tour pizza.  It has feta, spinach, mushrooms and jalapenos.  Typically we get the jalapenos on the side due to my spice sensitivity but forgot this time around.  My sweet husband picked them off my pieces for me but the spice lingered...but not too bad. I always get a side of pizza sauce with this pizza since it has a basil base and it just seems wrong to eat pizza without some form of tomato sauce!  Anyway, the pie was too large for the two of us to split so of course there were leftovers.  Service was decent. We sat in the bar area to watch the game so service was a little slow just due to the nature of where we sat.  No real complaints - we got everything that we need in a reasonable amount of time.

Really if it were for the Drool I would skip the Phoenix location due to the ridiculous sales tax and eat at home...but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do to get her most favorite beer on tap."}
{"text":"I thought the pizza was very good. I loved my fruity drink. The food came out fast, which is good since we were on our way to a movie. The server was very rushed and obly spent about 5 seconds with us at each interaction. Overall it was a kid experience though."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened at this location. Service is always pretty good. Their 20+ draft beer selection is always awesome! Their pizzas are the best. They are a style of their own. I love their happy hour with half off appetizers and beer. They may have backed off on the beer discount lately :(, but still not bad. My wife loves their wings. 

I recommend their Mighty Meaty or House Special and drink it with a Sculpin IPA."}
{"text":"Ugh...so not worth it. Today we went there to try their gluten free pizza since no one else in Charlotte is serving it. Our server seemed very unknowledgable about it and rudely talked us out of it, saying it was gross and should only be eaten if you have to. Service was slow and she forgot about us for some time, leaving us outside without water for most of our meal. The pizza was greasy and unimpressive. If you want a good pizza thus chain offers nothing you can't get at a mom and pop that actually gives a hoot - especially with premade gluten free crusts that are apparently inedible."}
{"text":"pretzels are so delish and pizza is always great. service is generally good"}
{"text":"I come here often and the service is always exceptional. The happy hour drink prices are unbeatable! Tiana was our server tonight and made our experience that much better."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Mellow Mushroom. Their pizza crust is my favorite part and I have never had a bad pizza from them! They even have a groupon going on right now, so I can't wait to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free crust was underdone and not very tasty. :("}
{"text":"We LOVE this pizza!  The food is consistently good, the atmosphere is fun and the service great.  Try the pretzel appetizer."}
{"text":"Went here recently with a friend.  Was tempted to get a pizza but tried a build your own salad instead. Salad was definitely a good size and had the right lettuce to toppings ratio. Some places skimp on the toppings, but Mellow Mushroom does a nice job of giving you just enough. I enjoyed the roasted red peppers, olives, and onions. They have quite a variety so you could really go crazy with the salad.  I also had the pretzel bites - a little larger than expected! There was enough to share with my friend, but we could've split it four ways as an appetizer.  It comes with a yummy cheese dip - can't complain there!  Next time, I'll definitely try a pizza as it seems to be their main thing.  I see that there are some bad reviews for this place. I thought the restaurant was clean and service was great. Granted it was a weeknight but I'm looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"Went with a big group of med students after they took boards. The staff was accommodating, if a little flaky when dividing up orders but the drink choices were good albeit pricey. The place was loud and busy for just opening up. I just tried the \"House Special\" pizza and it was good. Overall, no complaints to going back."}
{"text":"Very busy place with really good happy hour prices in the whole place. Good selection at good prices with half or full size orders. I had the 3 meatball appetizer, mild wings and Greek salad. All were very good with a friendly efficient server. Downsides are this place is really noisy and was too hot. Need to cool it more before opening perhaps."}
{"text":"Went after a panther's game. It was pretty busy so I wasn't surprised service was pretty bad. My only qualm was that my pizza was burnt, which made the crust so chewy it actually made my jaw sore to eat it!  Not what you expect for a $20 medium pizza"}
{"text":"We had come here when they first opened and weren't very happy. Decided to give them another try--glad we did! Wings are baked instead of fried--tasty and not dried out! Cheesesteak hoagie was full of tender beef, no gristle. Anthony  took great care of us, too! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"If you ever want exceptionally good pizza, don't pass this one up! If you do go, always always always try to request Robbert to be your server. He's a big goof and very well mannered! I say this place is a 10/10! Great job, Mellow"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of pizza.  Very good dough.  Excellent sausage (some of the best I've had).  And all around high quality, fresh toppings and good sauce.

The decor is a little weird, but nice.  Has an old-school movie theater theme, which is great for kids, but seems like a waste of space and money to me.  Very nice indoor / outdoor bar though.

I say, definitely check it out, it's worth a try if you like pizza."}
{"text":"Took an hour and 20 minutes before everyone in our group of 18 got their food.  I do not recommend for large groups.  We made a reservation days before going and they had no idea we were coming and said they only had one cook."}
{"text":"We won't return.  In for lunch, the place deserted and it still took over 30 minutes for our pizza.  How do they handle busy night service?  Soggy crust, just not up to standard when compared to other MM establishments.  Gets points for the apple wood bacon."}
{"text":"Service: Poor. We were getting a pizza to go, so we went to the bar. The bartender didn't seem to be interested in serving us at all. My friend was trying to order a specific pizza without some of the topping and he was just not helpful or receptive. Surprise, surprise, it came back wrong. By the time we got the pizza, it was 10 pm and we were just ready to go. Someone came out and offered to redo the pizza and promised to have it out in 8 minutes, which made us wonder- why couldn't the first one be out in 8 minutes? Whatever. They made it correctly, and in good time. Also, My friend and I went back out while the first pizza was being made so I could go elsewhere, and she got a drink. When we got back to MM, she asked if the drink she ordered could be canceled, and the bartender says \"why, what happened?\" Don't worry about why, just cancel it! 

Food: It looked great, like amazing! She liked it."}
{"text":"This place is getting two stars solely based on the fact that the pizza crust is delicious and buttery. Everything else about our dining experience was less than desirable, bordering on pretty bad. We ordered a simple cheese calzone and a Holy Shiitake mushroom pizza - easy enough. We waited a full 60 minutes for the food to come out, and that was after we had to approach the hostess stand to ask about the status of our food, since our waitress had avoided our table for 25 minutes. Finally, we got our food, and asked for the check immediately because we weren't in the mood to wait for another hour for that. It was then we noticed we were charged for a large pizza when we had ordered a medium. The manager fixed the bill, but was very nonchalant about the whole experience, as was the server. Overall, the food was decent, but for being a mushroom pizza boasting at least 3 kinds of mushrooms, there were hardly any on our pizza. We will never be going back as it was not worth the frustration, or the hour and 45 minutes of our life we will never get back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better rating but the place was crowded, took over an hour to get a seat and then about an hour to get our food (which wasn't that good!) To me the experience was not pleasant. Not in a rush to get back there. Beer menu was good with additional cool beer concoctions like the dirty hippy which is two beers mixed together. Fun atmosphere with a casual feel. Just too many people on Saturday night."}
{"text":"My custom red sauce gluten free vegan pizza & custom greek salad were both on point. They couldn't of been better!! They have a great patio which I definately enjoyed on this beautiful sunny day. Also the service was excellent & the food came out to us very promptly. Impressed by my first visit."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything about my experience at mellow mushroom but found the food to be average overall. The hostess was very knowledgeable about the menu and made recommendations. I had the loaded potato pizza and spinach dip. Both were good, but nothing i would order again. The dough was the best part of the pizza. Other than that, I had fantastic service in a great environment. I would give it another try!"}
{"text":"It was surprisingly a quiet night in down town Tempe and perfect for a pizza at Mellow Mushroom!! The husband and I couldn't decide so instead of our normal rock- paper-scissors, we did a pizza half-and-half. It was great and we both got what we wanted! Don't waste your money on the Caesar salad, unless you want to pay eight bucks for lettuce and croutons?? Instead I would go for there Cobb salad. I wish that's what we would've done. The service was great, the ambience was inviting and the pizza was tasty as always!!!  Grab a groupon to get $20 for $10!! :-))"}
{"text":"Don't sit at the bar during happy hour you will be blind when you leave. It faces west and its open, super poor design. Waited for a small pizza forover 1 hour"}
{"text":"First off we waited 10 mins to be greeted at the counter.! Then it took 45 min to get our to go order when we were quoted 30 min on the phone.  On top of everything our order was wrong.  We then had to wait for them to remake our pizza.  Even though they reimbursed us,  it took 20 min to get my credit card back?!!!  The pizza wasn't even that good!  In a world of competition this place doesn't deserve as much business as it gets.  What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"We ordered a cheese pizza to go. Order took about 40 minutes total which was understandable because they were extremely busy. The hostess kept coming by and saying our order would be ready soon and that they hadn't forgotten about us.  That was fine. However, when we finally got the pizza it was COLD. I am extremely disappointed that we had to wait so long to end up getting a less than fresh product. Also, the pizza was ordered to be lightly baked but unfortunately our request was not honored. The bottom was completely burned. It is not the first time our pizza has had a burned bottom which is why we always make a point of requesting lightly baked to prevent this.  We literally live right next door to the restaurant so we routinely patronize it. I certainly didn't mind the wait but I expected to at least receive a hot and fresh product at the end of it which didn't occur. The staff appears to be very poorly equipped to handle a busy night."}
{"text":"They make really good specialty Pitza, everyone that works here is really friendly! I also think it's nice that they have gluten free Pitza that tastes pretty good for people that have gluten issues.  Environment is really relaxed. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I really like their pizza and it's super filling.  The employees are super nice.  It gets noisy but it's fun."}
{"text":"Really like the pizza. Came here after traveling from so cal to nearby hotel. Pizza was tasty and had a great crust on it. The beer they suggested went perfect with it. Nice pizza place."}
{"text":"Food is good but beer is WAY over priced, $6.5 for a pint when across the street at Mad Dog it is $3 for a 32oz (only til 8 tho). We ordered one beer each, wanted a second but passed. It's not worth 26$ for 4 pints. I hope they change their beer prices fast or we wont be back any time soon."}
{"text":"After reading a lot of the bad reviews my fiance and I were a little skeptical about coming here, but we tried it anyway.  I don't know if the people that gave it bad reviews came at a busier time than we did or what, but the service was great! The waitress was very attentive and checked up on us often. Our pizza (build your own) was out in 15 minutes and was exactly how we ordered it. The pizza was amazing too! Definitely coming here again! Very happy!"}
{"text":"Meh. That is the best way to describe it. I would give it a 5 star for decor and atmosphere but service and food were lacking. We waited for about one hour ( the place wasn't even half full) for our food and it was just okay. For the price, I was expecting bigger portions and better tasting food."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends on their recommendation on a Friday night. We were told there would be a 45 minute wait so we bellied up to the bar and had a drink. 

We were seated in about 15 minutes. I ordered the Hawaiian style pizza..the name escapes me now...it was not good. The meat had the consistency of very fine sloppy joe meat and was smeared in the center of the crust which caused the crust to be nothing but a soggy mess. The rest of the toppings where fairly scarce.  It was also fairly spicy. The outside edge of the crust wasn't bad.

The service was terrible. Most things we had to ask for two or three times. Each time she came back and we asked again she said she forgot. 

To be fair here the others said the pizzas they ordered were good.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is always fantastic! So many choices & have never been disappointed. Hubby's1st time, and he said he'll definitely be back soon! Always a plus when your dining experience is above par: our waiter was awesome & the GM also came by to check on our food & service. Very friendly, professional & knowledgeable staff! Make sure to have the pretzels & cheese sauce...sooooo good! And, ask your server for craft beer recommendations; nice pairings for any taste!"}
{"text":"Craving Mellow Mushroom? Me too, sometimes. Next time you are considering getting a Mellow Mushroom pizza head to the Selwyn Location. I've ordered carry out from the Uptown location and it was far less tasty than Selwyn. Last night I tried to dine in and the draft system was down, service was terrible and I left after feeling abandoned by a very disinterested server. Mellow, I love you. Please fix this location."}
{"text":"This is probably the raddest Mellow Mushroom I have ever been to.  Bf and I came here for some late-night food after a wedding. 

We sat at the bar, had (somewhat warm) PBR and bruschetta appetizer while we watched some baseball on their flat screen TVs and waited for our pizza to-go.  That bruschetta came out really fast, and it was fresh and full of flavor.

The bartender was so nice that he gave me a Halloween decoration I admired after bf asked him where we could get one (look for the frankenstein lantern in the picture I uploaded)! The pizza we ate back at our hotel was buffalo chicken, caramelized onions and ranch, and it was delicious! We were going to get a medium, but it was going to cost us $20 as opposed to the $13 small. Twenty bucks is a little pricey I say, but we probably wouldn't have eaten more than the small anyways, so it worked out."}
{"text":"My wife and I first experienced the Mellow Mushroom pizza bakers in North Carolina, and were a little reluctant to visit their new operation in North Phoenix, however were pleasantly surprised with how consistently good their pizza pie is!

The atmosphere at this Mellow Mushroom leaves a little to be desired, with unimaginative decor and no unique feel to it, unlike both establishments we visited in NC, which were crazy localized.  

The severs we had at this MM were both knowledgeable of the menu and of their excellent craft beer selection.  They feature beer from Sonoran and Papago, which are local brewers, as well as Rogue, and a few others from the left coast.  They claim to have an excellent selection of local, craft brew, which I agree that they have a better selection than most, but where are the Nimbus, Oak Creek and Beaver St beer?  Include the state of Arizona in your draft beer selection, I won't be disappointed.

Enough about appetizers, onto the pizza!  They have a great selection of toppings and some pretty creative specialty pizzas that are sure to please anybody who loves something different.  We frequently get the magical mystery tour and are never left hungry.  They dough is a little thick for my tastes, however, they sprinkle a little graded parmesan on the crust, making the entire slice devourable.

Mellow Mushroom is definitely a chain restaurant, however they stand far above the other chain pizza restaurants in the valley, and they are definitely worth trying.  Believe you me, you will become hooked, and this place will be your primary pizza destination!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good and unique, and if you like doughy crust you'll be happy. Plenty of options for veggie heads and meat eaters alike.

Great tap list, I just wish someone would come over and offer to get me another beer. Really poor service up to this point, probably won't be back. There is another one at Norterra, if you really care that much."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mellow Mushroom locations! The service is always really good (as soon as we finished a beer the waitresses would be there to ask if we needed anything else), and it's never crazy busy so you can usually get a good spot at the bar or somewhere at a table with a good view of the TVs. 

A lot of times I just drink here, because they have such a great beer menu (lots of cool IPAs to choose from and they're new every time I go), but last time we got the Great White pizza and mild/jerk wings. All of it was delicious! Definitely going to continue coming here on football Sundays. We also got the free salad for checking in!"}
{"text":"Came here and the service was crappy, the waitress that served us seemed like she hated her job! Very slow service a fly  came out from our pizza toppings and the pizza taste like sweat! Sweet tea way too sweet, me and my family will never go there again it physically made us all sick and my husband threw up!"}
{"text":"Food & service is amazing. We had a party of 8 & we didnt even need to wait. I ordered half Thai Dye(which was the best PIZZA ive ever had in my whole life) & half Maui Wowie. We also had Pretzel & Spinach dip w/ pita & they were good as well. The restaurant itself is vegetarian friendly too which is fantabulous."}
{"text":"Both times I have eaten here it has taken forever for the food to come out! And everyone I know says it always takes a very long time for their food to come out as well (yes, even for to-go). It's pretty ridiculous. The menu looks good but the food is just ok and the pizza doesn't have a very good crust. The first time I ate here I ordered the pretzel balls with cheese and the entire dish REEKED of bananas?! It was quite disgusting. Come here if you like waiting a very long time after you order to eat."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, and fun chill vibe. Servers are always nice, and the food is always good. I recommend getting the pretzels and wings."}
{"text":"A friend raved about their food so we made the 30+ minute drive. We often drive 30 minutes when we like restaurant.  In the future we will drive over to Oregano's or Grimaldi's. Oregano's being our first choice. 
For Mellow Mushroom maybe it is their \"company approach\" but the staff could use some grooming and extensive customer service training. Based on our experience and other patron observation. Our server may have said a total of 12 words. We placed our drink and appetizer order and said we hadn't decided on our pizza. The server brought our drinks and walked away. The server walked back to our table and stood there. We assumed for our pizza order. Plates were \"dropped off\" with a tap on the table with every pass. The Pizza was brought out.  A quick pulse check and occasional drink refill. 
No appetizers were brought and after paying our check the server vanished. 
We could say a lot more about this visit but don't want to put forth the effort as that seems to be the Mellow Mushroom way. 
To management, we have seen other replies - if you want to make this \"right\". Donate to a charity we won't make the drive."}
{"text":"We were next door at Romare Bearden Park and decided to get some takeout we could eat in the night air while enjoying a jazz band. With the concert and a baseball game going on, we expected a long wait. 

Before we ordered, we were told it would be an hour to get anything for takeout - which was ok due to our expectations. 

I ordered the Magical Mystery Tour which has Pesto base with button and Portobello mushrooms, feta and mozzarella cheeses, spinach and jalape√±os on a pesto basted crust. A medium was about $20. I asked for jalape√±os on half. When we picked it up, about an hour later, they were helpful with napkins, plates and anything else we needed. 

Verdict - great flavor, and an abundance of toppings - on half. The half with jalape√±os was loaded up. The other half looked naked. Flavor was fantastic, but was extremely disappointed that for $20, they couldn't get both halves to look the same. The no jala side had maybe two mushrooms - and no spinach. If it had been even, I'd have said it was worth the price."}
{"text":"I enjoy the pizza at Mellow Mushroom but find that oftentimes they're too busy or understaffed to give customers enough attention. J. and I had dinner here and waited 15 minutes before being able to place our order (drinks + food). We had to wait about half an hour after that for our pizza to arrive. Once our server brought our food out to us, we didn't see her again until we had to wave her down for our check. 

The restaurant itself has a fun atmosphere, food and drinks are delicious, and it's a great place to bring a group. It can be a little loud at times, but I don't think that's a big deal."}
{"text":"When we arrived last Friday, we noticed half of the tables were empty and still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated...the older head hostess did not seem to care to much about what she was doing.  Our waitress was so quiet I couldn't hear her.  She seemed very over whelmed.  We oder some beers an app and pizza. Our beers took a while to come out along with the pizza.  The waitress said our pizza order was behind a larger table's order (which I understand I've waited many tables) all I wanted my was second beer.  That one took forever, mainly because our waitress was waiting the kitchen on the food to come out. Once we got our pizza, the great white, which we've had at probably 10 different mellow mushroom all over the country.  This was had so much crust!! Don't get me wrong I love crust but damn it was a lot.  I wanted more toppings!!  I wish I could give a 1/2 star 2.5 stars would be my rating.  

Side note the table next to use had to ask 3 different employees for silver and napkins.  I gave her my silver since it was still wrapped up and we had gotten our food yet."}
{"text":"All I can say is wowza! This was my first time here an won't be my last.....beer list is awsome...they have Founders Breakfast Stout!  We ordered 2 small pizzas The Red Potato Pie and the Magic Mystery.  Our waiter was awsome (Christian)with making suggestions. We also made it just in time  for happy hour!"}
{"text":"10 inch pizza, 10 wings, kids meal, one beer and soft drink 50 dollars wasn't worth it for me. pizza was good but not 50 dollars worth."}
{"text":"Well I had pizza from this establishment the other day at my job. The nice people from Peak Data ordered pizza for everyone.....and I must say it was simply delicious. They ordered several different kinds....but my favorite was the veggie.....and the cheese pizzas. I mean the toppings were over the top....which is great.....and the Wheat crust....that's right a wheat crust....was simply delightful. I am going again tomorrow night to try the buffalo chicken.....or maybe the pesto chicken....or maybe the all mushroom pizza....LOL....haven't decided yet. However when I do I will update this review and give you the 411 on whichever one....two...or maybe even 3 pizzas i try. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Doubt we'll be back. We had eight people in our party and they only managed to deliver seven of the meals. It literally took 20 minutes to get the missing order to the table. We asked for a manager and it took 10 mins for him to show up. My portobello & cheese hoagie had baby mushrooms instead of the real deal. My wife's steak salad had very bland and limp steak. The happy hour beer prices are the same as regular price ($5.50 a pint for craft brew) so ... Yeah. There are definitely better options out there."}
{"text":"Came in here on a Wednesday night around 12:20am. We had just arrived in Arizona from the airport. The only open section was the bar area. Almost all the seats at the bar counter were full and there were a few open spaces available at the tables. Our group came in (4 of us) and I saw one of the bartenders who had trays in hand, I said \"excuse me, is this the only area where we could sit?\" He glared at me and looked annoyed and just nodded. We proceeded to sit down at an empty table near the kitchen area.  We waited for someone to approach us and ask us or inform us how to order. We kept on looking at the direction of the bartender that was now at the bar but we weren't entertained. A few minutes later, one other guy with gray hair and glasses just passed by us even after one of us said \"excuse me\" and he went to the table next to us to take their empty plates. He also went to other tables on the other side talking to them and taking out their plates too. We sat there for about 15 minutes without even being acknowledged. We stood up and left. I've never experienced such blatant racism on top of such terrible service."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Mellow, so here is the deal I would recommend not eating here unless you called a to go in, or you sat at the bar and did not mind amateur service and long waits.  35 minutes to get our pizza and there are only 3 other tables in the restaurant.  Service is amateur, but nice, very slow.  Pizza, well it can't be beat, but the toppings were very light.  This place has bad management written all over it.  It's a shame.  Next time I will call in a pick up.
However the kitchens manager came out after the bill was dropped and apologized.  At least someone there is customer oriented.  He was able to turn it around.  Someone should promote him to GM"}
{"text":"I've been to mellow mushroom many times since it's been opened. They have unique pizzas, good beer selection and always busy on the weekends. 
I just went last night since I recently went vegan due to health issues and heard they have vegan options. I thought I paid a lot already for a normal pizza but my goodness I paid way too much for 2 small pizzas and 2 beers. 
I ordered vegan cheese, red sauce, caramelized onions and tempeh. It wasn't bad. Sauce was non existent though and they forgot the tempeh so I pretty much had a vegan cheese and onion pizza with the world's thinnest layer of sauce. Charged me for the tempeh which the waitress took off but even after that, my bill was $47 before tip! Seriously? I'll start making my own vegan pizzas and remember to add tempeh. 
Oh btw, they charge premium for vegan options so remember that! I have purchased all those vegan ingredients at home separately and I don't understand how they can charge so much more. Needless to say, I'll save my $50+ for 2 pizzas and 2 beers and cook it at home."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Ignored by two bartenders, finally the one that was actually working came by to help.  When we asked why the other two bartenders couldn't help, we learned one was a bartender and the other the manager!   Wow.  Good luck staying open with service like that."}
{"text":"Oh boy where do I begin.

First off, my Mom and I accidently entered through the bar, which got me really excited because there is a TON of beers on draft. Being a beer LOVER my mouth started watering in anticipation of having a nice tall glass. Once we finally made it up to the front, found our party, and were seated; I opened the menu only to find to my disappointment that draft beers are $6 a pint!!! REDICULOUS! My mother seems to think I've been stuck in Tempe and Phoenix for too long but I just think $6 for a beer, is INSANE! ...so I decided to protest by getting a Root beer.

I have to say, I'm not the biggest fan of pizza in the first place, so I come in a little bias. But, my cousin Zach, who was with me, LOVES pizza. I had combed over the menu and mostly out of pure inability to make a decision (extreme lack of sleep and beer after a long day of work and a movie), decided to just go in on the pizza with everyone. Nothing else on the menu seemed to appetizing and there wasn't a whole lot of people eating there either; so there was little visual or smell stimulations. We ordered the white pizza, the hot potato (which scared me, too many starches), and the Hawaiian. The white was boring, as well as the Hawaiian and both had been battered with way too much olive oil before hitting the oven. The Hot potato, which I actually thought would be disgusting, was actually not so bad...with a little Tabasco. And because we had only seen our waiter when we got our drinks, made our order, got the pizza, and paid the bill- I had to go get the Tabasco from the waiters station myself. 

Finally it seems I am about to get home and sleep in a pizza (soon to be heartburn) coma, as we're getting the check but it took our waiter (for some reason) about 15 minutes to process it. There are other people in the mellow mushroom but none in our general vicinity. As we're waiting I'm watching the cooks in the back (they have an open kitchen-which is a cool idea); once, twice, three times I see 3 different cooks wipe their runny ass nose down their fore-arms, just stopping before it hits their hand or glove. YIKES! Next I see a bag of store-bought pitas sitting on the counter; which makes me happy I didn't get the humus. Lastly, as our waiter finally comes out with the check, the door to the kitchen swings open to reveal what appears to be two of the wait staff publically displaying their love.

Perhaps if I was a teen looking to impress some just 21's or guys who like teens, I'd hang out there. Perhaps if I had a ton of cash and didn't care how I wasted it, I'd hang out there. Perhaps, if I (for some God-forsaken reason) lived in the north valley in my pre-20's I think it was cool to hang out at a place where my fellow Gauchos (GCC) worked. But I'm not and I don't. Trust me, I LOVE me some mushrooms and I consider myself somewhat mellow, but Mellow Mushroom does not have it goin on."}
{"text":"Most amazing mushroom soup and pretzel and beer cheese dip. Only complaint was that the outside patio area was not protected from all of the birds was a little scary with all the pigions sitting overhead."}
{"text":"First time with family today. Ambience is really cool & food is terrific! Service is great & everyone is really friendly & attentive! We had shiitake pizza & chicken wings! Its so good! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on Friday night after some shopping and wow it was busy! I have been to different mellow mushroom locations before but this was my first time at this location.
I love that they have plenty of vegetarian options and good sized portions as well. They also list calories on the menu which is helpful but also stressful haha. 
My BF and I were really craving pretzel bites and cheese so we started off with that. It took them like forever to get them to us but they explained it was given to the wrong table. The bites taste nothing like pretzels but they are good, I think we were expecting actual pretzel bites with salt. The cheese sauce was amazing. We also ordered a veggie calzone to share. Good thing we shared cause it was massive. We both thought too much dough not enough filling, but agreed that it tasted very good. Was a little expensive and we didn't like having to wait so long but otherwise good!"}
{"text":"After being open several months, and making many trips back there, I still think they are fun, cool, and the food is great pizza and appetizers.  The part that is lacking is the service still.  When you walk in, busy or not, there is always an air of confusion...nobody seems to know what is going on or where to seat you.  Once you get seated, you wait, and wait, and wait, until someone walking by has to ask if you have been helped yet.  Once you tell them no, a few minutes later someone will come by.  It is like this every single time I visit.  At first I thought it was because they were new. Then I thought it was because it was during a busy time. The last 4 times I went, they were not busy in the least, and they had been open quite a while, so I am not sure why the service is always so bad.  The time before last we ordered a pepperoni pizza, and they brought a half pepperoni and half bacon and pineapple??  Well, the food is still good, but is it enough to keep me coming back?  Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here with my hubby. We had the pizza with pesto, cheese, spinach, mushrooms and jalape√±os. It was delish!!! 
I loved the decor. It was super clean. And I absolutely loved how all the staff were allowed to be themselves: tattoos, piercings, unique hairstyles and colors. I LOVE that!"}
{"text":"Any Bar/Restauraunt that closes at 2am with a kitchen that closes at 1am should always deserve a closer look. Crazy drink specials throughout the nite (3 to 6 pm and 10 to close) which entails HALF off everything, The Mellow Mushroom has much to offer. The food consits of mostly Pizza, calzones, and hoagie's. And as for the drinks, its a full bar. Enthusiastic bartenders, a pelethora of flat screens, trivia books, and of course alcohol will keep you entertained throughout your stay. As for the food, the House Calzone is a good size at an average at most price but, none the less cheezy and pretty good. I cannot comment on the pizza due to this is my first visit. Altogether I enjoyed my visit and look foward to more...."}
{"text":"Fortunately, we had a much better time at this Mellow Mushroom than a lot of other reviewers. Maybe they've finally got their act together? Maybe they had their best employees working, since it was a Friday night? Who knows. 

Anyways, this place was packed, so there was a wait, but we managed to snag a few seats at the bar while we waited on a table. The bartender was attentive and even made conversation with us, despite the fact that he was quite busy. It seemed like he was giving everyone that same level of attention, which is pretty impressive. 

Once a table opened up, we were seated, and our waitress immediately took our orders. The pizza took a little while to arrive, as is the Mellow way, but once it showed up, it was piping hot and delicious.

So, all-in-all, we had a good night. The service and food were at least comparable to the (smaller) Selwyn location. I wouldn't recommend the Mellow Mushroom for a romantic date night or for when you need to be in and out quickly, but if you just want to hang out, you can do so very well here.

PS And yes, people, it's expensive, but no more expensive than any other MM. The pizza's better than take out... you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"FYI: this place delivers to the JW Marriott at Desert Ridge.  

I haven't heard a lot of great things about this place and when I saw the reviews I was skeptical about ordering a pizza from here but after a long day in the lazy river, we wanted pizza so I threw caution in the wind and I'm glad I did.

The delivery was quick, even though it was a busy Friday night.  We ordered a cheese and a Hawaiian - both were absolutely delicious.  My dad even hopped over to our room after his fancy meal at the hotel restaurant and enjoyed a slice.  He pointed out that this pizza is made on a hearth, I can't think of how that's possible but I had fun trying to visualize it in my semi sober state of mind.  I'd like to visit the place and see it for myself sometime."}
{"text":"Updating my review to three stars because their reuben pizza is pretty freaking tasty! Also, staff was friendly and my order was ready on time. I was hating on Mellow Mushroom for a while there, but I think I might have to check out more of their pizza offerings now!"}
{"text":"2nd review: I had to come back and change my initial review from 4 stars to 2 after our take out debacle last week. Long story short my order was not entered or sent to the kitchen when I called so it wasn't ready when I arrived. I had to wait for the order to be made, once we got it home it was not good. It didn't seem like they let the pizza cook long enough, the dough was gummy/soggy. Some of the ingredients were lacking, etc. To top it off the manager , who made the mistake of not sending in my order, didn't comp anything, give us a free dessert or even offer me a beverage while I waited on the order that should have been ready when I walked in. I have worked in the restaurant industry for years and I know how to take care of the customers when something goes wrong and they failed here on that front. 

1st Review:We dined here for lunch and it was the second time I had it. The first time was at a birthday party and it was takeout, so this was the first time I had it fresh out of the oven.. so to speak. We had half BBQ Chicken and half Red potato.. both were delicious! My husband said, \"best crust I have ever had!\" and he also said that it was his \"new favorite pizza\". I agree.. it was super yum! The only small issue I had with the pizza was the chicken on the BBQ pizza tasted stale (if you will)... not rotten or even bad... but it just tasted not fresh. Now... when I got bites of the BBQ pizza with chicken, BBQ sauce, cheese, etc... I could not tell the chicken tasted weird. Overall... we were very pleased and will be back often."}
{"text":"Great rotating taps, and good pricing for happy hour.  The wings and bruschetta are the best options for food.  Staff has changed up a bit in the past year and not as personable as before.  A great spot in City North!"}
{"text":"I really do like their pizza here. The only complaint I've had before is the waiting time; and today we wanted to order in advance, so we didn't have to wait for 40 minutes again. However we were rejected, even though they do takeouts, they couldn't start making the food in advance. The woman on the phone didn't care to help out and \"went to her manager\" to come back with a no. She just sounded like she didn't want to bother, but you can afford to have customers take up a table for no reason for a very long time. Bad service just made the pizza seem not worth it so meh. Go if you have patience I suppose - it's still good food."}
{"text":"Great at first, then the bartender ignored me and my friends for a good 20-30 minutes, We had to flag someone down for napkins and plates and it took a few tries for a water, you shouldn't have to ask someone other then the bartender for something when you are sitting at the bar. I opened a tab for myself and the bartender put every ones drinks on my tab and ignored the problem and made us wait another 15 for them just to ask us who had what. At one point four employees were behind the bar and we had to wait that long (I checked the time). And to make matters worse my friend got a parking ticket because they took so long. No sorry from any of them and not even a drip of regret from the manager. He pretty much told us to chill out after this whole 45 min waiting game when all we were trying to do was pay our bills and leave."}
{"text":"Went to this location for the game the other day. Plenty of craft beers to choose from. Pizzas are delicious and I've been back to the his location many times because of that. Wings are super good as well. I only gabve 5 stars recently because they just cut their menu in half, and unfortunately are missing a couple items I used to really like. Staff has always been pleasant and never took long to get any of my dinners out."}
{"text":"First time today a co-worker and I decided to give this place a try. I am very glad we did, it is probably one of the best specialty pizzas I have had in a long time. The Feta cheese was so good, the spinach still tasted like spinach and wasnt over cooked. the mushrooms were huge and delicious not little mushroom flakes like you get on other pizzas. The only reason I didn't give it a 5star is because of the crust. It was good, but it was a little to flimsy for me. I don't mind a thin crust I just like it a little crispy if it is thin, when it is not it gives the feeling it is \"soggy\" but it wasn't. Certainly give this place a try."}
{"text":"The people are nice, the pizza is only OK from the previous visits, but the place is just too loud.  The host tried to seat myself and my family members and I could not hear what the heck he was saying and he was within 3 feet.  We just left."}
{"text":"We typically rave about the pizzas but had a sub par experience. The magical mystery tour pizza was requested with no jalape√±os but was still made that way. The server picked them off but it tasted like jalape√±os and was not good. The Holy shiitake was very heavy on the aioli. We expect excellence when you pay $25 for a pizza but were unfortunately reminded why we go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love the local beers, pretzels and Thai Dye pizza! Can get noisy in there so request to sit outside on a nice night. They will make a pizza half and half for you so you can try the different types. They also offer vegan alternatives which is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Nitemare. Never been a huge fan of the franchise but most could execute the basics. Not this one. Rafts of staff wondering around aimlessly, lotsa phone chat and grab ass, poor training. Some folks seemed to care, but most thought they were at Dominos. If all they want to do is takeout they should shutter the dining room and move on."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a basic pizza, this is not the place to go. They have an excellent crust, and they have gluten free options and also tofu \"meat\" toppings if you so desire. They also have different sauces (white, pesto, traditional) and different toppings (artichoke hearts, Portobello mushrooms, etc.)  The calzones are great also, and big enough to feed two.

TIP: Order one of the \"named\" pizzas on the menu if you can find one that suits you. If you build your own custom pizza or calzone you may get a bit of sticker shock when they bring the bill."}
{"text":"Went here for a date, great environment, great food, good service. Will return someday."}
{"text":"We tried this location using a Groupon last week.  It was a weeknight,  and not very busy.  Our server was nice.  We shared a house salad which was just \"okay\". It was missing the cheese it said it had on the menu.  We ordered a large pizza with the works.  I forget what it's called, but it had several meats and veggies.   It was delicious.  I loved the crispness of the crust.  We will definitely be back to try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is soooo good
Was visiting Arizona and headed to this lovely restaurant everything we ordered was so fresh and yummy
Greek salad .... Delicious
Wings....Delicious 
Pizza.... Freshhhhhhh and just so good!

No complaints I was so full I wanted to eat more 
Wish we had one in California
I want to go back to AZ just to eat here again"}
{"text":"I rather thought this Mellow Mushroom was fun.  A classic cinema theme pizza and beer joint!  

We started off ordering the Stuffed Portabello Mushroom; stuffed artichoke hearts, feta cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and mozzarella.  It was drizzled with some balsamic oil and is plated on a bed of lettuce.  If you're a mushroom fan then this quick bite is for you!  The texture is not my cup of tea; I wanted some crunch and brittleness!  However, the flavor was decent with the balsamic providing a sweet bite along with the salad.  For our pizza, we did mushrooms again; right!?  We tried the Holy Shiitake Pie which included shiitake, portabello, and button mushrooms; along a mix of caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese.  Drizzled with a garlic aioli and some truffle oil; this pizza had some aromatic punch!  Granted, I'm a meat lovers kind of guy and this pizza didn't really do it for me.  The crust was thick and doughy so that was a plus for us carb-loaders!

Overall, Mellow Mushroom is a good pizza joint with some fun and interesting ingredients. 
Though I thought the price point is tad bit on the pricier side for what you get; One stuffed portabell for $11.99!.  The service overall is solid and the atmosphere is fun! - Enjoy"}
{"text":"It's a pretty chill atmosphere...great beer selections. However go when its happy hour.  Drunks and appetizers are half off.  Also. Try the white pizza..its delish"}
{"text":"Don't bother. This place used to be a great location to come to for lunch. Over the last year, they have become slower and slower. It took over a half an hour to get a small pizza, a sandwich and some pretzels. We came after the lunch rush and the place was empty. The waiter would disappear for long periods off time and was very inattentive. No excuse when they were not busy."}
{"text":"We've tried Mellow Mushroom a couple of times now hoping the food and service is better than our prior visits because we love how this place feels and their location.  They are conveniently located in front of one of the best movie theaters in northern Phoenix, Harkins at Norterra.  Oddly enough this Mellow Mushroom doesn't offer the \"Dinner & Movie\" promotion other MM's offer from their web site.  In fact we found very few promotions this location is offering compared to other MM's according to their web site.

Again this place has a really cool vibe with some neat decor through out the restaurant. They have both indoor and out door seating and their bar has some TV's to catch a game while eating.  They have an awesome beer selection which is probably their best feature with out a doubt and probably the reason I keep coming back.

Their pizza ~ they have a good variety of topping to choose from but you either like their crust or you don't. We unfortunately don't like it because it's more like bread and not crust.  It's too chewy and you have to eat it with a fork. We loved the toppings and beer. Our server could not remember our drinks and we had to ask someone else to get our bill... 

I tried their Mushroom Club on my last visit with chips and an iced tea. The fresh sprouts on top were more yellow and brown and not green at all. My server stated \"we got a fresh shipment in today\" and then walked off. After scrapping them off because they did not taste good I found my sandwich very cold in the center compared to the rest of the sandwich which was average temp for a club. So I ate around the center. My chips looked like they were scooped from the bottom of the bag if you know what I mean.  These were chips of chips... I had track down my server since she was more interest in carrying on conversations with the other, very young, servers hanging out around their desk in the middle of the restaurant. I showed her my \"chips of chips\" and she stated \"that's how our chips are. Many people complain about them and I don't know why we serve them\" and then off she went again... I asked another passing server to see a manager hoping to give them some good feedback concerning my experience but they never came by my table. 

I found the best time to go to MM is during their happy hour just before catching a movie when you can get half priced beer and apps. For if they did not have this promo I would probably never go back to this MM.  Because of this promo and their awesome beer selection I am giving them an A~OK rating."}
{"text":"This is my fourth Mellow Mushroom location (previously eaten at their Birmingham, Tuscaloosa and Fort Worth locations), and this is probably the weakest of the bunch. Allow me to explain:

The pizza, while truly delicious, is a wee bit skimpy on the toppings. The crust, however, is good enough that this is not a fatal weakness. But it should be remedied. All of the other locations I have visited are more generous in this regard.

We had the Holy Shiitake, a cheese pizza with pepperoni and sausage, and a Kosmic Karma. The best, I terms of toppings volume was the cheese, followed by the Karma and sadly by my favorite, the Shiitake. The last pizza is generally stellar, but in Scottsdale it was just good.

Now to the service: Mellow Mushroom prides itself on hiring interesting and cool people. Piercing and tats are frequent, as is a very casual demeanor. I appreciate the approach, but I would like to see a couple of changes, such as being more attentive and writing down orders. Pro tip: writing the order means you don't forget the artichoke hearts my friend wanted on her Kosmic Karma.

The beer selection is bewildering and the type on the beer menu is tiny, and covers both sides of a sheet of letter paper, so bring your reading glasses if you're old like me.

I believe 3.5 stars would be a better rating, but they get 4 because of the awesome flavor of their pizzas."}
{"text":"I've visited four Mellow Mushroom locations, and I can say this one is by far the worst. The decor is great, but that's where the goodness ends. The pizza is average. Well, it depends if it's burnt or not. On 2 separate occasions, our takeout was burnt. Just burnt. Other times, there's random ingredients on the pizza that have spilled over from other pizzas. I don't want random string things on my cheese pizza. I'd rather go to the one on Selwyn even though it's farther from my house. I woudn't reccomend this particular Mellow Mushroom--head to the other Charlotte location instead."}
{"text":"The service was good but the pizza, was flavorless.  Shouldn't go to a non Italian pizza place!"}
{"text":"I thought it was better than your average pizza place,  and I dig the whole hippie/magic mushroom theme of the place. I have to hand it to our server for being patient with us, as we had the kids with us and they were in full naughty mode. 
Price-wise, there's better bang for your buck, but kids drinks are free, and that Mellowterranean pizza was worth trying. I'd definitely pay the Mellow Mushroom another visit, next time without the kiddos."}
{"text":"Gross!
I ordered one of my favorite sandwiches, the Tofu:) and my husband ordered the Italian.   They were not good to the point of being awful.
This is such a disappointment because we have always looked for Mellow Mushroom...Charlotte, Clemson...because we love their food.  Yuck.  Can't wait to brush my teeth."}
{"text":"Went here around 3p to watch some NFL games before walking over to the stadium to watch the Steelers vs Panthers. The food was fine, it was the service however was not that great. It took me literally 25 minutes to get an appetizer of cheesy garlic bread. A small pizza took about 35 minutes. When it came to getting any beer refills most of the bartenders did not notice or acknowledge if I wanted anything else. Not much more to tell, but was not thrilled over the service at all."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time last night. It was around midnight on a Friday so one could question the quality as its late and a busy night...

 I picked up the pizza to take home for a movie/food binge night with my girlfriend, we got the Funky Q Chicken. It was $26 for a large pizza! I was a little surprised at how expensive it was but we still decided to go pick it up. The staff was nice and the pizza was ready right when we got there.

 The pizza was AMAZING! usually its the toppings that stand out, well not only were the toppings delicious but the crust was incredible! SO DAMN GOOD! I wolfed down 3 slices with the quickness. overall great pizza and I look forward to eating the leftovers. 

Overall great pizza and experience, only con was how expensive it was. Check it out!"}
{"text":"4 stars for the beer selection. 1 star for the pizza. Service is decent. The two times I have had their pizza I was really disappointed. The crust was thick and doughy and tasted like cardboard. Very bland toppings. Good thing they had some great beers to wash it down with."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mellow Mushroom!  Yes it is a chain, but come on give it a chance.  I promise it's worth it!  The pies are both creative and delicious.  It is California Style with a cheesy chewy crust.  I love the Caesar salad pizza, the Yukon gold potato, and the Maui wowie.  I also love their pretzels made with the chewy yummy dough I mentioned earlier.  
Then there is the beer selection.  They have a huge variety of local beers.  My recommendation is the Popago orange blossom.  It is both creamy and orangey goodness.  This place is a must stop on Mill!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming here.  They have this fun and easy going atmosphere where you can relax, have wonderful service and terrific food.  We've ordered Pacific Rim pizza, the combination of pineapple and jalapenos is terrific. Wings are super tasty as well, tried the Thai sauce and refusing to try any other flavors now. If you want a chill place, where you can relax, have a drink and friendly service, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I recently visited Mellow Mushroom out in Deer Valley for the first time. I was pleasantly surprised with how great their pizza was! Very cool location in the little outdoor mall area that have created on Happy Valley Road. The wait staff was awesome and very helpful with getting us seated right away. We tried the pretzel bites and bbq wings as appetizers. The were both delicious. The wings had great flavor. The pretzel bites had a nice cheese on the side that was really great. We then also ordered the Meaty pizza. It was topped with bacon, ham, sausage, pepperoni and a few other types of meats. I loved the thicker crust! It was a really great pizza for our first time visiting. We also used a groupon deal too. Very easy to use and the waiter made the adjustments to our bill very quickly. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place but the pizza is just so burnt now. This happened both times we went there at dinner time frames. The first time we went in the afternoon it was fine and very good, but the past two times we went at dinner time it was horrible. The pizza crust just tasted so dry and burnt. The meatballs and wings tasted better. I am not sure if they have a new way of cooking or if there's a new employee learning but the pizza is not good anymore. Not sure what is going on but I hope they can fix this issue. We order the mighty meaty. I hope they can fix the issue soon because we don't want to lose another place near home to eat at. The staff are pretty nice though. Kinda pricey."}
{"text":"Mellow mushroom is a cool place.  Prices were decent and the food met expectations.  Great kids meals and an extensive beer selection.  The bad... service left something to be desired.  Loaded with students, as one would expect, so there were big tables that must have been hard to stay on top of.  I like the creative menu options and overall vibe.  With kids, I would go back.  Without, depends on the situation..."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed at all. For the food, I had a calzone for $14 bucks and far from how a real calzone should taste. They gave me 2 ounces of pizza sauce for this huge calzone. Atmosphere is good,tvs are decent. But,that's where the line in the sand is drawn. Place is always empty. It's like huge inside,like a Walmart, first tell tale sign. Usually the whole in the wall pizza joints are best. So your paying there rent,not getting excellent food."}
{"text":"Groovy dude... A kitschy, franchise pizzeria that makes totally funkadelic (and awesome) pizzas with a great beer selection. We've been Mellow fans since living in Denver and we were psyched to see that there was a Mellow on Selwyn. The portabella mushroom appetizer is awesome and could totally be an entree. It's a large portabella mushroom cap baked with artichokes, feta and sundried tomatoes served on top of spring greens with a balsamic reduction. Our favorite pizza is the Maui Wowie pizza. This pizza is loaded with toppings. I highly recommend subbing the banana peppers for candied jalapenos. Those candied jalapenos up the spice level and compliment the pizza really well. The pizzas seem pricey but when you see what comes out you'll see it's money well spent. I love their crust. Perfect texture, slightly sweet taste... Brushed with butter and sprinkled with parm. Divine.

Helpful Tips:
- Parking is never a problem. If the top deck is full, head down to the garage.
- Service has always been good at this location.
- They can easily accommodate large groups. 
- They have TVs in the bar that are always tuned to sports. 
- If you frequent the Mellow, make sure you join the Beer Club. 
- This location offers GFree, vegan crusts"}
{"text":"I only had the cheesy bread and a glass of wine, but our waitress, Kyla, was so phenomenal that I had to write a review. I was visiting from out of town with a group of friends and we went to this restaurant for their gluten free pizza and affordable drinks. I was really sick with allergies, and Kyla was extremely sympathetic and brought me hot water with lemon and honey. She refilled it every 30 seconds that I chugged it. I honestly don't think I've ever had better customer service. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes based on my experience going to the one at City North. 2nd visit to this location, thinking they might redeem themselves. This time with a Groupon in tote.

Nope - no redemption. I ordered takeout - 2 hoagies (both no cheese, no mayo). The girl taking the order repeats this - no cheese, no mayo. I arrive and the order comes out - both have cheese. Apologies all around. Someone even comes out from the kitchen to apologize and to say my order is now priority. He also reconfirms - no cheese, no mayo. 20 minutes later the order comes back out. The bar tender and I both take a quick inspection - yep, no cheese!

Didn't think to recheck the mayo. Get home - both sandwiches have mayo. Luckily the mayo is only on one side of the bread, so we can salvage at least part of our lunch. Sadly disappointed. Two visits, both times my order has come out incorrectly. This time, both attempts at the same order still not right :("}
{"text":"Not the Greek Salad I am used to from Mellow Mushroom. Stingy on olives and other veggies. I ordered a full salad and only received one container of dressing. Parking is the pits."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. Was a little disappointed when I looked online and found out it was a chain. The atmosphere was fun, a lot of people, but I wish the music was a little lower. I don't know if I was fighting the loud music or the loud people (maybe a combination of both) but I found myself yelling across the table to talk to my 3 friends. 

Our waitress was nice. But she would disappear 15 minutes at a time. I don't think I've ever waited that long for a water. Then it took another 30 minutes to get my appetizer. I didn't order anything else because I wanted to get out of there before midnight. 

Then the food was ok. I unfortunately didn't get the chance to try the pizza. I only got a pretzel appetizer - which basically tasted like salt. My friends seemed to enjoy their meals more than I. 

The only reason that I would return here soon is after a night of drinking on Mill. Maybe I'll try it again in 3 months once things get better established, at which point I will hopefully have the opportunity to revise this review."}
{"text":"If I could figure out how to get my mouth to stop watering just thinking about this place...I'll start the review.  Hold please!


Ok...I think I can do this.  OH. MY. GOSH!  I have been to Mellow Mushroom a few times and I can't tell you enough, how absolutely delicious this place is!  The first time I went, my friend and I shared a Greek Salad and a large Kosmic Karma pizza.  The Greek Salad is superb! (I, of course, removed the raw onions), but seriously, this thing was loaded with flavor! Lots of Feta cheese, kalamata olives, banana peppers and a very light but tasty dressing...WOW! Was perfect for a warm spring day in Arizona!  

Now on to the pizza...Kosmic Karma! Karma is not a B...it is a party in your mouth.  A very simple pizza, red sauce, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms, and the pies de resistance...the most beautiful swirl of pesto that encompasses all the flavors into one pie of perfection! Oh but wait! That's not the kicker...THE CRUST! You know it's a good crust when you hear it crunch when you bite and then all of a sudden it's just that perfect soft doughy-ness that you have always wanted? Yeah..that's it! Seriously! 

So that was just the one visit!

My most recent vist was just a couple of weeks ago after a hellacious week of learning and thinking...we just needed some time to unwind and Mellow Mushroom was the perfect spot for myself and a couple of girlfriends to relax and enjoy some mindless chatter and good food!  

Upon suggestion of one of the girls, we started off with the garlic pretzels, which to my surprise and complete satisfaction...are made of...THE CRUST! *insert teenage Bieber fan squeee here* Yes folks, you read correctly...THE CRUST that is perfection in my book! Garlicy and doughy and crusty crust with a side of very tasty marinara dipping sauce! For like $3.50 you get 3 full size soft pretzels.  Not bad at all.  

Then came the pizza! I am a creature of habit and ordered the Kosmic Karma.  I believe that what comes around goes around and I wanted to see that pesto swirl go around my pizza pie one more time! I wasn't let down either! It was another one of those moments where you end up making those \"happy food\" noises while eating.  No shame! I noticed my two friends were doing the same! One ordered the Philosopher's pie (steak, portabello mushrooms, artichokes) and the other ordered the Caesar  (literally a Caesar salad on a garlic pesto based sauce).  We left with our leftovers and I can say I was just as giddy to have them the next day as I was when it was first brought to the table! (Just make sure you heat them up in the oven so they don't have that nasty microvwav

Needless to say, we were very happy! They really need to make one of these places on the West Side!  It's worth the drive though!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place. I would say their pizza is pretty decent although quite pricey. $13 for a personal pan pizza, $20 for a medium pizza and $27 for a large. It tasted good but I'm not sure if it warrants that price. Mainly because I have tasted better for less. But hey, it's one of the only pizza places on Mill ave.

There's other items too such as hoagies and salads. And it does open late and serves pretty decent beer and other alcohol. So it is what it is if you are looking for something like pizza on Mill ave."}
{"text":"I pretty much only go here for their half-price apps during happy hour. Their wings are good, not the best, a little bit on the smaller side, but a good spot to go late night because their happy hour starts at 10. As far as late night food I would definitely prefer here over a Taco Bell, Federico's or any other fast food spot. Their pizza is also good. Unfortunately the service is often slow at night because they will send home their wait staff and leave the bartenders to do everything which drastically slows everything down. Not to the fault of the bartenders, theirs just too many people to accommodate. Management should really rethink those decisions."}
{"text":"Food is decent, however i just watched the bartender \"clean\" out his glasses with his water gun."}
{"text":"The place finally opened, with a name like Mellow Mushroom, we were wondering what the fuss would be all about.  The place was packed on a Monday night.  The theme is interesting, a lot of subtle references to the hippieness that seems to outline this restaurant, waiters were wearing shirts that say \"Baked Since 1974\", the appetizers are called munchies... Hilarious.   It was loud, so loud that the music was faint, to a point where it was a little irritating, though the atmosphere for a Pizza place has a lot of potential. 

The decor is interesting aswell, a few photographs of Phoenix as it is today, which shows the owner's love for the locals and this valley.  The food as I witnessed was fair, intresting combinations on their specialty pizzas, on paper that is.  When the pizzas slowly came out of the kicthen  there was a lot of dough surrounding the toppings in the center of the pie.  Honestly, the pizzas were not there yet, as far as taste and presentation, surely and hopefully that is only due to newly trained staff in the kitchen. 

Double orders were flying out, clearly miscommunication from the waiters to the kitchen...  Give this place a couple months at least, they should have their act together by Valentine's day. Let's hope.  The Stuffed Portebello \"Munchy\" (appertizer) was very good, though when it came with some really nice mixed greens on the side as an accompanying salad, it was overpowered  by a very thick balsamic glaze (supposedly a reduction)  The dish would have been perfect without the overdrizzle of that dark thick sauce...  Overall, it looks like the Mellow Mushroom is possibly working out their kinks, though the waitress should have never admitted that to our faces. 

There's potential, the menu is clean and simple, the staff must now back the reputation of this unique Pizzaria, since it does have to compete with Sauce, around the corner with very tasty dough and a much more professional cooking staff.  Possibly the best thing it has going is the extensive beer list that is on tap, the Purple Haze is okay  and very popular, the Apricot beer there is something else.  Good job on those GM, though pretzels? Stick to the theme: Pizza."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but was pretty underwhelmed. We ordered the Greek salad. It was fine,  no complaints. Also ordered the house special pizza. Again, fine. Crust was lovely, sauce just OK. Where the wheels fell off the wagon was the service. The waiter was initially attentive,  refilled drinks timely, and was pleasant.  He had trouble with another table near us and became completely flustered. Took away plates from the salad, brought the pizza but didn't bring new plates. We even asked another server who said she'd bring them but promptly forgot. We ended up walking up to the pass at the kitchen and getting our own plates. The sever we had asked watched us do it, realized her error and then stopped making any additional eye contact. Our original server never came back to fill up empty drinks,  didn't check on the pizza and took 20 minutes after we finished eating to finally drop off the check."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour with a HUGE beer selection, amazing pizza, great salads and a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what the pizza was. Pizza was not bad... But not great! Don't come here hungry because it will take quite some time for your pizza to arrive at the table . One good thing was the array of happy hour deals they have . Aside from that this place was overpriced and there is definitely way better pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is always good here, but the service in the bar area after the main dining area closes is TERRIBLE. Rt now I watching one girl attempt to handle one half of a busy and the other bartender on the other half doing the same. There is no table service. I watched 3 ppl literally sit at a table with no one tending to them. It's graduation week! You're restaurant is on mill, staff for it! This low rating is more management."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant after a Knights game.  My pizza order was incorrect; a new pizza with the correct ingredients was not presented as an option; the service was horrible and I was offered a mere 20% off my awful dining experience.  It was my first experience at Mellow Mushroom and definitely my last."}
{"text":"This place has super easy parking and a spacious inside with a large patio outside. The service was lackluster but the pizza was great! We ordered the kosmic karma and it was the best pizza I've had in months. Haven't tried anything else yet but I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"I always have the same experience at Mellow Mushroom in Rocky River. Great pizza and beer with mediocre (at best) service.  So the service is a 2-star experience but the pizza is a 4-star.

The greeting/seating is always weird -- the front never has anyone but eventually someone will appear and seem unclear why you are there.  Then it's always a wait for someone to take your order after you are seated and if you want anything later plan to get up to find someone.  No one is rude but barely helpful is the best description.  I've dined at Mellow Mushroom located in other cities and the service has been good.  But because they delicious gourmet pizzas and a nice draft beer selection I'll dine there occasionally.  I'd say give it a try and see what you think."}
{"text":"Ok, I had to come back, and had to bring my other son. The service was great, the Pizza, again, was GREAT!!!!! My son as well as my other son are both loving the pizza as well. So now all I can say is \"Woo Hoo!\""}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of the Norterra Mellow Mushroom since it opened, and was pleased to see this one launch on the City North strip. That small stretch of businesses needed something more to shake it up and give me a reason to head over and visit!
This Mellow Mushroom did not disappoint at all. The atmosphere is hip and inviting, and the separate little bar nook seating area is a nice change from the other north Phoenix location.
The pizza here is always a treat and the molasses they add to the crust gives it a nice chewy deliciousness that lends to the uniqueness. There is a good variety of speciality pizzas available for all palettes, as well as the usual build-your-own option. Also, if you have a lot of friends with you and an appetite, try a full order of awesome Parmesan-garlic pretzels for an appetizer.
The plethora of various beers on tap offer something for everyone. Tip: if you are thirty, order the large for a dollar more than the usual pint and you will end up getting a better deal."}
{"text":"The house pizza had lots of meaty ingredients and tasted great.  They also have an impressive craft beer selection.  This is a good choice if you are in the City North area."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the lower overall rating of 3.5 stars for Mellow Mushroom. I suppose everyone has a different experiences and expectations. In my three visits to Mellow Mushroom, I've always enjoyed a clean restaurant, friendly service, and unique pizza flavor combinations. 

My most recent visit found me dining with my two sons. Each of us ordered our own 10\" pizza (we can never agree on 1 or 2 selections between us). My oldest ordered the \"Pacific Rim,\" my youngest a plain cheese (there's one in every crowd), and I ordered a pepperoni, mushroom, sausage, and black olive for myself. 

The \"Pacific Rim\" comes with red sauce base with mozzarella, ham, bacon, caramelized onions, pineapple and jalape√±os. I don't know what it is with that kid and pineapple on pizza (shades of his mother, I guess) but I have to admit that I tried half of a piece and it was really delicious. I did not try the cheese that my youngest ordered, but the pepperoni, mushroom, sausage, and black olive (which I would consider a more standard, conventional pizza) that I ordered for myself was also really good. Chewy crust, robust sauce, a plethora of toppings... For a dine-in pizza chain I don't know where you can get better. 

A variety of other items are also available on their menu from appetizers to salads; from calzones to sandwiches; they even have desserts. While I have not personally tried any of these other offerings just yet, I'm definitely considering a calzone on my next visit. 

After three visits I'm satisfied that Mellow Mushroom is as consistent as they come. They've made my list of great little stops in Rocky River."}
{"text":"On Sunday afternoon 05/10/15, stopped for happy hour and ordered the 10 wings. It was if I order the Cornish hen bird. The wings was the size of my little finger. I left them on the plate. Paid the bill and wrote this review. I'm sure other items are very good. I will not return to this location. Thank you."}
{"text":"We came during happy hour from 3-6pm. We got wings and pretzels. I have never seen a smaller chicken wing but tasty. Pretzels were tasty especially with beer cheese. Ordered BBQ chicken pizza, great! Ordered Hot Potato pizza and it was very spicy! Ranch dressing with jalapenos was hot, hot, hot."}
{"text":"All appetizers are half off including the beer on draft & their unique cocktail menu. Bartenders super friendly, service is usually always quick. The environment is always fun if you sit at the bar and the always have the mystery shots if you're feeling mysterious, definitely recommend coming here if you're looking for a fun bar scene past 10pm. Open until 2am."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, they have a lot of beer on drafts. They have a mystery shot and it ended up being grey goose melon and it was only $3 a shot. No happy hour on weekends until 10pm-2am. They do have peartini and mellow yellow cocktail for $5 on weekends. Definitely recommend coming in and asking for ARon!"}
{"text":"We eagerly awaited the arrival of this new location. Great beer selection (and they are on TapHunter to boot).

Had the meatball trio appetizer and a loaded potato pizza - the food arrived in a timely manner and was quite tasty. 

Will definitely be back to try additional menu items."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza, fantastic beer selection, and a great casual vibe.  Will definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"We went here after lots if people raved about the pretzels and pizza. We got the pretzels an they were below average. The atmosphere was terrible (ugly decor) and our service was some of the worst I've ever had...all around a terrible pick. Will never go back and would never recommend it.."}
{"text":"I would eat the tempeh everyday if I could. The food seems shinier than usual of late. This is the second visit that we've felt this way. Still, the food is very good. It's not as \"local\" as we like but we appreciate their use of wholesome foods.

This is not casual gourmet. It's not a greasy dive. It's not chain. It's not local. Mellow Mushroom seems to me to create it's own niche. And for that we continue to return from time to time for a \"fix\"."}
{"text":"No longer has the Portabella mushroom appetizer. Also no longer has the Portabella mushroom sandwich. Was told this was a corporate decision. Also have changed their menu, it is quite a bit smaller... isn't this place called \"Mellow Mushroom\"? Needless to say we were disappointed in their decision."}
{"text":"Our server was bubbly and fantastic. Unfortunately the food was subpar-mediocre.

 I had an italian sandwich and my Mom had an Avocado sandwich. I don't think they put too much time into making their sandwiches taste very special. The Avocado sandwich was about as bland and generic as it sounds, not to mention they put onions in the sandwich when she requested no onions.

The italian sandwich was extremely generic/bland and I was hoping that they would have a good one, you can get an equally good or better Italian literally at any restaurant. They put so little vinaigrette on it that I couldn't taste it. They forgot to put on the onions, when I asked for onions I received a bowl full of very large pieces of onion. Pieces way too big to take a bite of and not be overwhelmed. Also, I think it's a bad idea to put Mozzarella on the sandwich, its pretty bland.

Also had pretzel bites that I keep hearing about. The taste like whole wheat (I think they are), maybe some people like that but the taste difference vs white bread is huge, I wouldn't but the pretzel bites again.

Aside from the server, the food was 2/10."}
{"text":"First experience here...Saw a 515pm movie at Ahwatukee 24 and went to the Mellow Mushroom nearby for dinner after. Normal restaurant trouble....Wait for 2nd drinks, one meal delayed out of 3....But the food was pretty good.  My one huge complaint was that when we got home I took a closer look at my son's leftover calzone....It was completely undercooked! I turned it over and it was all just dough....Like dough, dough.....And yea...That's not cheese!"}
{"text":"OK I'm impressed.  Was near Rocky River so I figured I would stop at the Mellow Mushroom and try the pizza.  Located on Detroit, MM is a large room with high ceilings, exposed ducts and plenty of 70's rock art.  The effect is nice, with a groovy mood.  

Since it was Monday I figured I would go for the $5 small cheese pie.  The pizza is excellent, with a nice balance of the 3 key elements.  The crust is nicely yeasty with some big air pockets and a good chewy texture.  The sauce is a good sweet sauce, which could have used a bit more spice, but worked well with the other parts.  Topped with an excellent portion of tangy cheese and then finished with some grated Ptarmigan.  Overall an excellent pizza.

A strong recommendation if you are a Za fan.  Also for the guys, check out the two portholes over the urinals which give you a view of the dining room, something just a bit different."}
{"text":"Manager did provide me with a $25 credit to make up for the experience. The second time around, the service was much better. Food wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"STOP! RUN! SAVE YOURSELF!!!  

Sunday afternoon, place is half full at best and it was the worst experience ever! I'm so embarrassed! I actually told people to go there! My experience with the Tempe location has always been good... Well, there's always been some wine involved but yeah, good times! 

We eventually got drinks... I ordered the Greek salad and half Italian sandwich. I'll accept partial responsibility for ordering something other than pizza and expecting excellence but this was seriously bad. 

Greek salad consisted of mostly iceberg (ICEBERG!) and a touch of romaine, a couple olives, 4 slices of Roma and super stinky white onions. Greek salad clearly calls for red... Dressing was some sort of thick muck similar to... oh, I don't know, spolied sour cream?

Okay! I just can't believe my eyes! Got the bill and I was actually charged $1.49 for shitty frozen supposedly red (but unrecognizable) potatoes!!! OMG!!! Don't ask me if I want 'chips or roasted red potatoes' like it's a 'choice' and then charge me for them! They were disgusting and I didn't even touch them! 

This place is dead to me... 3 hours of my life I will never get back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with Mellow Mushroom.  Although I'm more of a 'traditional pizza' type of guy, I don't mind some crazy combinations on my pie every once in a while... But I feel like some of the toppings on these pizzas are just over the top.  I don't need caramelized onions on top of my Buffalo Chicken pizza. 

I do like they fact that they'll let you split speciality pizzas in half!!  And the draft beer selection is fantastic.  Service was average at best.  I would be willing to try this again but I'll go to Edison's, Angelo's, Vincenza's before."}
{"text":"Holy cow slow slow slow.  Over 1 hour to get a pizza.  Asked 2 servers for Parmesan cheese to put on our pizza over 20 minutes.  Pizza was good but damn so so slow."}
{"text":"Been waiting forever for this location to open, as a rule I love the mellow mushroom. However, this new location has not figured out how to get food out of the kitchen in a timely manner. 9 of the 10 tables around us were complaining about waiting over an hour to get food. Also the runners running the food couldn't figure out what tables to serve all night long. This could have been an excellent experience but now it just has me wondering if it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Like normal, found this place thanks to good ol Groupon. Cant pass up a steal. As a pizza lover I was down to try a new place. We came in on Saturday, I want to say 5ish. They were semi busy, but we were seated right away. Server (Brendan, I believe) was very nice, and prompt. Started with the artichoke spinach dip, literally the best ive ever had, anywhere. Served with pita bread, it was SO good. Generous portion too, I thought. Or maybe I thought that because I had it to  myself as the kiddo didn't want any lol. He got the pizza kids meal. Sorta boring options on that end, but he didn't complain. I got the white pizza minus the onions. Very good. Thought the pizza was kinda pricey, but since we had to groupon it cut down the cost. I ordered some beer with the name \"vanilla\" in it, but pretty sure I was brought something else. 2 things I thought were a bit off, his kids meal came out even before the appetizer, and I was never brought a plate for my pizza so I had to eat it off the pan. Over all, I liked the place. Extremely clean inside, and friendly staff. I will be back, but probably not without another groupon."}
{"text":"Great service, our waitress definitely knew the menu and was very helpful.  

We ordered the fun guy and bbq chicken pizza.  The fun guy was too \"mushroomie\" for our liking.  But the bbq chicken was phenomenal.  The applewood bacon on top was ridiculously good and we highly recommend it on any of their pizzas!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is only about 2 miles from my home, so I have been there a few times. First of all, I think that the pizza is pretty good. It's not the best pizza that I've ever had, but the sauce is very tangy in the crust is excellent. That being said, I can never understand why I have to pay for each and every ingredient that goes into my salad. The bill is always quite pricey, as I can never get out of there without paying less then $40-$50 for two people. The restaurant is usually busy, so apparently a lot of people don't mind that the acoustics in the building make it so that you have to yell at each other across the table. It is quite loud. However, the outside dining patio is nice, but you have people in their cars pulling up right next to you and the last thing you want is to smell exhaust when you're trying to eat your pizza. All in all good things about this place. If you're wanting to try a different type of pizza, I would highly recommend this place. Just know that they're going to charge you for each and every tomato and cucumber you put in your salad."}
{"text":"The thai pizza was amazing, We have been wanting to eat here for some time and it was amazing to have had great service and the food was fantastic.. we have been here 2 times and it has been glorious they can split your pizza that was great with in it self. 
It not really quiet but is clean and pretty fun."}
{"text":"So disappointed! We read the reviews at other locations and was looking forward to checking this place out.  However, I was skeptical because at the end of the day, their prices are insane.  Take a basic salad starting at $4.99 and toppings range from .79 to $3.99  to add chicken or premium toppings.  Seriously?  You could end up paying $15 for a salad!

We ordered a large pizza half and half for carryout, half Bayou Blue and half Mushroom - $25 for the pizza.  I opened the pizza box before paying and was shocked. The toppings were minimal.  The half with Bayou blue - each slice had one piece of shrimp and one piece of sausage!  Keep in mind, this is a 18 inch pizza.  On the mushroom side, they forgot 2 of the toppings.  I ended up walking out without dinner.  Just couldn't fathom paying $25 for a pizza with little toppings and 1/3 crust.  So, we went back and forth with the manager, he kept trying to get us to pay 50% for the pizza. (Why?  Because they got it half right?)  What a joke.  Their entire menu is overpriced.  Do not go here.  If you are in the area, Dewey's in Lakewood, Pizza by Robert in Westlake, Roman Fountain, Lakewood (very fresh ingredients, edge to edge toppings awesome pizza and family run)...There are so many pizza locations to choose from.  This place needs serious work.  $ wise, totally not worth it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I like to go out for a good meal and a good atmosphere we choose Desert Ridge Mellow Mushroom , the service and the atmosphere is phenomenal it exceeds our expectations every time we go there and we have been going there for over 3 years , when You go there ask for \"Joe\" he is the best and we recommend the place to all of our friends and family ."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! Their menu is awesome the prices are decent the atmosphere is amazing. I absolutely love this place. However we've been there twice now and both times we've waited twice as long as what we were told, witness tables around a sit down after and get their food before us as our servers tell us that the pizza always takes a long time to make. Awesome beer selection, but the bears are too expensive and my opinion. another awesome thing is that they're open until 2 AM totally bar style. The server was really nice and helpful but it just takes too damn long!"}
{"text":"The drinking water is moldy. I lived in Seattle for 10 years and became hypersensitive to mold. When other people cannot taste it in the water I can. When other people cannot smell mold in the apartment I can.

Was not happy about the whole wheat pizza crust and pretzels. It was a little too different. 

Otherwise, the food is fresh, creative, and tasty. A lot to choose from on the menu.

Servers have lots of personality. 

Atmosphere is what really makes this place. Good to take out of town guests. The music is \"young\", and a little loud. Unless it's crowded, which is often. Then it's too noisy to really notice."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was slow! Did not get waters until we were seated for 15 mins. Had to track down our server just to get orders in. It was not busy so not sure what the issue was. To top it off there were flies. Fortunately my girls thought it was funny when I swatted one. If yelp support typed pictures I would post it as evidence!"}
{"text":"Obsessed!! My boyfriend and I love the crust and pizza selection. Our favorite pizza spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is my favorite place to drink on Mill, hands down. Their happy hour is phenomenal, with half off drinks and appetizers. I regularly come out full and tipsy without spending more than $10. As a beer lover, their rotating 48 beers on tap and $3 craft cans kill the game. Not to mention, $3 margaritas on Mondays. Say what?! Service is also incredible, and everyone always has a smile on their face. The bartenders are AWESOME. In my year of going here, I think I've had one mistake on one of my orders, and it wasn't even bad. I recommend this place to everyone and their mother."}
{"text":"I went last year for Selwyn day,  I really enjoyed the pizza, I could not tell it was organic.  I will definitely visit it again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Worst mellow around, waited 20 minutes to be seated...fine however we waited 50 minutes for our appetizer and then 70 something minutes for our one small pizza and burger. Waitress informed us of the bad kitchen service. However the other mellows we have been to when they take way too long or burn your pizza they give us 20-100% off to show they apologize. Nothing.... worst pizza I have had. Apparently the group next to us had to wait even longer for their food however they got compensated for their insane wait for....a... pizza...."}
{"text":"Much better the second time. Went here for breakfast and it was really good, they have quite a nice selection for breakfast including breakfast pizzas. Our waiter was very nice and prompt. I got eggs, smashed potatoes and toast, my wife got a create your own omelette. Next time I go I want to try their pizza again."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a restaurant in a long time. We waited 45 minutes for our order to be wrong. Manager never came by to check on us. I am usually understanding since I work in this industry but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"i constantly call this place magic mushroom when referencing it.... and tbh the food was just as forgettable. k bye"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the House Calzone and Spinach Salad tremendously.  Loved the minimal dough and beautiful presentation of the calzone.  I think the waitress was new as she came back 3 times to clarify my order- but very nice. Fun to look around the walls and ceilings.  My friend liked her Hoagie and the Homemade chips."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and wish I could give them a better rating. \"Meh, I've experienced better\" is exactly how I feel about this place.  The beer selection is definatly impressive but I feel there is a lack of unique craft beers. 

The first time I came to Mellow mushroom, our experience was awful.  Our waitress took her dear sweet time to do anything.  It literally took us over ten minutes to even place our drink order, and then she brought my friend out the wrong drink.  We bailed after one round and chalked it up to them having just opened.  The second experience here was actually much better.  Our server was prompt, knowledgable, friendly and very attentive; I was very relieved to see the service had improved.  My boyfriend and I ordered the all meat pizza and a salad as a starter.  The food was in no way bad, but it just felt like it lacked the wow factor.  

Overall I would say I leave Mellow Mushroom feeling like I never really want to come back.....its just \"meh\"."}
{"text":"I wrote a really long review for mellow mushroom once before but I'm not seeing it anymore for some reason so I'll state the quick pointers.

1.  The pizza is awesome.  Yes, it takes longer than 10 minutes to cook a GOOD pizza... so sit tight.

2.  The meatballs are amazing.... try them.

3.  Their beer selection is by far the best selection in the North Valley HANDS DOWN.

4.  The wait staff / management is super-friendly so don't be afraid to losen up and meet some new people while they are serving you.

5.  Happy hour is 1/2 all alcohol and appetizers... need I say more?"}
{"text":"I really want to give them 4 stars, but a majority of my visits here have been plagued by painfully slow service. Food is great, location is great, service is rough. 

We only saw our server twice tonight. Took about 10 minutes waiting at the table before we were acknowleged and asked for our drink order. We placed the entire order right then. Server told us it would be about 25 minutes for our large pizza; no problem. My pet peeve is waiting for the check and mellow definitely irritates me on this one. I consistently wait 10-20 minutes to get a check. Tonight's visit was closer to 20. I was getting up from my table to find someone when our server finally appeared. 

I will be back for the delicious pizza, but from now on it will be take out. Problem solved."}
{"text":"We came here after a wedding with a large group (20+). They were extremely accommodating, fast, and friendly. I was VERY impressed. The food came put very quickly, and our drinks were never empty. 

The pizza was very good, and the crust was unique. Almost like a wheat crust."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom was in Charlotte several years ago but because of a franchise dispute, they were all pulled out of the market.
I literally jumped for joy when I learned they were coming back. Simply put, you will not find a better pizza period. The only detractor is that is very pricey for a pizza and the menu can be a bit overwhelming.
Their calzones are also top notch.
Another great thing about Mellow Mushroom is the variety of beer. I am sort of a beer snob and enjoy many craft beers. Mellow Mushroom always seems to have something I have not yet tried.
If you have never been, you need to go yesterday."}
{"text":"Nice casual place to drop in for a pint.  

It's not the best run place when you see stickies on the wall with customer complaints.   It's a fun place though.  Nice bar, lots of beer on tap, and T-shirts with fancy mellow slogans.  The server told me that his shirt was the only one they had left and he hated his slogan.  Ok so maybe not everyone likes the shirts.

There are a lot of pizzas on the menu and they are reasonably priced.  Pizza is ok but there are much better within a few miles.   They deliver though and they are a notch above the other delivery joints in the area."}
{"text":"I was a huge Mellow Mushroom fan years ago when I lived in Atlanta... 
There were several locations there at the time and they never did me wrong.  I especially liked their pretzels and their signature Esperanza dressing.  So when I heard they were opening in Phoenix, I was psyched... and you'd think that with four locations within 25 miles, I'd have eaten at one of them before today, but that isn't the case.

So today when I realized that I had the time in my schedule to have lunch with my mother-in-law and son, I suggested Mellow Mushroom, and they obliged.  

When we walked in, I couldn't help but compare this location to the more casual and laid back atmosphere of the locations in Atlanta.  This City North location is fancier, but I guess that is what comes along with being in City North - a newish development.  

We were seated way in back in a booth and Gary was our waiter. He was friendly, and took our order in a timely manner, but the kitchen was supposedly way backed up due to a catering order and it took a good 45 minutes to get our food (2 salads and an order of kids mac & cheese).  I drank my entire water while waiting for our food and it was never refilled.  After waiting a good 30 minutes, I asked if my son could have some crackers since he was starving and we were given some chips... and then finally it arrived.  The kids portion was perfect and came with some apple slices.

When our salads finally came, we had to take them to-go due to time constraints. I'm not sure if it was because we got them to-go or because we didnt' get the pretzels, but neither the food or experience was as pleasant as my memories from years of visits to the Atlanta locations of Mellow Mushroom.

The manager did end up comping our meal due to the time we spent waiting, which was a nice gesture... but even so, if I return, I'd likely just call ahead and get my food to-go."}
{"text":"Three visits, food served incorrectly on two of the three visits.....

Our last server did not know the menu.  Isn't menu knowledge some 101 stuff for a server?

Anywhoo....it's not awful, just keep the expectations low."}
{"text":"Great food but sometimes slow service.  Sometimes it's like they forgot you were there and never come back to check on you.

It's good for a large event.  I used to bring work groups in for events.  Lot's of food options... I should say it was at the Awhatukee location though."}
{"text":"I love this place esp for happy hour . No , kidding my sister and I will call from the walmart checkout lane to put in a order of bread sticks. They are so delicious. 

Now if you go into eat they have fabulous pizza and cider beer. 

This place is out of this world and you just have to try it."}
{"text":"Try these place the first time, I think the food is so so. Our waitress was nice a friendly, pretty causal place the hang, lots of beer, but there are kids screaming, which is not cool."}
{"text":"We've tried the other location in Tempe on Mill Ave. That was pretty dang good. This place was eh, ok. We ordered an all mushroom pie, I forget the name. It hardly had any flavor at all.  The pie was very oily. I had to hold mine pointed down for a few seconds each slice to get the oil to run off it. We also ordered wings which were soo soggy. The skin was very soft and spongy, was pretty gross. Im sure theyre working out some kinks but for the price you pay you expect things to be perfect. I mean its a $22 medium pizza!"}
{"text":"First time there! Loved it! For my wife and I the price is always a major factor. We decided to splurge and we're glad we did! We split a 10' Holy Shitake Pizza and a half Jerk Chicken sandwich. The pizza was top notch! Never had that sort of flavor explosion from pizza before! The sandwich was great to though. Would def visit again if we were looking to splurge and get out of the usual routine restaurants we do."}
{"text":"I went in to order food at 10:15, the seaters told me that they stopped serving food at 10? What kind of food business stops serving food an hour before close and not even letting me place a to go order? In my experience it's usually close to the time the restaurant \"closes\" that they stop serving food. I'm not sure if this is a call from management or from the staff members but I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner before heading downtown. The atmosphere is really cool. Probably the nicest mellow mushroom I ever been too. Food is pretty pricey and I got to try there pizza and to be honest I didn't really like it. I did love there cheesy bread and spinach and artichoke dip that was really good. The waiter was pretty cool and you could tell the vibe at work was pretty chill and relax for them. Overall experience was just okay for me."}
{"text":"I must admit I frequent this place mostly for the Happy Hour specials. Half of Apps and Booze from 3-6 and 10pm to close. Most week days it pretty easy to find a spot to sit or a place at the bar, but come Friday and Saturday this place it full to the gills so get there early! 

Meatballs and Cheese bread make for a good snack, the pretzels are quick pick too. 
As far as pizzas are concerned, I usually stick with the Buffalo Chicken or a House Special. 

Service has been spotty in the past but things have gotten a lot better in the recent months. 

Large beer selection and full service bar, good for a few during happy hour and great place to bring your friends."}
{"text":"Pizza was over-cooked. The toppings were very tasty and good quality but I only ate the top of the pizza because the bottom of the crust was so hard it hurt. The crust is my favorite part so I was really disappointed. . The wings were small and way-overpriced. Soft drink prices were high. $14 for 4 soft drinks.  The atmosphere was neat and the waiters were generally polite but never came back to refill our expensive sprites. Party of 4- $80 for burnt pizza, inadequate wings and high priced soda. Save $ and go to Barro's Pizza. Barro's is Well priced, better quality at a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Family friendly, close to my house, and they serve any pizza you want on gluten-free crust. Fabulous. I have taken the kiddos here a couple of times and I have always received excellent service and good pizza. 

My husband begrudgingly eats here ... he thinks the pizza is just ok because the crust on their regular pizza is too thick for him. If you, too, are from the NJ/NY area, you might also want to try somewhere else. If, however, you want great toppings, nice servers, and a gluten-free option, come on down."}
{"text":"Great servers. Great environment. Great beer. Honestly I love this place a lot. They're all so respectful and they show you that they care for their customers. Been there several times and will keep going there. You gotta come check this place out"}
{"text":"I recently had a pizza delivered from here and I was definitely not very impressed. While delivery time was acceptable and the delivery man was very nice, I found myself having difficulty stomaching the pepperoni pizza I had ordered. What separates Mello Mushroom from other pizza places is the fact that they use a molasses-based dough for their pizzas. While this is definitely a unique tactic, I feel that it is a very poor decision. Molasses has a very specific taste which DOES NOT do well with typical pizza toppings like meat and cheese. Service was good, but the food certainly wasn't."}
{"text":"Happy hour hang out! Mellow is the best place to be casual, relax, and enjoy half off munchies(appetizers) and drinks from 3pm-6pm. Happy hour is available in the entire restaurant too! 

Went in today with a few friends on Wednesday and it was quiet at 4pm but by 5pm this place was packed! Seems to be the go to place for everyone who works within the norterra area. It's a nice big place with tons of tables, booths, and large patio when it isn't so stinking hot out! 

The service is excellent. Everyone is low key and friendly. Atmosphere has that relax hippie vibe as you will see referenced in the decor and menus. 

Since it was happy hour we got a bunch of appetizers. The pretzel bites, bruschetta, and baked sweet Thai chili wings. All are delicious! The beer cheese has a strong beer flavor which I love but my husband does not. So if you are not a fan of beer you may not like the cheese sauce served with pretzels. But they also have marinara and mustard instead! 

There pizza is also super good. Their crust is homemade with a ton of flavor and sprinkled with Parmesan. Their baked potato pie is to die for!!!! Mmmmm

Overall everything was excellent and looking forward to coming back. Every once in while they have a Groupon for $10 for $20 so keep a look out. 1 per table but alcohol is okay! (:"}
{"text":"I'm going to say it - and this is a statement years in the making, based on thorough research - this is my favorite pizza restaurant in Charlotte. And for many reasons, the pizza is number one obviously but also the cool ambiance, tons of outdoor seating and a great beer selection. If you have been to a MM, this is definitely one of the best. If you haven't, go! It's not cheap (maybe $25 for a large house??) but if you're sharing, it's not bad. Which, large pizza.... hello, you should be sharing! The have the best crust - very chewy and toppings, everything is very fresh. Couldn't recommend it more. It's a go-to family gathering spot."}
{"text":"Hung out at the bar and absolutely loved the ambiance and beer list. Ordered the pretzel app thinking it would be 6 pretzel bites and they were full pretzels! But they were so good we ate them all anyways! Definitely will be coming here more"}
{"text":"Cool decorations, the restaurant is movie themed. Regarding the food, perfect Mellow Mushroom pizza. Funky Q chicken is the way to go."}
{"text":"Went for cocktails Saturday night. They have a nice late night crowd with a reverse happy hour. I was impressed with the friendly bartenders. They Kept a tight watch on under age drinking. This place is well managed . I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good pizza! We've been here a few times, my kids and I. Friendly staff, good prices too. Signed up for their mailing list and got coupons in the mail for a huge discount off a pizza. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Awesome happy hour prices and a huge selection of tap beers. That's the only thing Mellow Mushroom has going for it. The appetizers are decent, and I usually get an order of the pretzels with beer cheese when I go, but they are underwhelming.

As for the pizza- it makes me sick every time. Every. Time. I have never had issues with pizza (in fact I just finished lunch at NYPD Pizza) before so I'm not sure what the deal is, but I assume there's something going on in the kitchen that I would rather not know about.

I'll be back for the beers during Happy Hour, but that's about it."}
{"text":"FLIES EVERYWHERE! Ick. I don't like having to fight with the flies for the first bite of my food. Not to mention the pizza makes me sick every time I go. If the flies in the dining room are any indication of the conditions of the kitchen, I think I'm better off eating elsewhere.

The one star is because they have awesome happy hour beer prices and a huge selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that the food was pretty good. Tried both the shiitake pizza and the house pizza. Both were ridiculously good. Fresh ingredients and quality items. It's a little pricey, but well worth it. 

The service was great as well! Very fast, friendly, and knowledgable. They really do have a great team! 

Why the three stars? The kitchen is a hot mess. No other way to put it. At my table, we had 5 pizzas redone because the kitchen messed them up. That being said, it also took 3 hours for the group as a whole to get food. 

In all fairness, we had a big group.  No one is perfect and there will be mistakes. Even the time it takes is expected to be longer, but not 3 hours. 

I will give this place another shot in a few months and hope that all the \"newness\" has worn off. I really hope that this turns out to be a great place we can come back to."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the pizza and beer was great. Neither time did I have to wait, even on a Saturday night. They have an amazing selection of beer from all over and a good local variety as well. I've only tried the pizza and both times had the same one that had a lot of the basic toppings on it. I have to rank this is some of the best pizza around. The ambience is a little blah, probably because it's not been super busy when we've been there."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's a twist on something that we all know so well. The pizzas are all a little different but you do have the option to create your own, my favorites are the p'zones and their hummus. Their food can be a little pricey especially if you start to build you own pizza or p'zone."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Mellow Mushroom from my university days so once I discovered there once one in Cleveland, I was excited to check it out to see if it still had the nostalgic taste i remembered. During this visit I ordered the Pretzel Bites and Beer Cheese as an Appetizer. The pretzel bites were very tasty and came with a dusting of Parmesan cheese which was a nice touch. The serving of Beer Cheese and Pretzel bites was pretty generous. For the main course, I ordered a medium pizza with pepperoni and anchovies.(One of my all time favorites). The pizza came out after a short period and was cooked to perfection. The crust was also dusted with another helping of Parmesan cheese. Overall the pizza was very good. Slightly salty but that i attribute mainly to the toppings themselves. If you are looking for truly authentic Italian pizza, this isn't  the spot to visit, however if you want a good pizza, this place will get the job done."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I love this place! I always get the red skin potato pizza and it's to die for! Vanja is the best server also! So cheerful and got everything out on time and perfect!"}
{"text":"Yum!! This place is so good!!  Didn't get the baked wings this time but it is one of our favorite items on the menu. Got the Large Holy Shiitake pie with bacon added, definitely my favorite pizza here. And the Caesar salad was exceptional!"}
{"text":"egg and prosciutto pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Sooooooooooooooooo goooooooooooooooooood!! 

Worth the drive, worth the wait, worth 5+ stars! 

Yes the decor is not so good, so what! 

We also ordered a pepperoni, it was a good pizza, but it just couldn't compare to the oh my goodness amazing egg and prosciutto pizza. 

The service was great, friendly and accommodating! The bar tender was so nice and our waitress was too!"}
{"text":"Our waitress (in training) and her trainer were great, I ordered the red skin potato on recommendation from someone, and it was ok, guess just not my thing. I will stick with the egg and panceta. They didn't have any clean dishes when we had our app, so we had to eat the app from the main plate, very akward... they were aware and apologetic, that fixes it for me :)"}
{"text":"Second time here. Food is decent, maybe a little overpriced but not bad.  Main complaint is the acoustics in the place. It's almost like the designers got together and said, \"I know, let's create an atmosphere where you have to scream at the person next to you in order to be heard. That would be such a unique experience!!!\" It is so ridiculously loud in here. Otherwise, not a bad place."}
{"text":"Was so excited about mellow mushroom opening around the corner from us we went on the grand opening for lunch and had a great experience! Understandably a bit of a wait for our food (35 min) but it was the first day so let it slide. Went again today with our neighbors for my husbands birthday and it was a TERRIBLE experience. 
Arrived at 1pm, No wait for a table. 115 order taken, 210pm food arrives for half the table (minus the kids meal and one main dish), 215 ask again about kids meal \"oh ya that will take awhile longer\" wait a kids mac & cheese will take 1 hour to make? No apology from the waitress, she actually seemed to ignore us like we were bothering her. 240 still no mac & cheese for the toddler, cancel it & ask for bill. Bill comes with no apology 10 minutes later. Finally a bald manager comes to apologize for the wait, appreciate that but man these yelp reviews dont lie!! Dont go to MM if you want good service or your food served timely. Back to downtown Gilbert we go, at least they have great service."}
{"text":"Met a friend there for lunch yesterday. i was thrilled that they had vegan pizzas!  After ordering and eating, the bill came and every addition was $1.99.  Basically there was about one mushroom for $1.99, maybe 5 olives for $1.99, three leaves of spinach for $1.99, a slice of onion for $1.99, I asked for vegan (non-dairy no cholesterol) cheese (which they have) and didn't see any on the pizza.  Don't order the thin crust, it was practically burnt.  It's too thin!  There is a pizza place in Gilbert (NYPD on Market Street, but I actually have to ask them to not put so much vegan cheese on!)  I'd rather go there.  At least I feel I get my monies worth.  We used a Groupon coupon and MAN was it an expensive lunch!  Never going back.  The waitress was perfection though. My \"friend\" told her how unique her name was and \"did her mother have something to drink when she named her\"?  I was so embarrassed.  That's like saying your name is hideous!  She was very kind and a great server."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here (as I almost always do). I had a fantastic margarita in front of tons of huge TVs with bunches of sporting events available. Aaaaand I was able to get an incredible gluten free pizza at what I thought was a  really fair price for the quality of the toppings. It's a chain, sure, but a solid bet."}
{"text":"Bar far my favorite location. Beautiful patio and friendly service. It's perfect setting for hanging out and enjoying some good beers. 3-6 happy hour with a reverse from 10- to close. Whenever we're in the area we always stop in and enjoy the scene. I hope eventually they can put one closer the west side closer to westgate."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was ok. Server was friendly. Manager was incredible unprofessional- he was yelling to his staff at the hostess stand from the kitchen. It went in for an uncomfortable long while. Very startling. Kids were present and heard his profanity"}
{"text":"Hey gals and folks literally by far the best customer service by far!!!! Not only that the vibe in this place was super positive!  Great vibes super laid back, Robert the server there was running bar, server, bar back, cook, dishwasher everything, Robert was the best, super awesome!  Wow thank you! I'm definitely bringing my friends here and I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Mellow Mushroom. Wide selection of pizza offerings."}
{"text":"I'm really shocked to see negative reviews.  I've been to this Mellow Mushroom 2xs since it has opened and both me and the people I have been with loved it.  Both times I went on a Saturday night and at the most waited 15 min to be seated.  The small salad was big enough to share for two people.  My favorite pizza so far for this meat lover has been the veggie.  
The veggie had tofu on it, which sounds like it wouldn't work but actually complimented the pie nicely.  But I think the wow factor is their crust.  I don't know what's in it, but it is so dang good.  They had a huge selection of beer and spirits and their regular drinks come in gi-normous cups so you will never need a refill.  Will be back again soon fo sho!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, my main complaint was that my son ordered a calzone priced at $10.79. by the time he added chicken and his selected vegetable the calzone was over $26.00.
He enjoyed it, but no calzone is worth that. We ordered two large pizzas, both were good, a few salads and spent over $160.00 (before tip).
The manager came over and explained the pricing and actually agreed that the add- ons were ridiculous and offer a way to order in the future that may be better. I did not ask for a discount and he did not make any adjustment( bad decision) I will not go back EVER.

If he would have even taken $5.00 off that would have made me felt like he cared if I came back or not. they are very busy at this location so I am sure they wont miss my business but I will certainly be telling anyone who asks me about my experience.

Maybe as a whole the company can look into a better way to charge and not to mention training the server to let the customer know that each item will be costing $2-$4.

Even though the pricing is listed on the menu..."}
{"text":"Visited Mellow Mushroom on a week night and wasn't very impressed. The space is pretty big, but it was not very crowded.The pizza took a really long time to be made and wasn't very hot when it came out. I appreciate that there are lots of vegan and gluten free options and lots of veggie toppings to add , but I likely won't visit again."}
{"text":"Only tried the hoagies because that's what we were able to afford that night but they were delicious. Can not complain there. The service was good but has room for improvement."}
{"text":"Two of us enjoyed the Thai pizza with chicken.  Although there was very little chicken to enjoy, the other flavors were very good. We shared a bottle of house merlot; featured AND awful.  This location was quite busy (and noisy) on a Thursday evening. The service was very good, the pizza was served quickly. There seemed to be alot of wait staff working. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The pizza selection was helpful. I really did like the Italian bread with cheese appetizer ! We selected a half and half large pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms! Lastly the pizza sauce and garlic flavored crust was amazing!"}
{"text":"Such HORRIBLE customer service I made a yelp account just to write this review. MAX was our server on Monday night and that will be the last time we go to this Mellow Mushroom. We went there for a friends birthday and our waiter seemed irritated to serve us, rolled his eyes at us, and even confronted a girl in our group as we were leaving about how he was unhappy about his tip."}
{"text":"DUDE MELLOW MUSHROOM IS AWESOME! 

The boyfriend and I went on a Thursday night with two of our close friends. We were surprised that they were so busy on a weeknight. We didn't want to wait, but we were assured that we'd be seated as quickly as possible so we headed to the bar for a drink. OOOH, the beer selection! They have a lot of draft beer and we all tried something new! 

We only waited about 15 minutes before we were seated at a lovely booth with funky designs... very snazzy! Our waitress was adorable and  sweet and greeted us very promptly with a smile. She told us our pizza would be \"made to order\" (which is amazing to me being that I've worked in the restaurant biz before!) so we ordered some appetizers to munch on and they came out fairly quickly.  We all shared a bruschetta and spinach dip both of which were quite possibly the best I've ever had anywhere. 

We ordered a large house special pizza to share between the four of us, and after the beer and appetizers It was definitely enough for us all to split! They do not skimp on the toppings or cheese! It was so delicious that there were no leftovers, not even the crust was left on the plate! 

All in all, the experience was great. The pizza was totally worth the 25 minute wait! (just like our waitress said!)  We will definitely be going back next week!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and excellent service. The crust is perfect on the pizza, salads are full and delicious. Very attentive wait staff and the manager came to check on us and ensure our large party was taken care of. The prices are very reasonable. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"As a 3-year patron of the Happy Valley Mellow Mushroom, I never missed an opportunity to rave about the place.  When this location opened just 5 minutes from my house, I thought for sure it was a gift from God.  However, after 3 visits, I will never be returning to this restaurant, and will happily make the longer trek to Happy Valley, where I know I will leave satisfied.

Our first visit was 2 hours long.  Not by our choosing.  Not only did it take them over 30 minutes to get us our drinks (a water and a coke), but then an hour to get our meals.  And my husband's meal was wrong, they offered to make him the pizza he really ordered, and we obliged.  Had we known it would take them another hour to make the freakin thing, we would have said no thanks.  This was only a few weeks after they had opened, so we thought that maybe it was because they were still getting their bearings, and didn't realize how busy they would be (even though the place was empty).  So we gave them another shot.

The next time, we got take out pizza from them.  It was cold but I suppose I can't blame them for that.  This visit is not the reason I am writing this review.

The last straw occurred last week, on Wednesday, October 10th.  I had family in town, my sister and 1 year old niece, and we brought our 2 month old son to dinner as well.  The 5 of us requested to sit outside because it was just plain gorgeous out.  We arrived before 7pm.  Upon going outside, I immediately was hit with the smell of cigarettes, so I tried to pick a table that seemed to be further away from the smell, thinking it was just some passers by outside the restaurant.  I unknowingly had chosen a table closer to a table where a few men were smoking.  Now I was under the impression that smoking was no longer allowed in restaurants...I didn't think this was new news.  My husband politely asked the server what their policy was on smoking and she said after 10pm they allowed it.  (Which I still think is bull).  Since it was well before 10pm, she asked the men to move.  They stepped just outside the bar area and the lovely draft made the stench even worse, but we couldn't complain since they weren't technically in the restaurant anymore.

Our food arrived and it was good, but our conversation kept getting interrupted by some loud people, who turned out to actually be servers, who kept going over to the smoking table and socializing with the men, who were also servers.  I discovered this because when the men left the table, it was shortly reoccupied by two female servers on their breaks who promptly lit up as well.  Not only is this illegal, but with two babies nearby, it is extremely inconsiderate.

When we left, we were all very disappointed, and embarrassed because we had raved so much about this place to my guest and it was such a terrible experience.  My husband went in and asked for a manager, unfortunately he didn't ask her name, but he had the sneaking suspicion that she was not actually a manager, but a server pretending to be a manager.  He asked this person what their policy was on smoking and she said they allowed it \"on the ends but not in the middle.\"  What the heck kind of smoking policy is that, and why were we told something different before?  

We will NEVER be going back to this location, and I suggest that unless your favorite pizza condiment is second hand smoke, you don't go here either."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the last time.  This use to be our go to spot for pizza. The last few visits it has steadily gotten worse.  The service here was well below decent, the pizza was raw and the wait was an hour for two pizzas.  I counted 9 people working in the kitchen and over 12 working front of house. The restaurant was less then half way full and outside wasn't busy. There is no excuse to wait an hour for a half cooked pizza.  We asked the manager how much longer and without even an apology was told it should he soon. 30 mins later our pizzas came.  We witnessed one of the cooks take pills while working. Placing his hand to his mouth and then making a pizza without washing them.  This was by far the worst dining experience I've had in a long time.  If you want average pizza for two for $30 that comes with slow lazy service and a dry mouth cause your cup is always empty as well as a long wait then this is your place."}
{"text":"Overpriced pizza in my opinion.  They have a delicious crust but the actual pizza is lackluster.  Ample seating at this location.  I was disappointed in the service.  Had to request silverware and napkins more than once.  Waitress would come to refill empty water glasses and only refill one before promptly abandoning the area for an extended period of time. 

Ordered  a side salad, one small pizza and one calzone.  With tip it averaged 17 per person.  I think 34 dollars is a little steep for a very small pizza, a salad and calzone. 

Probably will not return to this restaurant which is disappointing because I used to really enjoy their pizzas about 15 years ago."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, pizza was just OK and I thought pretty pricey.
Our waiter Corey was fantastic, helpful, knowledgeable and attentive.
I will give it another try to see if it was just me and not Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Be prepared to be underwhelmed. After we spent the day in Jerome we came here for what we thought would be a quick bite. I ordered a burger. The meat was rancid. I sent it back. I didn't want anything else. My husband had a philly cheesesteak sandwich and it was zero flavor. The manager came over and agreed after tasting it. The service was equally crap. We waited about 5 mins before we were greeted by the 3 that were just talking at the host stand. Another 10 mins for a table. Not worth the wait. So what was the remedy? Nothing they took the items off and still charged us for the soda. We ended up still spending about 50 on pizza wings and sodas for the other 2 people that were with us. Dont waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I am so glad I had a Groupon because this place is over priced and just ok.  The crust is ok, not that great and the sauce is terrible.  We will NOT be back.  All hype and about the atmosphere, not the food."}
{"text":"**1/5/12 UPDATE ADDED AT END**

After waiting a few weeks for the restaurant to find some internal rhythm, the wife and I went at 4pm on a Saturday to see if this would become a local site to be worked into our rotation.

The place was very busy, but we did get seated right away. The first time we tried, we were told there would be a 60 min wait, and coming in the late weekend afternoon seemed like the best time to get in.

The table they chose for us, though, was in some weird little section right adjacent to the kitchen; combined with the hard surfaces and odd angles of the area under the stairs, the noise was just horrible. We finally got moved to a table under the balcony, which was much better.

The wife is on a gluten-free diet, so seeing that they offered a gluten-free pizza, there was much rejoicing in the land. Unfortunately, the pizza they served us wasn't a cause for celebration. It was what they termed a \"Hawaiian\" (red sauce, mozzarella, ham, pineapple), but aside from a lot of sauce, there were hardly any toppings on the pizza, most especially a lack of cheese.The pizza was for someone on a gluten-free diet, not someone who is lactose intolerant. It was a really, really weak offering. It also arrived to the table warm (certainly not hot), which suggested it had been lounging in the kitchen awaiting our server to bring it to us. 

Ultimately, a medium pizza, a small salad, a local beer and a diet Coke came to $36 with tip. On the one hand, not an outrageous sum, but on the other, far too much to pay for mediocrity, which is what we were presented today. For $20 we can get a frozen Bella Monica gluten-free pizza at Earth Faire which is superior in every way to what was served \"fresh\" today

I don't know if we will ever return--I suppose we will, assuming the tenor of the reviews here improves over what has been posted to date--but this was a massive disappointment on every conceivable level. Management would be well-served to shut the place down for a week and review staffing, training and procedures before claiming to be a professional restaurant.

***1/5/12 SPECIAL BONUS UPDATE to include the oh-so-helpful comments from \"Hot potcket T.\" (no, that's not a typo)

\"Sir you're an idiot for even taking that much time out of your day for that one particular comment. I see your pizza wasn't cut thoroughly but I would assume you know what a knife is!? Or maybe \"the wife\" could help you. I'm sure they would love your business and for you to come back but they would also love patience. They did open 2 weeks ago! And you obviously know NOTHING about the restaurant biz bc you can't just shut down a restaurant that's already open to train people, again! Please think before you speak.\"

It is always impressive when someone, brave with equal parts righteousness and anonymity, rushes to call another person \"an idiot\" in a preamble to an error-filled message.

1) I wrote nothing about how our pizza was cut. That was *another person's review*.

2) I acknowledged in the opening paragraph that the restaurant recently opened. I would never pan a restaurant based upon an opening weekend. On the other hand, this is a formula restaurant and part of a local chain, so it isn't as if everything is unique to this Ballantyne location, and we didn't go in at a peak time, either. I've done my tour of duty in a pizza joint, too, and when the kitchen is run well, it is relatively easy to keep the customers happy and get the pies delivered without excessive wait times.

3) The comment about shutting down for a week was such obvious hyperbole that it only makes sense that \"Hot potcket T.\" was lost at sea. I think most everyone realizes that it isn't cost-effective to shut down a restaurant for a week to retrain unless Gordon Ramsay is doing the retraining and the TV show he's filming is covering the lost operating revenue. I was merely stated that the restaurant appeared so rough around the edges that it would benefit from a week offline just to get its house in order.

4) Finally, the comment that Mellow Mushroom would appreciate \"patience from me\" is just bizarre; I didn't dictate when the restaurant was obligated to begin operations, so if it needed more time, then an internal decision was made to open regardless of readiness. Furthermore, nobody offered to cut me a deal on the pricing of our food if the restaurant felt it wasn't ready for prime time. If I'm paying full fare, I think as a customer I have a right to that restaurant's full level of service. Why am I supposed to cut it some slack if it's going to charge me the full price for what it acknowledges isn't it's best effort?

If the Ballantyne Mellow Mushroom is truly run by professionals--that is to say, not by whiny twits like \"Hot potcket T.\"--they they will take some of the comments from the *paying customers* here to heart and work to improve the restaurant."}
{"text":"Roller derby and pizza, what could be better? I went to a Charlotte Roller Girls event here and was impressed by the variety of beers on tap and by their pizza's immaculately baked crust. The pizza I got was deliciously greasy, probably because I had them throw almost every meat in the joint on top. Mmmm... carby..."}
{"text":"What a great experience this time!! Service was prompt, refills of drinks came quickly without having to ask, and the pizza was hot and delicious. The salad was fresh and crisp, the waitress was great. Thank you for changing our opinion of MM. :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars for Anthony's incredible service and performance!!  He's knowledgeable with clever, quick wit, he makes the dining experience fun!  He had my dad laughing out loud which is really saying something!!  Pizza is very good! We prefer original crust...it's actually fairly thin.  Ingredients are fresh and meat is good!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in to get dessert so we ordered the big triple chocolate chunk cookie with ice cream.  The ice cream and the chocolate drizzle was delicious.  The cookie was not as thick and soft as we'd like.  Not bad though if you like a big crunchy cookie."}
{"text":"Second time here. Food has been great. Lunch was a great deal I got the meatball hoagie and a side salad it was pretty big!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about Mellow Mushroom, but my experience left much to be desired.  We went on a Saturday night around 7:15 with a party of 6.  The place was not busy at all, yet they seated us upstairs all by ourselves.  It took forever to get our Margaritas (which were a steep $9.50 for a small glass mostly filled with ice).  The Bruschetta and Artichoke Dip were ok, but the pizza was horrible.  We got the Kosmic Karma and there was sooooo much sauce, that's all we tasted....and it was really expensive.  I've had better frozen pizzas for a fraction of the price.  What a was of money.  Will never go back."}
{"text":"First time at this location. It was not very busy, but it was a Monday. The inside of the restaurant is way cool. It has an old movie theme. 

The pizza dough is really good. I had the Funky Q Chicken. It has a BBQ sauce instead of pizza sauce.. I requested it without onions. What is cool about this place is that they offer gluten free and vegan free food. Not many places do that. There is something for everyone such as wings, soups, sandwiches etc.. I was told they offer a Groupon deal. My server asked me that before requesting my tab. They also have a check in offer at this location but it's for salads only."}
{"text":"I did not like anything about this place. We started of with bruschetta. Over 8$ for dry bread out of a bag topped with pre cut old tomatoes. Main meal was a small pizza. Starting at 11$ something without any topping. Its pretty thin. We decided on the olive oil & garlic instead of red sauce. You could not even taste it. All in all it was way overpriced for the kind of food. If you want some good bruschetta go to the vig in phoenix and if i want thin pizza i go to fired pie. 7.99$ with as many toppings as i want. I really dont mind spending money on food but the level needs to match the price."}
{"text":"Food is generally good.  (Mostly).  Service not so much. And the more and more times we come, the more I can't think of why.  A plain hamburger costs more than a special one.  Dirty cups.  Dusty.  Yuck."}
{"text":"This is a family establishment with open seating on the patio and at the bar. The food is mediocre at best, however I do recommend the PBR cheese. Service was impeccable despite the lack of flavor."}
{"text":"Best calzones. I've had calzones at several other pizza places and none come close to Mellow Mushroom. There is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"So horrible! We used the online system to order and was given an exact pick up time. We were there just a couple minutes early and live right down the street. Our pizza was cold, had very little sauce and did not taste good. We had ordered half with meatball and about 3/4 was meatball leaving very little for me to eat as I am not a meat lover. We also had added two cookies (peanut butter cup and oatmeal) to our order. The peanut butter was so greasy...I am a cookie LOVER and this was a far cry for a good cookie. My husband threw out the oatmeal raisin and said it was awful. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Don't sit at the tables near the bathroom. Too much traffic! Wings are amazeballz!! You have to have the beer cheese. And try a dirty campfire beverage. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"So second visit, and both times we never got our food?? No manager ever came over, even though our waitress said she would send one over. It was another horrible experience. Got there at 9:40pm, leaving now starved?? The waitress said the kitchen gets overwhelmed, however the table next to us who got there 20 minutes after us, after requesting their food to go due to the long wait, actually got their food, they were brought their food in boxes???? We left with nothing?? We ordered one pizza and 3 calzones, no specialty??? It was on the menu?? The fact that nobody cared, the waitress knew we were upset and could have cared less even after we sat there for 90 minutes. Why does anybody eat here????"}
{"text":"This is in response to Mellow A. 

We where there at lunch time and no one said anything about lunch specials.  Really should have a lunch time menu if that's the case and have staff inform people of those specials.  I will come back again and check out these lunch specials, thanks!"}
{"text":"If you can splurge on good pizza & drinks this is a great spot. Pizza, salads, & drinks are great. I was pleased that my RB margarita was not watered down. Prompt professional service. Very clean. Bathrooms were very clean. Nice outside eating available."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Mellow Mushroom Pizza. I grew up here but lived back easy for a while and everywhere I went I always saw their locations and loved eating there so when I saw they expanded here finally I was stoked. 

Their buffalo chicken pizza is the best one out there and they have the best choices for pies around. The only thing is their wings are not spicy at all. We got hot and my 3 year old was eating them without batting an eye."}
{"text":"This place has got to be my favorite pizza joint. I'm from out of town and every time I stop I'm AZ it's a must to pay this place a visit. First off, my absolute favorite pizza is the magical mystery with sausage bites. It has jalape√±os that awaken your taste buds and gooey cheese that compliments their dough in all aspects. Pair it with the artichoke spinach dip and the garlic parmesan pretzels! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"Always the coolest place to grab a craft beer on tap, a mouthwatering specialty pizza, and hang out with good friends and incredible service!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, but awful, horrible service. We called ahead and put our name on the list, but when we got there they would only seat us inside. With 3 kids, one very little, we really didn't want to be stuck inside. They had empty outside tables, but refused to push 2 tables together for us so we had to wait for two parties to leave next to each other then push them together ourselves. 

After ordering, our salads and drinks didn't show up even after asking multiple times. We waited over an hour for our 2 pizzas. How long does it take to make pizza? And they never did remember our pretzel even though they charged us. The pizza was ok but after waiting so long I really didn't care."}
{"text":"As far as chain pizza joints go, in my opinion Mellow Mushroom is about as good as it gets. There's something about their crust - it's amazing! They have great salads as too. I'm also a fan of the trippy decor."}
{"text":"I don't have anything really earth shattering to say here. I just think the pizza here is kind of \"meh.\" The crust and sauce are not bad, they are just not something to rave about. The service is usually attentive, which is nice. I don't see me going out of my way to come here though."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I used to love Mellow Mushroom, I've been to two locations had nothing except wonderful service and food. I can't say the same for this location. We were there around 8PM on a Friday there was no wait except for service to your table.  As we were seated our server appeared requesting drink orders, my husband had never been so it might been nice to be given just a second to look over the beer choices. I ended up only ordering water bc I didn't enjoy a server standing over my while I choose my beer. Our spinach artichoke dip was ok different than most but ok. Our food arrived in a timely manner, sadly it's just not the MM pizza I remember.  First the good, my husband ordered a meatball sub that totally enjoyed!! It certainly was a huge portion to say the least!! Now the not so the pizza dough was a bit tough and although cooked through a tad \"doughy\". To me that means old dough or not properly prepared dough. I know as I make bread often. There was almost something extremely hard and crunchy in the crust. At first I was afraid I'd chipped a tooth as the crunch was normal crust crunch and could not be \"chewed\" whatever it was I found in 3 of the 4 slice 10inch. My water was empty more than full and we waited over 15 minutes for a second beer-----that's after it's been requested, it arrived as we were requesting to go boxes. Needless to say that beer didn't get consumed as we were finished with our meal and requested to go boxes. When she dropped off the boxes she asked about dessert we said no thanks we are good to go, you'd think \"I'm ready for our check\" didn't need to be said since we declined dessert. We still had to wait and wait then finally track down our server for our check. I'm sure it's not easy being a server but please at least act as if you like your job and pretend you are happy!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing more awesome than finally getting home after sitting in traffic daydreaming about pizza, only to bite into a raw slice. And no it wasn't just extra cheesy. Sorry mellow mushroom. Y'all are way too mellow when it comes to your cooking standards. Good bye."}
{"text":"Sigh! It was so good in the beginning! But now I have to make a review. On Oct. 17, 2015 between 2:00 to 2:30pm. I placed an order for the Teriyaki Chicken hoagie, I was kinda in a rush so I ordered the half sandwich thinking that it will only take a few minutes... Wrong!!! 15 to 20 minutes for a HALF SANDWICH to be made... Really?!!! I got it anyway. I left to go pick up a few things while they were preparing my food; came back, the server said it was going to be an additional 5 minutes for my sandwich to be ready!

  At this point I'm getting pissed off due to the fact that I only have 3 minutes left on my lunch and my sandwich is not ready. The guy who took my order apologized for the delay and spoke to his manager about the matter. A lot of apologies and at the end I got a refund along with my sandwich... Thank you!

  30 minutes later, I finally got the chance to sit down and eat my sandwich that I waited so long for to eat... Here's were my anger falls into play, I go to take a bite out of my sandwich and a couple pieces of meat falls out the bottom of my sandwich... One piece in particular STOOD OUT! \"The Hell is that?\"... Is that a hair?!!!! Sigh!... I waited for this sandwich all to have a hair in my damn sandwich! 

  Fast forward to 5 minutes later... I wrapped up the piece of chicken with the beautiful luxurious piece of hair on it called Mellow Mushroom and asked to speak with the manager about the situation that unfolded before me. Took the sandwich back and again had a lot of apologies and offered me a new sandwich with 2 $5 gift cards and a bottle of water for the wait. 

  Got my sandwich and walked away with my water and 2 gift cards... But over all this was my 2nd bad experience with them and I don't know if I'll spend my money here again because of it. Hey! It's just my experience and I thought I would share it, maybe yours could be different."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now and while the food is great, but the value isn't there.  It's just too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Mellow mushroom is a weekly thing for us. I have ordered from there at least 10 times. We only do take out so this review is on the food alone. I am plant based and LOVE that they have options here. I don't know why more restaurants don't carry veg options. But I always get the mega veggie pizza. They tell you to get it vegan just ask for no feta. But that NEVER works. And hence the 4 star review. If they trained their employees on the vegan options then I would have no complaints. Other than the parking for pickup seems to ALWAYS  be taken by some ahole eating in. So this is what I have learned if you want a vegan pizza and hate dayia cheese. It's nasty. LOTS and LOTS of amazing vegan cheeses out there now. No need to carry dayia anymore guys. It's sick. 
Order the mega veggie with NO CHEESE (if you order no feta they will just add mozz) I also prefer to exclude the tofu, broccoli , sundried tomato. I add extra banana peppers and artichoke. Sounds simple but I have only had it made correctly 2 or 3 times out of prob 13 lol. 
But this pizza is so so good. And I only eat half the small and have the other half the next day since the bread is so filling. It's the best dough I've ever had!!! Thanks mellow mushroom for the vegan options!! Just get better vegan cheese please :)"}
{"text":"I should preface this review, by saying I'm very biased, there are Mellow Mushrooms all over my home state of Georgia, and they were the setting for many great culinary, live music and standard debauchery experiences for me.  Fresh ingredients, good draft selection....I recommend the Kosmic Karma.  The shroom on Mill is way too nice and clean though."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to coming here. But unfortunately the service was a total let down! Came in at 930pm on 6/17 and was greeted by a host that obviously needs to be trained on how to do a his job. He was asking every customer if they wanted booth, outside, or table. (In a very timid and awkward way) When he go to us he was about to give us the same spiel, but we went ahead and said booth. And he was all awkward,and laughed, and handed the menus to the hostess who took us to our table. No \"thank you for coming\", no \"how many people today\", and definitely no \"how are you doing tonight\".

So we waited and chatted for a bit and couldn't help but notice that all the tables around us were dirty and needed to be bussed.  And as we waited, we witnessed several employees just walk by it not even taking notice.  After 20 min of not even getting water or greeted by a server, we decided to walk out. And we knew they knew we were there. We saw several employees looking over at us or helping another table. The place wasn't even half full? We just found this to be utterly unacceptable! 

As we made our way towards the exit, the same host was still at his post. He did not make any eye contact with us or or say anything like \"thank you\" or \"please come back\".

Overall, I am sure the food is fantastic here.  But we were not able to taste or purchase anything due to the lack of service here. In my opinion, that host should either be fired or put into a different position. And the staff needs to be trained to treat customers with importance and have a since of urgency."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Walked in and the young black lady behind the host stand was anything but kind. 
She interrupted me not once but twice. I had two questions for her and she answered both with an attitude. No sense of service. Walked out the door. If this is who they have at the front I would hate to sit down and eat there. I have eaten at the other mellow mushroom . Great service great food. 
Here , poor service didn't even bother to sit down ."}
{"text":"Kidding me with the 3.5 star average.

The best pizza north of the 101 loop. Fantastic happy hour specials, great service, and delicious pizza.

Came here for a birthday party, we got 4 different pizzas and they were all fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food everything is fresh. Nothing is made before you order. Absolutely the best in town. Staff is great and friendly. Food comes out hot and delicious. You can't go wrong. Anthony is the best server around. Highly recommend the food and the service"}
{"text":"Hubby and I were on our way to an Escape Room and needed a place to eat.  We had a Groupon for this place so we decided to use it last night.  For a Friday night, we were surprised they were pretty empty.  We were seated right away and the waitress came to take our order.  They have an extensive selection of beers and we both decided to order one.  They were good although I felt that they could have been a little colder. We decided to start off with a small Enlightened Spinach salad to share. It had fresh spinach topped with chopped apples, dried cherries, and sprinkled with candied pecans and feta cheese. We also chose to add on chicken. The dressing the waitress suggested for it was their signature Esperanza. At first bite it felt like the wrong type of dressing for this type of salad; however, after a few bites the flavors began to meld together and it became quite tasty.  We couldn't decide on which pizza to share so the waitress suggested we do half and half which is what we did.  Our favorite was the Kosmic Karma.  It had a base of red sauce with spinach, sun-dried tomatoes, sliced Roma tomatoes, and finished with both mozzarella and feta cheese. The pesto swirl they finished it with really set it off. For our other half we chose the Funky Q. Chicken. It was covered with BBQ chicken, mozzarella and cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and Applewood smoked bacon then finished with a BBQ sauce swirl. It was good however I felt that the Applewood smoked bacon overpowered the other flavors. Service was fine and the waitress made sure to check on us regularly. Hubby and I agreed that the food was okay but it is not a place we would go out of our way to visit again."}
{"text":"Being in the Charlotte area for only 9 mos, we heard raves about Mellow Mushroom, and now happy to be able to experience for ourselves!  I would have to say you can't compare it to your regular pizza joint, to me it's apples and oranges. I liked the pizza because it was different and the molasses in the dough gives it the unique texture/taste. It was crispy thin in the middle with a thick crust on the outside. I had the Philosopher's pie and my husband had his own with pepperoni and mushroom. We also had the tortilla soup and the stuffed portabello mushroom for an appetizer, both were excellent! Another plus was the long list of beers on tap. Decor inside was fun. The only complaint (well not really a complaint) is that we dropped $50 on lunch for 2. I guess its on par since it's more like a gourmet pizza place.

We went during lunch and at around 12:30 there was no wait (it was a really early lunch for us!)."}
{"text":"good food - over priced fancy pizza (sometimes too soggy)
great beer and always ice cold
way way way to overpriced 
the staff always suck
slow or on their phones to much
only would come here when thats where the group wants to go"}
{"text":"I was visiting my son in Tempe and he took me here. The pizza was good, and the service (Alex) was good, however, I ordered a 16oz draft beer and my son ordered a 12oz can of beer. Both came in the same sized glass and were full to the top, so obviously, the glass was only 12oz. I questioned the server who went to his manager. When Alex came back he told us that the manager told him \"thats how we always do it. you are paying the same price as the 12oz so don't worry about it.\" That is not ok. That constitutes fraud and if i would have only paid for half of the pizza because that was all we ate, would they have been ok with that? My son was more upset about this than i was and has vowed never to return with his friends. I will not be back either.
Next time you order a beer, make sure you get what you ask for."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is one of my favorite pizza chains!

I have been to this location a few times while visiting Phoenix on business. The service is always super friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is fun and almost Brewery-esque. I had a super good Stone IPA on limited tap. 

The menu is large with all your favorite Italian bites for appetizers AND A TON OF VEGAN OPTIONS!! But really this place is all about the pizza. The crust is just so damn good. It's a little crispy on the outside and flight and fluffy on the inside. It's kinda making my mouth water right thinking about it. They offer daiya cheese, which is lovely, but I usually just opt for no cheese. Last time I went I got a calzone and it was perfect. All vegan. Yesss!

Mellow Mushroom, you make my vegan heart happy! Keep doing what you do!"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is a chain that has locations mostly in college towns.  I ate at the one in Boone, NC first.  I thought the pizza was good, but a bit over priced, but they have a very good craft beer selection.  So I gave the one in Tempe a try.

I travel into Phoenix for business fairly regularly and eat at the Mushroom on almost every trip because the bartenders - Ariana and Katie - are friendly and efficient.  Get there before 6 for happy hour specials.  Order a medium pizza or larger and take the leftovers home.  They also have reverse happy hour after 10:00pm.

My favorite pizza is not one of their specials, but is should be: red sauce, spinach, mushrooms and caramelized onions.  They should add it to the menu as it works great with their medium crust"}
{"text":"The patio area here is amazing. Those Misters are refreshing and the grateful dead drink was delish. Crust was some of the best I've had, toppings plentiful and the whole pie was perfect."}
{"text":"You know it's bad when the leftovers don't get eaten.
Actually, I didn't HATE the pizza. It was meh for me. The dough had a moist, dense, chewy texture, which I didn't mind but my husband and son were wishing we'd gone to Oreganos (actually, they would've preferred Pizza Hut for those prices!)

Tried the Mellowterranean pizza which was quite bland with very few toppings and the turkey & cheese hoagie on rye pretzel bread (completely devoid of flavor--how hard is it to offer mustard or mayo?)

The \"pretzels\" are just pizza dough twisted into pretzel shapes. Since they were hot and salty, I'd have to say that was the highlight of the meal.

Ambience is nothing special; don't quite understand the movie theatre theme as it's really only the entry area. The large booths are nice the back seating area is wide open to the kitchen, which can provide entertainment in the form of swirling pizzas and tossed dough but it also means we see that pimpled teens are cooking the food and not really caring if the dough hits the ceiling. Yikes.

A Groupon enticed us to try it but nothing will likely get us to go back I'm afraid...."}
{"text":"First off, Gabriella was great. She was very attentive and the food was great, as always. We are moving out of town and had a Groupon to use. We had separate checks and were both planning on using a Groupon. As we gave the Groupon with our check, we were told that we could only use one per table, not one per check. We are moving out of town, so we will not be able to use this Groupon again. The manager was adamant that we could not use the Groupon, even though we have no opportunity to use it in the future. We came here to use the Groupon. There are times when an exception is valid. This restaurant is not in the \"service\" industry. Maybe I'm wrong, but I am very disappointed with the level of appreciation this restaurant has for its customers. A $10 investment in a good review or an extra $10 profit to lose our business and our friends' business for life. Treat your customers well, they'll be back."}
{"text":"Worst mellow mushroom out of all of them. If you go there expecting to use a coupon, dont. I go there and when arriving I say I have a coupon for a certain food with their ap and they say okay just show us at the end. I didn't have much money to spend so me and a few friends just came to get a few drinks and decided to use coupon. On checking out they said I needed to spend $20 to use it which was fine, I get another drink to make it just above $20 and honestly I didn't really want the drink but no worries. I said can I pay out now and since it Litterally just turned midnight is was now expired. It was 12:03. I said can I get my money back for the drink then and they said it was my fault for saying I had a Groupon, which I never even said. I didn't even know what a Groupon was. So I had to spend an extra $12 for stuff I didn't even want. I used to go here at least 3 times a week. 

The first time this happened I had a gift card but you had to spend $20 I was at $18 so I said can I get another drink to make it $20+ to use coupon. And then they said no I was cutt off. RIDICULOUS!!! I bought drinks for other people and wasn't even close to drunk. They look like they have new pepole since this happened but I avoid this location  as much as possible. Happy valley is much much better and actually has the beers on the menu rather than wet pieces of paper"}
{"text":"Great service, good food, great beer selection. We went on a Friday night with family. We were expecting a long wait, which for inside was about 45 minutes. We decided to go outside and they sat us right away. Even though it was 100+ outside that day the patio wasn't too bad actually. Misters and shades along the side helped a lot. We had a great server and the manager came around filling waters throughout the night. Great service!
The food was tasty. We ordered wings which were very good but a bit mild for being called \"hot wings\". My hubby had a small pizza which he was only able to eat 3 slices of and it was out of this world. It was the meat specialty they have on the menu and it was great!! My son had a half sandwhich and chips... the sandwhich was HUGE even for being a half portion. He ate the overflowing amounts of bacon out of it mostly when he was full... we'd never seen so much bacon fit on a sandwhich! I ordered the veggie calzone, it was alright. I don't think I'll order it again though, seeing how everything else was so good... and the calzone was just average I'd say.
Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"My take out experience was great. Nice bar tender, reasonably priced small but satisfactory wine selection ( hey, it's a pizza place and not Morton's) and fast service and my pizza looked and tasted good!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Mellow Mushroom for a couple years now and have enjoyed it but the service has slowly turned me away. I decided to give it one last tonight and I ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT, be returning. I called in an order for two medium pizzas yesterday night, which upon arrival my friend and I realized they messed up one of the pies. Sadly I filled out the check and left a tip before realizing the mistake. The nice server apologized and explained the TO-GO girl wrote down \"no chicken\" but didn't put it on the order ticket. The server kept apologizing  and said we could keep the messed up pizza. The manager then came up to us at the bar where we were waiting and apologized. He told us that the pizza would be out in 10 minutes and then took away the pizza that the server told us we could keep. After 20 minutes of waiting at the bar our other pizza was cold and we hadn't even been offered water.  We finally got the pizza, and what bothered me the most is they couldn't even give us a discount or follow up with their word for letting us keep the pizza. I paid $50 dollars for a 20 minute wait, a cold pizza, and an under cooked pizza. We got back to my friends house and realized the pizza they remade was still doughy and undercooked. The manager at that location is one of the reasons why I have stopped coming, I've had encounters with him where he was just so rude. He's not a friendly person at all.
Another thing that rubs me the wrong way is the way the management responds to their bad Yelps. They give a simple \"Sorry for your bad experience, hope you give us another try!\" Or \"We'll talk to our waiting staff about this\" which in this case the only waiting staff we encountered yesterday the very polite server. In EVERY restaurant I've worked at if we got a bad Yelp review we'd respond with an offer of a free entree or free dessert or free drinks at the bar (if they didn't enjoy our beer). I get the impression that Mellow Mushroom is just cheap. They do absolutely nothing to try to make things right when they mess up, and that leaves a sour taste in my mouth. They don't seem to care about what their customers think. I will NOT be giving Mellow Mushroom another try, I'll stick to Pita Jungle. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great delicious pizza and fast service. Great drink options due to full bar. Great place to bring visitors on a hot day."}
{"text":"YES! YES! YES!  I am so happy to have gone back to the Shroom the other day.  I was hesitant.   My first review of the Shroom here in AZ back in June 2012 was pretty bad.  2 stars.   It pained me to leave one of my all-time favorite Atlanta originals a 2 star scathing review.

The Shroom here in AZ has it dialed in.  It is as good as I remember from growing up in Atlanta.  The yummy whole wheat crust is awesome.  Baked on the stone.  My mouth is watering just typing up this review.

I have to admit that I love having a server that is passionate about something and it shows.  Our server assisted me in selecting the perfect beer for me.  Having 50 beers on tap to choose from makes selecting the perfect beer hit or miss without a aficionado. 

As my man Schwarzenegger says, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"I love the mellow mushroom in Tempe. My parents live up north and my dad wanted pizza for his birthday. Ordered one pizza at 515 when I showed up over an hour later they told me that it hadn't even been made yet with no apology and that I would need to wait another 15 minutes. Unimpressed."}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe and I'd give the food a solid 3.5 stars.  We ordered the house salad.  It was enough for my honey and I to share.  We also ordered the wings (hot).  They were more like medium but loved the taste. Great appetizer.  The finally was the pizza.  My only complaint is that it was delivered with Parmesan already sprinkled all over it and I'm not a big fan.  The service was superior.   I'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"We came back here cause we were in the area and my girlfriend was craving a orange blossom beer. That beer is so good and its local. This time I ordered the steak sandwich. I was surprised it was very good. Beef was sliced really thin and it was on a great soft and crunchy roll. I will say it could have used a little more meat and less lettuce but the flavor was there. My girlfriend got the Hawaiian pizza. I'm not a fan of the crust here but the Hawaiian pizza actually goes well with the sweet crust they have here. The menu is pizza, sandwiches and salads. They need a few pasta dishes on here in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is another restaurant we are adding to the list of places that we will only visit for happy hour.  My hubby and I ordered a greek salad to split and created our own pizza.  We got four toppings on it.  The beer selection is good, but each beer is $7!!  Once again, there must be gold dust in the beers served in the Northwest valley because $7 for a  beer is outrageous.  The pizza was pretty good, but when the bill came, we noticed that each vegetable topping was 1.29 a piece and each meat topping was 2.29 a piece.  For 1.29 worth of onions, we should have had 1/2 of an onion on that pizza.  Instead, I could barely find any onion.  They were beyond stingy with the toppings!  You're making me pay a ton per topping and I can barely see that it's on the pizza.  Not a fan of that at all!  We will not be returning unless it's happy hour and we will never order a pizza there again because it was way overpriced for the measly toppings they put on it."}
{"text":"Love the beer selection and happy hour....also love the fact they take groupon for Happy hour...best beer and deal in town! !"}
{"text":"The food was really good but incredibly high priced! I ordered a gluten free veggie pizza. The price wasn't on the menu so imagine my surprise when the bill came out and it was $18.00!"}
{"text":"Slightly better than dominos/pizza hut/little Caesars but the price doesn't pay for quality and amount of pizza. Save your money instead for another pizza place. Seriously 20 bucks for a medium sized pizza?"}
{"text":"I have ended up a regular here for lunch. Love the salads, the sandwiches and the Caesar Pizza is a guilty pleasure!! The tangerine/strawberry black ice tea is refreshing and they always give me a togo cup when I leave. :) (its the little things that count!)

Nice place to chill have a beer and some fresh food. I was surprised at the beer selection I really wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised! 

 I enjoy the staff and have always gotten good service.  and YUP.... I'll be back! ;)"}
{"text":"We have never been here and we were greeted and seated promptly. We had an amazingly energetic waitress that was full of enthusiasm about her product and her passion for pizza.  Carol was a ten!  We ordered a salad which was very good and then Our pizza came.  Looked and smelled yummy.  My wife took a couple of bites as well as myself and it was great.  I then discovered a hair in my slice of the pizza.  We told our waitress and she took it away right away and was super apologetic including the lady who appeared to be the manager!  We get it and understand that stuff happens and were dissaponted and still hungry!  The two cooks in the kitchen thought it to be funny?  We felt like a spectacle that we would be so bold to return pizza with hair in it.  The cooks kept staring at us as if we had committed some crime. So not only was our first ever visit to the restaurant unappetizing but the attitude of the staff became suspect once the pizza was returned!  The cook that thought it was funny should be reprimanded and shouldn't be in the people business with that attitude.  Bottom line I won't eat any type of food with human hair in it and will certainly not return to this place."}
{"text":"just like all the rest if the Mellow Mushroom's, very good food and service.  nice big location uptown next to the new baseball stadium.  great beer menu"}
{"text":"Review is not based off the food. Service here is absolutely terrible called to place an order for a pizza and salad before 12pm and told me it would be 20 minutes. Showed up and was told the person who took my order never placed it. So I was asked if I wanted to wait and at this point I'm already here so why not. Order was placed and all I got was a sorry when she handed me the bill with no real look in the eye no offer to try and make it better from there. Have had terrible service when I've been in the restaurant before but thought I would give it another chance not after this. I work in the customer service industry and usually when the company makes a mistake they try to do what they can in their power to make it better. I could have gotten more than a poor sorry. Also when I finally did get my pizza no one said anything they just put the order next to me and walked away... Wow lol could not be worse"}
{"text":"Mello mushroom is a pshycadelic trip to 1970.   Take some acid and try some crazy pizza.  All kidding aside this place is a good alternative to regular boring pizza.  Probably not a go to but a definite once a month.  
The one appetizer we had was baked wings.  Nothing to write home about.  Salads were very boring and very tasteless.  But the Pizza.   The pizza was very good.  Dough is wheat, molasses and spring water. They use corn meal not flour to toss.  It's a solid 7 out of 10."}
{"text":"After the movies we three couples decided to have dinner here. I was craving their mushroom soup which I have had before. It's a wonderful creamy delicious mushroom soup.
So when it was time for my order I was told they only had the spicey tortilla soup tonight.
What a disappointment, not to have their signature menu item to serve!
My dining mates ordered pizza, all three different varieties.  Two couples loved their pizza, one couple said they have had better.
The menu has a great variety of appetizers,  pizza, sandwiches, soup, salads and pasta etc.. Prices reasonable.
Pizza came out hot. All looked great. Nice presentation on the pizza stand.
Sauce, cheese, toppings , crust all fresh very tasty for us.
Our waiter was friendly and attentive,  the atmosphere was comfortable.
Really hope they have the mushroom soup available next time."}
{"text":"Pizza was just average, and a little more pricey than I think they warrant.  Lots of toppings, and creative solutions, but no combinations that really stood out as something I wanted to actually try. so we got a meaty style. salads were ok. Service was average, and there were not that many people to serve. the drinks were pretty cheap (wine, beer, margs) but I don't think they had any Coors or Bud on tap, which is unusual.  I really love pizza, but I probably would not return here."}
{"text":"My wife and I have driven past The Mellow Mushroom several times and commented on how we would like to try it sometime. Today we recieved a mailer coupon, on my birthday may I add, we decided to stop in for dinner....big mistake. The time was 6:30 and there was a long waiting list to be seated. As it turns out there was no one on the patio but it was open for immediate seating so my wife and kids and I chose to \"skip\" the wait and take a table outside. Little did we know that this meant that we would receive no service. 15 minutes after being seated the hostess came to our table and took our drink order, which on a busy night is tolerable. The service only went downhill from there. It took us another 15 minutes to get a waitress. We were interested in ordering the bruschetta appetizer and asked the waitress how many came on the platter and were told 8. When the appetizer arrived there were only 5 pieces and no apology from the waitress as to her misinformation. What kind of waitress has no idea as to what the details of the menu are?? This is a three page menu of pizza/bar food...not that hard to memorize. We finished our appetizer, which was pretty tasty only to wait another 20 mins for our pizza. By this time our drinks were empty and we were clearly dissappointed with the level of service. The hostess again had to help us out with drink refills. Nothing great about the pizza  when it arrived which was even more dissappointing. Then came the bill which took another extended period to be processed. The coupon we had wasn't even valid until 8/23 and the staff chose not to honor it. What?!? After the fact that the food is marginal at best and the worst service for such a popular place, we will not be returning and making sure that we sway all of our friends against this place."}
{"text":"We went here with a Groupon and it was such a good deal! $10 for $20. The place is really big and clean and had cute decor. We ordered the garlic bread first and it was ok, nothing special. We then ordered the wings and expected them to be crispy since they are called \"crispy oven wings\" but unfortunately they were mushy but still had a good taste. We got speciality pizzas and even tried the gluten free crust which is probably the best we have ever had! The Kosmic Karma and Mighty Meaty were very good. The only downfall is they are pretty expensive but wasn't too bad with the Groupon. Definitely a good place to try but not sure if it is going to become one of our \"usual\" places."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza place in AZ  The crust  is super. The Thai pizza is yummy. I liked the pretzel bites and cheese bread. They have a happy hour with half price appetizers and beer.   I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Boring food and not so interesting decor. This was one of the worst pizzas I have had. I don't know how they stay in business. Even the salad was mediocre."}
{"text":"Half price Happy Hour- no wonder it's always packed in the bar area- attracting all the lovely milfs from Norterra and they huzzbins. 

As the name suggests, anything with mushrooms will make you mellow and be delicious, too. I am not the biggest fan of the pretzels. They're just not what I expect when pretzels come to mind- don't taste at all like the pretzels you get at a WaWa which is pretty much my baseline for pretzels. The hummus was excellent and so are the wings. The beer selection is really good and if you've never had Maui Coconut Porter in a can, don't sleep on it!

If I lived closer, I'd make myself a regular."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for late night happy hour! This seems to be one of the only places in the area that is open until 2am, every night of the week! Working late some nights so this is the perfect place to stop into on the way home. They have a large selection of beer on draft that seems to be changing frequently! The bartenders are always very friendly and attentive! I've tried a pear martini that's very delicious but I usually stick to \"my usual\". A gin martini with cucumber, simple syrup and lemon! Sooo refreshing! As far as food goes...I haven't tried anything I didn't like! The combo pizza is sooo good, even reheated the next day! Tons of toppings and the perfect amount of cheese! The dough is made fresh and always tastes so light and fluffy! I'm usually someone who stops once I  hit the crust, so this is saying something. Only problem with the pizza, it's not on their happy hour menu :( The pretzels with cheese are very good, too! I believe they're made from the same dough as the pizza. The cheese is thick and very flavorful! You get a very large portion of pretzels for the happy hour price! Can't go wrong! The meatballs are massive! It comes with 3 and a very tasty marinara sauce! Definitely something that will fill your belly! Now for the grand finale...my favorite...the wings!!! Oh my gosh! I crave these daily! I always get the Thai sauce. A little spicy but too good to turn down. The full size has 10 wings and I eat every one of them, every time! They are so juicy and flavorful! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try Mellow Mushroom last night after hearing my friends recommend it - I'm a pizza fanatic. Overall, I had a good experience and will go back.

Atmosphere: This place was more casual that I expected, and you walk in to a trippy, psychedelic / 60s music theme, as you can see from my photos. I found the restaurant to be very clean, which I appreciate. And you can watch them making pizzas behind the counter.

Service: Our server was very perky and pleasant. While she started out fairly attentive, I started wondering where she was while we waited for drink refills and eventually our bill as the night went on. It was pretty empty there and the pizza took about half an hour - although she did warn us about the typical pizza wait when we sat down. This isn't unusual for handmade specialty pizzas, just don't go if you're ravenous and can't tolerate a wait. And that wait will easily double if there's a crowd. I think competitor Dewey's is faster.

Menu and pricing: The menu selection has a good variety of tasty-sounding appetizers, salads, pizzas, calzones and hoagies. We had trouble deciding what to order! And while I've seen some review complaints on pricing, it was in line with what I'd expect from a handmade specialty pizza restaurant. Id say prices were pretty on par when compared again with Dewey's, until you get to the large pizza size, which was a bit higher. The beer was priced reasonably at about $5, and they had a good seasonal selection available.

Food quality: My salad was just OK - I'll forgo next time, I didn't enjoy the handmade ranch. Dewey's wins out there. As for pizza, we got a large split into two flavors - the Funky Q. Chicken (BBQ chicken, bacon, caramelized onions, mozzarella & cheddar, and red sauce) and the Thai Dye (curry chicken, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, olive oil and garlic, mozzarella and Thai chili sauce). The crust was absolutely the best part - I found it to be fantastically delicious, thick, and both crunchy and fluffy, better than Dewey's. The pizzas had plenty of toppings, they weren't stingy - lots of cheese, and big meat chunks!

The BBQ chicken pizza was just ok though - too much soggy onion piled into it for my tastes, and the bacon was chewy and just meh. Ditto the BBQ sauce. I very much prefer Dewey's version.

However I really enjoyed the Thai Curry pizza, it had a great, traditional curry flavor and was very saucy. I would eat again!

I'd like to go back to try a couple more menu options, like the Mighty Meaty, calzones and pretzel appetizer. And it's worth mentioning that the friend I was with said their Holy Shitake Pie is the best pizza he's ever had (we didn't order bc I don't like mushrooms). 

Overall, a good place to pop into when you want to spend more for a specialty pizza and have time to spend waiting with good company!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Mesa!!! Logan takes such good care of me and my best friend and we will be here for years to come. The happy hour is fantastic and he always gives us quick and friendly service!! Thank you Logan your rock."}
{"text":"I have tried 3x to swallow the MM Kool-Aid and I was disappointed all 3x.  Pizza was overdone, crust hard as anything and was mediocre at best. Not ever going back."}
{"text":"I wish zero stars was an option. Our 35 minute wait turned into a 55 minute wait and my name was still never called. I went back to hostess and she said she called my name and I wasn't paying attention and I must not have heard it. She must have been whispering cause I was paying pretty close attention. It's gonna take a lot of convincing to ever go back there again."}
{"text":"I can't even comment on the food they serve here. Reason being, there was no food to be served. Arrived at the restaurant, never was greeted but only to sit down next to the bar. No problem with that, except no one even tried to acknowledge us. Sat unwaited for about 15 mins, being clearly visible to the wait staff. Left disappointed and clearly upset with the unprofessionalism and discern of the staff at mellow mushroom. I should give them 0 stars but you can't. Never tasted the food and staff was rude. Disappointed customer!!"}
{"text":"Second time coming here. First time was great, but the second time around the service was absolutely terrible. My order never ended up coming out, the waiter never came by to check up on us, and we had to go up to the bar(after waiting for a few minutes to even get someone's attention!) to ask for the checks! Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Excellent menu (both food and beverages). Unique pizza crust making this a great place to get good pizza that's out of the ordinary but very tasty. Great tasting beers as well.  Service was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a pizza lunch in the Norterra Plaza area of north Phoenix - just north of the Deer Valley airport.  Couldn't find the intended target but Mellow Mushroom has a very visible sign that lured me in.  

They have a large rectangular dining area with a bar off to the side on the end.  Outdoor patio seating wraps two sides.  Lots of hard environmental surfaces makes for a noisy dining space.  There were lots of kids with parents contributing to the noise.  This isn't a place that would appeal to kids other than the food.  

I ordered a lunch Greek salad and personal pizza with cheese, sausage and caramelized onion.  Turns out the lunch salad would have been plenty.  Salad was very good and included a piece of garlic butter cheese toasted baguette - a tasty and nice touch.  

The cheese, sausage and caramelized onion pizza had crust that was medium thick crunchy outside with a soft chewee center.  It was a bit oily, but pizza is not really a health food.  Somehow, pepperoni was added also.  I love pepperoni but it no longer loves me.  Wish they had not put the pepperoni on but I ate it all anyway.  That's why I stay away from addictive drugs - no way I would ever stop once started.  

Overall Mellow Mushroom provided a noisy, filling and tasty meal even if slightly different than I ordered.   

They will stay in my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"This location of Mellow Mushroom is banned from my list of restaurants. I have dined there four times and had consistent bad experiences.

When the restaurant is busy, the wait staff becomes overwhelmed and the kitchen cannot keep up.  This happened three of the four times I ate there.

On my last visit, it was a Saturday night and we arrived at 9:30. The restaurant was swamped. There was a live band playing and the music was loud. This was my son's birthday dinner.  The service was slow.  Our waiter had too many tables.  The kitchen was backed up.  My son ordered his own pizza.  Someone dropped it on the floor in the kitchen and it had to be remade.  I can understand that.  However, the service from our waiter became worse and worse.  He frankly did not seem to care.  Another waiter began helping us for a while which was good.  In the end, we left after two hours."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? Awesome food, great variety for everyone to find something on the menu, a beer selection to die for and service always rocks!"}
{"text":"Love the place!!!! We ate at the one in Greenville, SC, Orlando, Fl, Pigeon Forge, Tn, and now Rocky River, Oh. They are all consistent and great.

{"text":"I went here with some work friends and was surprised at the nice atmosphere of the place. We sat outside, and I brought my 7 year old with me. The soft pretzel was delicious, the service was great, and the crowd was cool. It's a little too 'chainey' for me, but I would definitely go back if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I recently went here for the first time after hearing lots of good reviews and reccommendations. I am pregnant, and unfortunately could not enjoy anything of of their fantastic beer list, however, I will be coming back for that. When I do come back though, it will be during happy hour as it is expensive for a beer! I tried a pepperoni calzone and buffalo chicken pizza. The calzone was pretty good but the pizza was not! I love the buffalo chick pizza at Oggi's and I just don't know if anything else can live up to that. However, their dough was fantastic and there were a lot of other pizzas on the menu that looked good so we plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Loud atmosphere, very loud.  Pizza is good but crust is very tough almost uncuttable. Large 8 slice $25.00 plus. On the Pizza scale I would give it 7 out of 10.  Danny Boys Pizza bare none is amazing. Also pricey but worth it. Actually eating a small 3 item to go as i write this, it was $12.00 and some change. Five stars *****"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places! Always something for me and my boyfriend to compromise on. Plus, great selection of beer, good service & good atmosphere for date night."}
{"text":"Went to this location 8 months ago and had a bad experience.  Left a bad yelp review and was given a $25 gift card.  Definitely appreciate the gesture but went back last night and used the gift card on some beer and then got food to go.  Got home and opened up the food and the orders were all messed up.  Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me.  I should have known better lol."}
{"text":"We came here and was excited to try this new place. The \"bro\". Who was our waiter walked passed us 3-4 times and didn't even acknowledge us or take our drinks.. I said f this and left. Pretty piss..  so a few weeks I figured I would give this place another try. Thank god our waitress was on top of things and was very sweet and had a very pleasant smile  and the food turned out pretty good!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza- I had the Gluten Free Margarita Pizza with a pesto oil added. It was wonderful- which is not always the case with GF pizza. Environment is good- but have Pizza here and then get drinks at one of the outdoor bars around the corner."}
{"text":"Food was good! Waitress was awesome Lorena was her name she was on top of everything! Drinks kept coming food came quick and she was cheerful and took care of everything for us!"}
{"text":"Anthony, our server, was and is the shizz. He was everything a service ambassador should be, attentive, knowledgeable of the menu, and a bright and engaging conversationalist. Dude is awesome.

It was already a great day. We were there celebrating my son's promotion at work. It was not particularly busy, and my son and Anthony got in an incredibly detailed and analytical discussion about the pending NBA season. It was gripping entertainment to my wife and me.

Tasty food:  Killer wings, Awesome Pizza, Cold crisp salad... pretty good Cheesesteak. Note to Mellow Mushroom: Cheesesteaks are supposed to be a bit greasy... and the cheese is supposed to be melted throughout.

Great time, clean, great atmosphere, tasty food, amazing staff... Anthony Anthony Anthony.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Just okay. Pizza was neither bad nor fantastic. Ordered hummus appetizer, was also okay. Peach tea was yummy. I would rather eat at Oreganos than here, especially since lunch came to $36 for 2 people which included a medium pizza, hummus and one drink, I had water. I'll come back sometime, perhaps."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and I was SO disappointed! The waiter was plain rude and disrespectful. He was bothered anytime I asked a question about the menu and even got so bad he started arguing loudly with me over the price of a beer. It was happy hour and didn't want to change the price of a beer to what it should have been. Will never come again. Don't bother wasting your time on this place."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon, we found this place.  It's located in North Phoenix, tucked away in a small complex with condos and a few stores....no way we would have stumbled upon this place if it wasn't for Groupon.  It's located on \"High St\".....LMAO (if you don't get it, you never will)

The decor of the place reminds me of Scooby Doo....must be the 70's \"groovy\" Mushroom style.  I like it.

During our two visits here, we tried:

House Special (Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, Ham, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Mushrooms, Black Olives, Roma Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Onions, topped w/extra Mozzarella), $26.95

Mighty Meaty (Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, Ham & Applewood Smoked Bacon), $25.89

The House Special was a bit too much for me.  There's too many toppings on the Pizza.  I like my Pizza well done, which is what we ordered, but because it has a ton of toppings, the Pizza was still very wet & soggy.  The flavors of the toppings clashed with each other....too much to handle in my opinion.

The Mighty Meaty is much better.  The flavor of each of the Meats stands out and tastes well together.  It's a much better Pizza than the House Special if you like your Pizza well done.

The service here was hit/miss.  One visit, it was outstanding....the next visit, it was a little slow and we had to wave down our server.

If it was closer to our house, we'd probably visit more often.

{"text":"love this place great food, friendly helpful serves, strong drinks 48 craft beers on draft and, great happy hour 3-6 and reverse  happy hour 10 - 2."}
{"text":"Really great happy hour!  Great groupon I really suggest especially if its your first time just to get you motivated to try! Definitely recommend the pizza and all the appitizers are delicious especially their cheese sauce fot the pretzels (that you want to dip EVERYTHING in)! All speciality drinks  are half off! Not just well drinks and the crappy stuff. 2 thumbs up for me!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's just this location or what, but they put fewer toppings on their pizza than dominos or papa johns but charge 4 times as much!  It's an embarrassment to pizza and a complete ripoff.  This is not from one experience, but multiple.  To top it off (no pun intended), they rarely make my order correctly and it's a long wait even when there are no other patrons in the place.  If you're in the Desert Ridge area go to Midici.  You'll get a pizza loaded with toppings, tastes better, ready in just a few minutes, and at 1/3 if the price."}
{"text":"First time in, and we were mortified by what we experienced. After waiting to be seated we finally got a table in the bar hightop area. Server was quite prompt but that was where it all went downhill. Had I lacked situational awareness I may not have noticed that all staff was un-showered and sloppy in service. The bartenders in plain sight had their greasy hair down, eating their lunch licking their dirty fingers right in front of clientele. The \"manager\" was quite dumpy with a unprofessional demeanor. Other staff ignored empty cluttered tables, as diners were left to stare at the abandoned food about. The floor was covered in trash, the pizza was uncut and to be quite frank the whole restaurant and its staff seemed to be incompetent unwelcoming and unapologetic. Will never return."}
{"text":"Good place for specialty pizza. Service as quick and waitress was able to give good suggestions."}
{"text":"Good and predictable.    What I expect from a good chain restaurant."}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza is AMAZING!!! We went in the mid afternoon and it was chill and calm. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are amazing. But the service along with silverware and the plates are  terrible!!! Servers are way too casual and often look dirty...I get it, that's part of the theme but it just doesn't feel right. It feels dirty. The tables are usually wet when you sit down because they were wiped down with a nasty soaked towel. Oh well I love the food so I will go back but it's kind of pricey for the service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Om-a-nom-a-nom-a-nom

Food was good and the service was great.  Very relaxed and laid back atmosphere.  I was there at the tail end of the lunch rush during a week day with some out of town friends.  Had a calzone that was piping hot and delicious!  I'll definitely be back to try their pizza."}
{"text":"Bartender has serious anger management issues. Absolutely appalling management. First the bartender started yelling his head off at our friend who simply pointed out that they had his card and that we were being served at the tables just by the bar. Then the manager came along and absolutely failed at managing. Didn't get the bartender to apologize and instead called in the bouncer and threatened to call the cops in on the entire party for imaginary reasons. Clearly they were all having a bad day after dealing with an army of ASU students but that still is no excuse for such appalling behavior. Will never go back there again. You would be wise to avoid them on a game night as they clearly cannot handle the stresses of handling a lot of people at once."}
{"text":"The pizza was okay. I'm not into gourmet types of pizzas. I'm more of a Pizza Hut, Dominoes type of guy. So, the pizza wasn't bad. It's just not the type of place I would return for pizza."}
{"text":"Alice in wonderland meets pizza. Its a fun \"trip\", for adults and children. Note this since you will see and hear a generous amount of families and other patrons. Great rotation of beers on tap and great family atmosphere. I give them credit for creative pizzas and the ability to properly execute their creativity. There aren't many restaurants out of the chain that I can say the same thing about in Charlotte. If you want something out of the norm this is definitely worth the experience. Your second visit, make it a point to try the pretzels as this is the same dough they use for their pizzas! Greek salad is refreshing."}
{"text":"I was surprised to see so many medium-to-negative reviews about this place. My wife and I went last Thursday night and we were incredibly impressed.

Mellow Mushroom is a dine-in restaurant, so it is a little pricey. But it's easy for two people to share a medium pizza and an appetizer and get out for less than $30, which is pretty average for your typical dine-in experience. There is a bit of sticker shock if you order carry out (three pizzas and two appetizers to go can run you $75)

But, having said that, it's worth it. I've been on a quest to find the best pizza in Phoenix and upon first bite Mellow Mushroom was easily in my top three. Their hand-made pretzels are fantastic (try the Garlic Parmesan) and the pizza is most excellent-- I get what I always get to test the water, pepperoni and mushroom, and I was very impressed.

The atmosphere is pretty cool too. Unless you were a sheltered child, you can probably tell that this is a hippie themed kind of place with hints of stoner undertones. Say what you want about that lifestyle, but potheads know their pizza. Our server, Chris, was very friendly and was happy to tell us all about the company history--which is a fun story too.

We tried it on a whim, and we had a great experience. I highly recommend giving it a shot if you're a fan of pizza. Their half-white-half-wheat dough makes a really interesting flavor and the texture is slightly chewy yet crunchy on the bottom, it's excellent.

They also have a promo right now, if you go in there and get one of their business cards, you can bring it back between 2/15/10 and 2/28/10 for a random prize--drinks, pizza, etc.

Bottom line: I loved it."}
{"text":"Hit up the much-anticipated (at least by me) Mellow Mushroom last night and was not disappointed.

Highlights:
1. Tasty Pizza - plenty of veg options and crispy, seasoned crust.
2. Fantastic beer selection - includes local faves and my absolute favorite (Rogue Hazelnut Brown Ale) on tap.
3. Large space - no waiting for a table, and I don't HAVE to smash toe to toe with the bros.

Unfortunate aspects:
1. Most 16 oz beers on tap are $6 (six!!!?) and it's a buck more for 20 oz. That's pretty steep in my book, even for Mill Ave. Thank the Good Dude that Happy Hour starts at 10pm and we got our half price :)
2. Portions seemed OK, but I was a little surprised by the price point. Probably a bit too expensive for me to be a regular... the three of us had a hummus, 6 beers (@ $3.50 happy hour prices), and a Med (14\") Pizza and the tab came out at almost $50. That's a little more than I like to spend on a weeknight for pizza and beer. And if it was not happy hour I would certainly not be happy paying $7 for a beer.

All in all, I really dug the atmosphere, pizza, and beer selection. I would like to see a bit more \"character,\" but it did open two days ago and it has to appeal to tourists. I think it has a lot of potential to succeed in my humble college town. And the late-night hours guarantee that I will make a few drunken stops for pizza, despite any complaints about the price."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. The atmosphere was laid back and so was our waiter. He told us that the pizza is what is the most popular on their menu and to keep that in mind. I wasn't anticipating ordering pizza but after hearing that I did. I liked how they have a gluten free section and that the pricing for the gluten free and non gluten free is the same. That NEVER happens! I was really impressed with that! I also ordered bruschetta as an appetizer and that was just \"o.k.\" .The pizza was really good along with their fruit flavored beer! I can see how this place picks up at night. They have lots of room and the decor is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I came here with few of my co-workers and their family on \"bring your kids to work day\". Kids finished fun visits in our very modern and greenest building in Charlotte. Kids were able to check out the state of the art video conferencing and few little surprises. 

So we came here around 4:30p and even though that place was pretty empty, it took them long time to set everything up. Kids were having fun hanging around water fountain in front of the restaurant. We were called in after twenty five minutes. 

We were seated on patio outside and the waitress took our drink order. Drinks came back in fair amount of time and we were ready to order. We decided what we were going to order as a group and placed the order. Even though the place was pretty empty as I stated earlier, it took them long time to bring few pizza. 

Over all, we enjoyed the atmosphere and the company. Personally, I didn't think the pizza were great. They could also improve on their speed."}
{"text":"Just ordered the Gluten free pizza and it's totally disgusting! Hard and barely even any toppings on it. I even paid for extra cheese and barely got any. I had it at the Scottsdale location and it was sooo good there. I don't know what the deal is with this location. What a waste of money. Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Eh.   Not impressed. 

Heard some glowing reviews on this place and how great it was so was pretty excited to try it because who doesn't love pizza?!  

My pizza was undercooked and dripping with olive oil (not in a good way!)   The only thing going for this place is the crust.... It's pretty good when the pizza is cooked thoroughly to enjoy it. 

Our server was very uninterested in actually being at work, and working in a boring chain place like this I could see why- no real character to the restaurant.  

With so many great places to get a good pizza in the valley... skip the Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, friendly, and attentive. Too bad the pizza was tasteless. The crust is nice and light, made of unbleached white flour. They offer Daiya (vegan) cheese, which is why we went as a family - to accommodate the vegans in the group. Unfortunately, they don't offer a whole wheat or whole grain crust to align with its healthy options.. 

The toppings are meager. A smattering here and there does NOT justify the high price. Sorry, Mellow Mushroom. Nice try, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you are ready for a \"kosmic\" experience, you MUST try the Kosmic Karma pizza at Mellow Mushroom! I am the definition of a carb loving woman, and the thick whole grain crust satisfies every craving I have! Now for the best part - the toppings. My mouth is watering just thinking about the warm mozzarella, the fresh feta and the pesto that form this out of world experience! Wash it all down with a dark stout and you'll be in food lovers paradise! 
The environment is fun and spunky. The graffiti on the walls make for good talking topic (look at the arrow above the kitchen and see what comes to mind!). Being located on Mill Ave in the heart of Downtown Tempe is super convenient and makes this the perfect starting point for a fun night on the town!
On a personal point - the patio is fabulous, however you want to get a table in the back. We have had panhandlers approach us for left over food & money each time we sat too close to the street!"}
{"text":"I have yet  to eat anything there that hasn't been great. I am on a special diet now and the fact that they have gluten free with Vegan options was great. I know that doesn't sound good at all to 90% of the people reading this but it was actually still a really good pizza."}
{"text":"Wow. This pizza is some of the best I've ever tasted, and I've had pizza everywhere; New York, Chicago, even Italy. The crust was amazing, so hardy with crazy flavor I've never experienced in a pizza crust! I had the pizza with a drizzle of pesto and sundried tomatoes, holy moly, it was incredible. I will definitely eat here again, and again (and again)."}
{"text":"Tonight my roommates and I had Ian as a server and he was great! He was so attentive and always had a smile. he made us feel at home and we never wanted to leave! i hope next time i'm back I'm in his section again!"}
{"text":"Such a feast pizza spot! Awesome happy hour (3-6 Monday through Friday half off most appetizers and beer, half off all liquor and wine) and the pizza is awesome. The staff is also really friendly and helpful. We will continue to come here for a great meal!"}
{"text":"$22 for a one topping Pizza, that was burnt black on the bottom. (Didnt discover until got it home). I dont think so"}
{"text":"Just ate as a family at this place and had a terrible experience.  They sat us in the bar area when the entire dining room was pretty much empty, so that the bar tender had to wait on us as well as tend the bar, on a saturday afternoon during March Madness.  Her service was poor:  no water offered, hoagie missing chips and side condiments, I asked for the soup first but it sat while the pretzels baked.  The beer list was obsolete as they didn't have four of the beers I asked for.  The salad was brought late.  And they didn't clear ANY dishes.  Life is too short to eat at this place again."}
{"text":"The waiter was attentive, but continually gave us new plates, and also referred to me with the awkward pet name of \"dear lady\". He should have asked if we wanted a beer list- despite my small stature and female body, I usually enjoy a beer when I go out to dinner. He was trying really hard though. Meh.

I thought the crust was pretty good, but it was awkwardly sitting on top of a pre-made, thin dough circle that held all the toppings. So although the crust was good, the pizza was hardly structurally sound, flopping around in my hand like a fish. I was happy they offered vegan options, but the tofu didn't have any type of seasoning on it, and the pizza was pretty bland. Meh.

The theme is cute, but it sort of comes off with a fake-TGIF kind of vibe. This definitely seems like a place where stupid corporate policies (maybe, for instance, to refer to customers as \"dear ladies\") are really important to management. Meh.

A far as telling my friends to go here... well, I mean it's a new place on mill that doesn't totally suck. And it's one of the few vegan places around. It's also mediocre and a little overpriced. I guess you should go  if you are around there anyways. I think one word really sums this place up; Meh.  Hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Why do I keep torturing myself??? The last two out of three pizzas I have ordered have been messed up. I can't even count how many times it has happened before. These pizzas are not something I am fine with having messed up and wait another 20-25 minutes for another. They are pricey and I cannot stand waiting an hour for a simple pizza. Our table and two other tables in the clump around us all had messed up pizzas. The server and manager were very nice as to comp our pizza but I can't hold my tongue anymore. I hate to be the negative Nancy but management needs to have a serious talking to the kitchen staff. The servers are aware of how pizzas are ordered and kind write it very clearly but the kitchen staff doesn't seem to care. I'm starting to understand why it seems to be pretty dead every time I go in. It sucks because he pizza is really good when made correctly."}
{"text":"wonderful food and very nice place! on another note I had the most uncomfortable dinner experience I've ever had my father asked for a shot of rum and a large cup of Coke and they repeatedly told him he can not pour the shot into the plastic cup and he understood but for some reason the manager felt obliged to stand at the host station and watch me and my family OUR ENTIRE DINNER it was so disrespectful and very very uncalled for. not to mention how un classy and un professional it was leaving this place I was seriously furious and disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre.  It's difficult to eat anything because of the stench that hits you as soon as you walk in the front door.  Smells like pee and dirty mop water."}
{"text":"Open and shut case. Another example of an over-hyped Scottsdale joint that must be brainwashing its devotees. Kudos on the beer selection. Nice family sports-bar ambiance. Decent Greek Salad. The end...Service was bad and our \"House Special\" and cheese pizzas were forgettable, bordering on bad, which is saying something when you're talking about pizza. Our slack-jawed, nose-pierced waitress took a siesta between bringing us menus and our bll; other people delivered the pizza and incorrect drink order to our party of five. Party behind us were pretty steamed about their service also. I've been, I'm good."}
{"text":"I've officially had the pizza now.
I have to say that it is actually some of the BEST pizza I have ever had in my entire life. 
I actually woke up this morning craving it. The crust is super fantastic. 
I am really boring when it comes to pizza; this meaning that I either only eat plain cheese or I will get a pizza with one item on it. 

Someone once told me that getting plain cheese pizza is the best way to judge whether or not a place actually has good pizza. If you load it up with all that junk you can't taste whether the sauce is flavorful or the crust is good. I am here to say that Mellow Mushroom is the real deal. Their pizza is great even without all of the toppings.

I have heard that the specialty pizzas are phenomenal, so despite my normal behavior, I will have to try at least a few of them.

Mellow Mushroom, I will return for your tasty pies."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere in the restaurant. There should be a sign at the back entrance to go to the hostess stand. If you have work to do on cellular signal you may want to sit outside. There's no cell signal on ATT inside. Food was delicious! 97.0 sanitation score."}
{"text":"after my last review, i received an email from the manager at mellow, offering a gift certificate for our disappointment. i accepted, figuring mellow is close to home and i should give them another chance. i do really like the food. and i'm happy to say that i'm taking mellow off my shit list. 

we've ordered take out twice and dined in once since my (very frustrated) two star review. i have to say, things are better. service has been friendly. our food has been hot and fresh and thankfully, the food has remained really, really good. our dine-in experience was especially impressive - it was friday night, it was b u s y and i went in with very low expectations. we were quoted a 30 minute wait time, and were seated in 18 minutes. things were off to a good start. our pretzels - garlic and parmesean - were a bit underdone, but it wasn't worth sending them back - we devoured them anyway. our pizza was absolute perfection. our server was darling. 

i'm not brave enough to try delivery again yet, but i assume i will be soon if mellow keeps this up. thanks for the improvement guys!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious I'm definitely coming back again ! Order the house special it has a little bit of everything on every bite!"}
{"text":"Nice place, lots and lots of beer choices , we had the house pizza it was very very good , service was great .  We went on a weekday about 3pm , We would definitely return"}
{"text":"Went here today for lunch and had the lunch special- 2 slices, soda for $6,99. I also checked in with Yelp and got bruschetta for checking in. The bruschetta was the best part of the meal. Serve was very slow too.. nothing special at all."}
{"text":"Middle of the road pizza. Have definitely had better and worse. Thought it was def pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I love Mellow Mushroom, I've been to the other locations in the valley and this one is solid like the others.  What I like about this location though is the \"red room\" in the middle as it is DEAD quiet as far as bars go.  Perfect for when you come here with a family type group or with low talkers because it beats yelling over the crowd, idk why the acoustics make everybody's voice bounce off the walls so hard with no sound absorption but it's the way they design the rest of their venues too, they all tend to be loud so the red room is a nice addition.

Their happy hour is great and imo better priced than the Yardhouse except they rotate their taps here ALOT I swear they're always out of that *one* beer I wanted but that's the way it goes.  The other MM locations are impossibly behind with their list of beers available and always have an outdated beer menu due to the rotating but this one actually has decent management because their menu has been fairly up to date and the servers are knowledgeable.

If you like overpriced food and pizza (although good) then avoid happy hour, if you like your beer + apps 1/2 off then RUN to their HH including reverse HH everyday.  Their pizza burns a hole in my wallet and stomach but every once in a while I have to spring for it because I like/love their dough.  If you're into the whole anti-gluten uber veggie weird hippie hipster foods you'll love their pizza selection btw as it caters to that crowd, or you could get a normal pizza (loser)

Bottom line 
- great craft beer selection ALWAYS
- 1/2 off draft beer & apps (HH)
- beer servings are up to 20 oz in chilled glasses
- overpriced pizza, great dough 
- loud fun bar, patio, or quiet \"red room\" you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I was here on a Friday during happy hour with three other people. 

The Happy Hour specials are really good - half off all alcohol and appetizers! We ordered the garlic parmesan pretzels, the bruschetta, the meatball trio, the capri and the hummus. The pretzels were awesome with the beer cheese. I really enjoyed the capri for what it was. Everything else was just okay.

I really love how many craft beers they offer, but I wish they wouldn't list things on the menu that they don't always have. I was excited to see that they had Pranqster, but the waiter informed me \"they don't have it\". Okay, does that mean it's seasonal? Do you only have it during certain times? Not sure why it's on the menu if \"you don't have it\". 

I docked a star because it was so flippin loud in there. I get that it's happy hour on a Friday, but we couldn't even hear each other talk. Maybe add some dividers or do SOMETHING with the acoustics in the room.

Overall, it was a good spot for happy hour and I'll probably be back during the cooler months when we can hang out on the patio where it's not so loud."}
{"text":"We love Mellow Mushroom and were excited to find one here in Phoenix after moving from Raleigh, Nc. MM was a favorite and has not disappointed in the past, with great pizza. We love the red skin potato pie since discovering it at our last visit.
What made this visit 5 star was the customer service we received. Having been seated next to a long (and loud) table nearby ( which I would like to point out is never a good idea) our pizza took a very long time to get to our table, and when I start to get upset then watch out. The manager delivered our long awaited pizza himself at a discount and that made all the difference. Not only did the quality continue for a great experience but we left impressed and satisfied and I get to enjoy leftovers tomorrow- and I never had to say a word! 
It's just as important to have great food as it is to keep customers happy and for the reasons mentioned above we will continue to frequent MM."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom has never let us down when it comes to pizza. When we lived in NC we visited our local one quite often, and since moving to AZ it's our go to place for the loaded baked potato pizza. We order it with regular ranch dressing. 
This location is awesome! You have got to spend time looking at how it's decorated by looking at every corner. From the light fixtures that look like spaceships and change colors to the room with the spinning record on the ceiling. 
Take family, friends and out of town guests here. It might be a chain but this location has the funky ambiance you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Who the hell serves salad thats over flowing and not toss it let alone on a  uneven bowl.. service is terrible. Not coming back and dont try it.."}
{"text":"Mellow mushroom pizza is now one of my favorites. The crust is the best I have ever had and the toppings were fresh. I have been their 2 times now and the serving staff wasn't exactly the most friendly or helpful. I would rate the service as a 2-3 and the pizza as a 5. 
The pizza will keep me coming back, but the service might have me chose takeout."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I have ever had, hands down. We came in Saturday June 4th (one month after their grand opening)at around 6:20pm fulling expecting a wait, especially since we had 13 people total, 6 being children. Again, I knew we would have to wait and we were quoted about 30-40 minutes, which we all agreed would be a fine amount of time for the kids. About 35 minutes in, I ask how close we are getting to having our table together to which the hostess literally pulls out her table seating chart and shows me \"There are the only two places we can seat large parties in the whole restaurant unless we push tables together and they were both seated right before you walked in.\" Okay we tell me WHY was I quoted 30-40 minutes? No one completes a meal that quickly, especially a large group. I could have made a better decision about where to feed my family had I been given an honest quote. Mind you, I've seen about 8-10 small groups get seated while we are waiting so now I'm wondering...why were a few tables not pushed together for us instead of seating all these small parties who came in after us? So we are at about an hour of waiting and now I'm starting to feel like a burden to these people rather than a valued customer, with snotty remarks from hostesses who are actually the reason why were are in this predicament in the first place. We are asked repeatedly if we'd like the patio, which has been empty since we walked in AN HOUR LATER. No, that would be silly. We are offered some high tops when we have two toddlers who need high chairs, so that won't work..all things I told the hostesses from the get go. Jump to an hour and 15 mins into the whole ordeal, we finally get some tables pushed together and our 3 pizzas ordered and we don't even receive the pizza for another 40 minutes...for 3 pizzas in a restaurant that is now slowing down and just steady. ??? We finally get our check at around 8:45, more than 2 hours after we arrive at the restaurant and I overhear the waiter behind us tell the couple who just got seated that their pizza will take about an hour and a half! It's almost 9 and hardly anyone is I the restaurant at this point so what in Earth is going on in this kitchen? To top it all off, the manager just has no idea what he's doing and they only had one guy on for a Saturday night. None of this should have happened one month into opening. These kinks should have been worked out at this point. The pizza was hardly worth it and combined with the service, I will never be going to this place again."}
{"text":"Trying some new pizza place. The wait was a little long. But it tastes pretty good. A little greasy but it is pizza."}
{"text":"Okay, I am Italian and from Chicago so that makes me a Pizza Snob but I do like Mellow Mushroom here in Ballantyne. Went today, Have been there many times before when it was very crowded, today I went after the lunch crowd, It was great service and great Pizza. We ordered the Holy Shitake, a Pizza covered with Mushrooms, Chives, a Garlic Ailoi and Truffle Oil...Delicious..the kind of Pizza that makes you think about wanting it again.. ..over and over! Wonderful-a couple of nice glasses of wine and the afternoon was great....Try it.."}
{"text":"Ordered the peperoni pizza as takeout. It was ready when I picked it up so I didn't have to wait at all, which was nice. The pizza is here pretty dense with thick crust and a really good flavor all around. The Large was HUGE and very filling. The only downside was the price. I think our large pizza was about $24; but given the amount of people it can feed, I guess it was a pretty good value."}
{"text":"We have been here a little over 1 month & 1/2 and by far this has been the best looking, best tasting and hottest pizza ever. All the ingredients were fresh and nicely cooked.  It's not doughy or greesy  

We had it delivered, quick.
We ordered the medium, I believe and let me tell you
there's only two of us and there's plenty for another day.

We will return"}
{"text":"Update...although the pie is sill great, the restaurant hasn't kept up with the crowds yet.  Our last three visits were met with an understaffed restaurant so service was poor, food was extremely slow, and orders were wrong. 

It's in a great location, has good pizza, and a great reputation in other markets.  Hopefully this one will re-train its employees so the experience improves."}
{"text":"When you go to the Mellow Mushroom on Mill be aware of two things:  1 - the day of the week and 2 - that you're near the college.  That being said, unless you are a college student or enjoy people watching, avoid this location on Friday and Saturday nights.  My husband and I were entertained by the drunken antics of a nearby table of college kids but we just laughed it off.

However, being shorted our change by the waitress (no worries I deducted it from her tip) and being forced to wait for plates, a side of ranch dressing, and our bill while she chatted with her friends, is not something we can laugh off. 

The pizza was very good.  I'm not used to a whole wheat crust and it was a nice change from the usual.  I thought the sauce was yummy and they didn't skimp on the cheese.    Our experience won't turn us away from all Mellow Mushroom locations, just Mill Ave on Friday and Saturday nights.  

(Unless we decide to relive our college years and go binge drinking at The Library - LOL!)"}
{"text":"The lunch service is sub par at best. We work nearby and after waiting 35 minutes for salads and appetizers we were told next time we should call ahead a few minutes before arriving to ensure our food would be ready when we arrive. Correct me if I'm wrong, but a few means 3 not 35, we would need to call 35 or more minutes in advance for salads and appetizers to be ready when we arrive.  

Needless to say,  the staff forgot to put in one of the orders and the food wasn't great enough to endure the wait or mediocre service. There are too many options in Downtown Tempe to put up with food or service problems,  Mellow Mushroom better step up their game! 

We will be spending our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"There may be some bugs in the system still but this location has tons of potential.  I would have ranked it 4 stars but our food was a bit off this day.  Granted, we came on a very odd day and mid day when it wasn't very busy and I think that's problematic sometimes for kitchen and wait staff.

We sat at the bar and the bartender was really nice, as a matter of fact, all the staff is super nice and attentive.  It was just the meatballs I had weren't really cooked all the way through to a point where the cheese even melted.  That won't keep me away though.  The beers here are pretty solid as is the case with most MM's.

The interior is just as funky as the other locations as well.  The only drawback here is going to be the parking as is most places Uptown."}
{"text":"Finally was able to try out this location last night.  Went with a friend and sat at the bar for dinner.  Very interesting bar layout with seperate stations that carry the beer taps.  This particular night they had live music via an acoustic guitar player and that was a nice touch I thought.  

The food here is just like the other locations.  Good and consistent.  I went with my favorite, the meatball app and I ended up doing one of their \"build your own\" salads.  It's refreshing to go to a place that actually has the option of building a salad with whatever you want.  Cool.  The beers here are always on rotation much like the other locations, specifically they keep a good stock of IPA's and local craft beers as well as some of the more rare porters, etc.  

Parking isn't horrible but the area does get pretty jammed up so just be patient."}
{"text":"Just as it is with the other Mellow Mushroom locations I've ever visited I enjoyed my time at this one as well.  The parking can be a little tough but other than that it's smooth sailing.  Of course, the menu is pretty much the same at all their locations and my go to meal is the meatball appetizer but I do enjoy the gluten free pizza choices they offer as well. 

This location actually has a nice size patio as well as a cool cutaway of a bus for booth seating which I'm sure kids love to eat at.  

And then there's the beer....always a solid selection."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Mellow Mushroom Happy Hour! Great place for me and my friends to hang out and have great beer and great food.  Love just sitting on tha patio and enjoying the evenings."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had two experiences, so far, at the mellow mushroom.

The first was on St. Patrick's Day, shortly after the Flogging Molly concert at Tempe Beach Park let out...obviously this place would be busy.  We had to wait quite a bit to get the attention of the server, but the place was packed, so I can't hold this against them too much. 

The bruscetta and pizza we got was amazing, one of the better pies I've ever tasted.  With an extensive beer selection and full bar, with relatively competent bartenders that seemed to be able to keep up with the demand for drinks and extended hours, this seemed like a great place for a late night snack and nightcap.

The following week, we return on a Wednesday, about 2 hours before closing time.  We sat at a booth in the bar area and were met by a server relatively quickly.  Our order was taken and drinks brought out, only to find out that they are only doing slices of pizza at the time, not making any new ones...We figured we'd try it out and get a couple of slices with some pretzles to even it all out.  After finishing our slices and waiting for an extra 10-15 minutes, we finally flagged down the waitress and asked about the pretzles, she mentioned that the kitchen wasn't cooking anything new.

We also asked one of the bartenders (who may or may not have been a manager), when they killed the menu for future reference, and was told about 10 or 10:30 they went to slices only of whatever they had available (in a rather rude tone for someone addressing two of maybe 8 customers in the whole place...).  After eliciting our disappointment, they offered to comp our drinks, which were the most expensive items we ordered, which made the visit managable but still very disappointing.

Bottom Line:  Go for lunch, when it won't be too busy, and you'll have a chance at being treated properly.  After about 10pm or so, just go to Slices."}
{"text":"Well we came in for lunch after our son had his dentist appointment.
This place gets busy fast.
We started off with the appetizer of the pretzels. Now they were delish The beer cheese sauce or whatever that was was disgusting. I'd much rather just eat the pretzel plain.
The three of us order the lunch special I got the veggie which was your basic green bell pepper,onion and mushroom really nothing  to rave about. My husband and son got pepperoni pizza.
The service was good our waiting made sure our drinks were full and explained the menu and his favorite items.
Meh I've had bettter pizza..."}
{"text":"We were not that happy w/ the overall experience.  We had to wait over an hour for our pizza and by the time it came it tasted a bit over cooked and VERY dry.  It also didn't help that the dining room smelled like dirty dish water which I think came from the rag the waitress was using to clean the tables behind us.  We probably will not go back there again."}
{"text":"The pizza with jerk chicken on it is all you need to order. Trust me on this. It is so good. Has chicken pineapple and so much goodness and flavor and banana peppers and dipped in ranch and you will transcend directly to heaven while eating this. I have only been once and we ordered 3 pies and this was the only one worth ordering again in my opinion!! We will be back mellow mushroom!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour... Half price drinks and apps! Highly recommend Orange Blossom beer and spinach dip!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the wait was kind of long though, and the price is pretty jog for pizza. But it's gourmet and the variety of toppings is awesome!"}
{"text":"Me and my BFF ate here the other day and it was awesome. Service was perfect entertaining and funny. I loved the food and we are planning on going back this evening to take the kids!"}
{"text":"I was excited to finally check this place out. They were busy but definitely not packed. I waited 15 minutes at my table with no one ever coming over. The bartender made eye contact, so I knew someone saw me. The kids sitting behind me also waited and were greeted as i was leaving. No joke, the server said\"I don't know how long you've been sitting here. Its not even my section, I'm on the other side of the restaurant, but I'm going to take your order. Are you ready?\". Clearly they're understaffed and the staff is under trained in how to present customer service. I left and went next door to eat."}
{"text":"Weird decorations in the place but the pizzas are pretty decent. I don't know what they put in the dough but I noticed that the crust is kind of sweet tasting. The suggested pizzas having interesting names and unique combinations of toppings but surprisingly they work! Really wish they'd deliver!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when this location opened because it so close to my home! But their customer service is NOT like their other locations! I can't speak to the food because after my phone experience, I decided it was better just to order from somewhere else! Jamisha answered the phone, I could tell she was busy and annoyed. I asked to place a takeout order and she sent me to voicemail, I called back and she put me on hold for almost 10 minutes until she came back on the line, but was talking to someone else. I could hear their entire conversation. After 5 minutes of that, I hung up. When I called back and explained what was going on her exact words were \"well I can take your order but its going to take a few minutes, were really busy!\" I told her not to trouble herself, we would just order pizza somewhere else. No apology or attempt to keep me in the phone. Bummer Mellow Mushroom!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place about a month ago, back and forth on deciding to write a review, but since my wife uses Yelp...The place is nicely decorated and has a great bar, but it all kinda stops there.  The pizza is pricey, and i don't mind spending for a good one, but we ordered the Chicken Pizza..it is mostly bread (doughy) and not much chicken on it, nor for that matter any other toppings.  I do not recommend this place other than a nice bar setting.  sorry guys, make better pizzas, its not hard."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Service was terrible. Ordered a vegetarian style Thai dye pizza (menu stated subsitude chicken with tofu for vegetarian). Got the pizza with no tofu nor chicken. Told the server about the missing tofu, and her response was \"I thought you wanted no chicken\". She brought me some tofu on the side (do people usually get topping on the side for pizza??!!), and I was charged for the extra tofu. Wtf?? Will not return. 1. Server was not knowledgeable about the menu items. 2. No apologies for the incorrect order and missing item. 3. Was charged for something that was suppose to come with the meal."}
{"text":"Always love anytime I can get into a Mellow Mushroom for pizza and a beer. The crust is incredibly good."}
{"text":"Service is the worst service I've ever had in any restaurant, on both times that I've been. Food was disgusting; left without eating more than a few bites.   It's a shame, because the MM in NC are awesome. But this one is a dud. Save your money."}
{"text":"Holy crap, my gluten free friends, Mellow Mushroom has entered the fray with a thoroughly credible gluten-free pizza for our delicate sensibilities. I have a low tolerance for bad pizza, having grown up in the Midwest within a stone's throw of Papa Del's, and I had forgotten how good the Mellow Mushroom actually is. It comes down to the sauce and the creative combinations of flavors. The gluten free crust holds up to being held in your hand and has a good texture. I ordered the Kosmic Karma. It's big enough for two and the toppings are fabulous."}
{"text":"I love PIZZA and Mellow Mushroom did not disappoint! I recently stopped eating meat and was craving a Vegetarian Pizza, so I decided to try out Mellow Mushroom! I called a friend to meet me out there and we grabbed a drink, appetizers and of course a vegetarian pizza. 

The atmosphere was fun and trendy! It was definitely kid-friendly and my son had a great time, as well!! I would suggest going on an empty stomach because you will be eating your share of bread! If you're a bread fan, you will love this place. But a person like me, needs to be careful, it is very easy to consume too much and fast. Especially since everything is sooooooo tasty! 

The service was excellent as well! Our waiter was very patient and knowledgeable about the menu! Don't forget to check in and redeem your free Hummus or Bruschetta appetizer! We chose the Hummus, which was good, nothing special about it, I mean it's hummus. The Pretzel Bites were tasty, but they reminded me of bread just covered in salt. And lastly, the Pizza it was delicious, I can still taste it! If I don't go back for anything else, I will be back for more pizza!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gluten free white pizza. The rest of my party ordered three large pizzas and two orders of wings. All their food came out fine. Fifteen minutes went by and my food still hadn't came out. So I asked, they said they'd check. Came back five minutes later and he tells me my pizza crust hadn't defrosted and if I'd want it to-go.... unacceptable is what I told him. I said I don't want it at all. So i ate carrots and ranch. BUT - he comes back fifteen minutes later with the pizza I ordered and the rest of my party was done and waiting for the check. I had a piece and it was awful and under cooked. Needless to say, they took it off the check, but I will not recommend this place to anyone - ever. Nothing about this place sets it apart from any other place that offers gluten free pizza. Oh and our server mumbled, the entire time...."}
{"text":"Not traditional pizza but really good. All the haters clearly have not tried the red skin potato pie. I want to baptize my child in the spicy ranch and the crust is delicious.

They also have a good beer selection and the atmosphere is fun. They even have gluten free and vegan options for your annoying friends. You'll probably have to wait for a table during peak hours and your pizza might take a little while but that's because it is made with EXTRA LOVE."}
{"text":"My husband and I were craving some good pizza so we stopped by. I wish we had gone elsewhere. The service was okay, the pizza was terrible. Our waiter was fairly attentive, all of the staff was walking around with a purpose. The exterior was funny though there was an intense odor of some sort of sewer problem just right outside the door. Inside the restaurant was typical skater boy/psychedelic decor. Meh. Seen it. 

Onto the pizza. When it came out we were excited and starving; ready to dig in. The first bite was horrible. The crust was too thin, and there was more cheese on that pizza than any other pizza I've ever eaten. The toppings of the pizza were saturated in grease, I couldn't dab off enough. As we kept eating it got no better. I ate one slice. We had a large pizza. My husband ate one slice. When the waiter asked if we wanted to take it home we both said no way. 

Now the pizza was bad, but the price was worse. We spent $25 on two drinks, and a pizza of horrible quality. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I am surprised with the poor reviews. This place has a great vibe and is a fun place to hang out on Mill. It is more expensive than the average pizza joint, but the pizza is delicious and very filling. Was packed when I went on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I love me so mellow reverse happy hour. All the beers are half off and they actually have quite a big selection.  Also their hand made pretzels are the best. As are most of their appetizers.  Additionally their cal zones are yummy I enjoy the make your own. As well their pizza is great. All around just a tasty place to go for when you want to change up your normal pizza routine."}
{"text":"Went to the theater within. The same complex to watch Bleed For This, an alright movie, but the spaghetti the cast were watching looked at good that I found myself craving for it. I found that the mellow mushroom closed late and they claimed to be Italian so there is went with the thought I was going good to a that's a spicy meat-a-balla. Walked in and the hostess was going to seat me at a table, so she pointed at one and was seated. I ordered a fountain drink, \"coke please,\" and she gave me the name of my waiter. A few minutes later she told that because I was seated at that particular booth that I'd have to place my order with the bartender. I had the opportunity to gander at the menu and found there were no pasta dishes, so I told the hostess that I'd be ordering my food at another location. Wow..."}
{"text":"Food here is hit or miss. Beer selection is outrageous! Extremely cheap happy hour and reverse happy hour daily. Try the PranQster on tap!"}
{"text":"I guess I just don't get it. Every server I've had here was great, but I just don't really like the pizza. Streets of New York is better quality in my opinion. The crust doesn't have much flavor. It's utility pizza, which like mediocre chinese food is fine under certain circumstances, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Also kind of pricey for what it is...the last time we came here we picked up three pizzas for a family party and the total was over $75.00.  I've tried a few of their funkier specialty pizzas and I didn't like any of them, so I'll stick to basic pepperoni if I go again. They do have a lot of draft beer options, which I appreciate, and it seems to be a great place for families with small kids. One time I saw a guy in a clown suit dining here. Random."}
{"text":"Sigh. I hate to say I'm comparing it to the old one but... I'm comparing it to the old one. To be fair though, I compare all other locations to the old one. 

The Old One, if you don't know what I mean, is the old Victorian house in NoDa that had AN ENTIRE UPSIDE-DOWN HOUSE ON THE CEILING. And giant mushrooms out front to climb on (which are currently inside the Neighborhood Theater.) I mean, it's not that this location is bad, exactly. And I'm sorry that they carry stigma from another closed-down location. But in my mind, MM is supposed to be fun, quirky, makes you go \"Whoa!\" when you walk in. My reaction was \"This is supposed to be the Mellow Mushroom?\" It's edging on boring, except for the bus, which honestly, took me a minute to even notice. 

My food and service were excellent. I'm impressed with their beer selection. The crust was delicious. So, that's good. I just couldn't get over the feeling that I was inside a Ruby Tuesday's or somewhere similarly generic. You'd think, after knowing what kind of reputation they had to live up to, they'd go all out.

I'm not saying I'm never going back, but I'm not going out of my way either. I've seen better."}
{"text":"Let's start with saying I LOVE Mellow Mushroom food and was ecstatic when this location opened uptown.  Unfortunately, the uptown location just doesn't live up to the Mellow name.  They have a great location, fun interior, small patio, and the food is good.  But they also have a bunch of issues.  I've had lunch here a variety of times, and every time it's unbearably slow.   (with one time the appetizer showing up the same time as the main meal.)  With the staff, I always get the feeling that they are in a rush.  As soon as they approach my table, they are in a hurry to leave.  It's strange and not a very friendly experience.  Also, the patio is great, when you can keep away the drifters and homeless.  In one visit, had 2 homeless men browsing the patio area for leftovers, and one even SAT DOWN at a table and ate.  It was a really awkward experience for me as he was in my line of sight and stared at me the whole time.  The waitresses definitely noticed him and didn't do anything about it.  Until this location can get it together, I'll be heading to the Myers Park location."}
{"text":"First time there! Ordered pizza and flys all over, requested manager, and he got at our table with an attitude about the size of Ohio!!! He seemed irritated at our request to move, his excuse was, this is AZ! So thats why so many flys!! Will never, ever go there again!! The pizza is about a 3 on the good scale, crust is tasteless and hard, if you do go there, bring a flyswater!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been sitting here now for 15+ minutes and  were only acknowledge once by the host after 10 minutes sitting here and received water. We're still sitting here waiting for a server, even after a table that arrived after us is been served. 
BINGO! Finally showed up. Very disappointing, as only 5 tables on patio between two servers."}
{"text":"i move here in november from georgia and was so excited when i saw that mellow mushroom was coming to tempe. went last night and was so not disappointed! they have the same amazing beer selection and food that i've grown to love. we got the \"mellowterrainean\" pizza- a greek chicken pizza with a side of tzaziki sauce. the service was good and i plan on going there again to grab a portabello and cheese hoagie"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The atmosphere is awesome and the decorated theme with the bus I see is so cool. You can even sit in the bus which is great for kids because they love it.
The food is delicious every time. And they have great beer specials every day esp for local beers which is pretty cool.
My favorite is the jerk chicken hoagie! It is my all time favorite and I can't get enough of it. They give you chips on the side."}
{"text":"I love mellow mushroom. Their pizza is some of the best pizza I have had. Especially the gluten free crust!! The only thing I would say is that it is a little pricey. You can tell it's a great place to eat by how many people come here. Wait times are usually long but it's a small price to pay for great food!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to mellow mushroom in 3 years, but I remember the beer and pizza, and was ecstatic to see this little gem in downtown Charlotte. Service was good, and my waitress was attentive to my table needs. The house special pizza was sooooooo gooooood. It's definitely in the heart of Charlotte right next to the baseball field and ivy park which was plus. Definitely would recommend for pizza date night."}
{"text":"I have given this place a number of tries over the past year, and every time I am disappointed.

The last time I went, my girlfriend and I got the bruschetta as an appetizer, and my girlfriend took a bite and bit into a piece of metal!

We showed this to the manager, who just comped the appetizer. He didn't apologize, and was rather apathetic about the whole thing.

The service is always slow, the food doesn't seem fresh or of high quality. I keep hoping Id have a better experience, but this last visit with the metal in the food was the final nail in the coffin.

Just be sure to check your food, and have plenty of time to spare... You will be there a while."}
{"text":"This place is very good, I have been a repeat customer to multiple locations and Have always been satisfied by their food quality."}
{"text":"The meatball appetizer is amazing!! The first time we went the service was very slow but it was opening weekend. Every time we go the food is amazing!! A little on the pricey side but so worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, and a wide variety of beer selection. Service is great, the wait for my food both times was a little longer than what I feel it should have been. Other than that, the food was delicious and the wait staff was extremely friendly"}
{"text":"Firstly I would like to say that I love the food here, each time I have visited the food has been delish. However the food cannot make up for the horrid service and horrible managing. We spent well over 2 hours waiting on one pizza and one salad. The manager was not where in sight and the server was either very new or just not well trained. I do not recommend this place based solely on service."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour here! Awesome hot wings and always have to get the spinach artichoke dip!"}
{"text":"The service and beer selection at this location are great. Gary was our bartender and had a good knowledge of the beers on draft and the happy hour is phenomenal. Try the founders dirty bastard on tap."}
{"text":"Bartender J-Rod  made the experience pleasant to the point I will come back because of that service.  Food is legit too."}
{"text":"First time here. Recommended by a friend. Service was excellent ! Pizza was ok, I would recommend Fired Pie over Mellow mushroom. Pizza dough was bland and spinach and artichoke dip-I have had better ."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service went in with a group of friends and first thing you notice no one in the front to seat you or even acknowledge you. Staff was very rude especially the blonde female employee who rolled her eyes at my friend several times attitude. If you don't like your job quit simple also took forever to get our pizzas stay away from this location manager didn't really care about our experience there. Zero stars terrible customer service! Don't know how this place has 4 and a half star rating. I'll be making sure my buddies never come here to have that type of experience."}
{"text":"Time for a Breakfast review !
Thx for the bogo coupon MM !
I had the steak n eggs and my wife had the usual. Eggs, applewood bacon, potatoes, toast.

My medium rare steak was perfect and their smashed (literally)potatoes n onions are crazy delicious! Really....no frozen junk here!

My wifes applewood smoked bacon was delicious as well !
Prices were absolutely on point at 7.99 and 8.99
Gabe was a great server and asked me if i had any suggestions for their new 
Breakfest endeavor.

1-offer hot regular coffee in an insulated carafe like every other breakfast place.
Many will not like french press coffee and it cools very quick. Hot is essential especially after adding cream. 

2- make sure you ask how they want their steak cooked. Mine was luckily medium rare but never assume.
Ya gotta ask.

3- add the steak butter on the side.
People are picky and may not like it.

Overall...a great breakfast and i will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time last night with a party of four adults and 3 children under 12.

Atmosphere was relaxed and casual, but everything was immaculately clean and the booth we were in was both large enough, and comfortable enough for all of us.

The service was Excellent!!  Our waiter, Patrick, was friendly, helpful and very attentive.  The rest of the wait staff I observed seemed to be equally outstanding.

We started off with an order of their pretzel appetizers, which were soft and chewy, just like giant pretzels should be.  They could have had a little more salt on them, but there was enough.  

Then we ordered the House Special.  It was very good pizza, great flavor, and plenty of toppings.  Unfortunately, it took way too long to bring out (20 minutes, maybe 25), and the rim of crust was much too wide.  The wait I'll attribute to the fact that this is a newer restaurant, and it takes a while to get the kinks out of the kitchen process.

To give credit where due, this is when Patrick really stepped up, and made sure that we were comfortable while we waited.   

Also, to Patrick's immense credit, he put the kid's meals orders in as appetizers, so their food came out very quickly, and while the adults waited, they were fed and happy.

So, I'd give this place a 3.5 on the food, but a solid 5 on service.  

More importantly, I'd gladly go back the next time I'm in the area and hungry."}
{"text":"My son and I go here frequently... And we have never been disappointed!!  My favorite pizza on the planet!!!  (Try the red skin potato pizza or the philosophers pie.. Or Maui wowie!). Love them all!!!  Great service, also!  My son gets a kick out of them tossing the pizza dough in the kitchen."}
{"text":"You know, it's tough. Mellow easily has the best gluten free pizza in Charlotte, but the price is prohibitive. 

We ordered two GF pizzas, nothing else. No drinks, no sides, no extras, nothing fancy. $42. What?! $20+ per 10\" pizza? Outrageous. 

Mellow Mushroom shouldn't be a destination date night for gluten free folks like me. It should be pizza, plain and simple and good, and there's no way a personal pizza should cost more than $12-15."}
{"text":"Tried the Muffuletta starter followed by a small Maui Wowie pizza.  Informed both were about to be removed from the menu.  Both were extremely delicious.  We are very surprised that the Maui Wowie is being removed.  We can slightly understand the Muffulett as not everyone is into tapenade like we are.

Downgraded stars for two reasons.  The first was we were hit with someone selling Mary Kay just inside the door.  In fact, we (and others) mistakenly took them as the place to check in.  The Mary Kay reps would not let us go.  The second was due to a longer than usual delay in bringing our bar drink and pizza.

Overall, these issues did not disrupt the day or our enjoyment."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big hype is about Mellow Mushroom...so far all 3 things I've tried (pretzels & beer cheese, spinach dip & meatball hoagie) are crap! No flavor, awful presentation. The only thing I'll say is the atmosphere is nice, and our server is very attentive. Other than that not impressed...."}
{"text":"What restaurant doesn't staff well being in the core center of an ASU graduation night? Yep. You guessed it...

There was one waiter serving a portion of the restaurant. Water alone took 10 mins to receive. We had to flag someone down for a refill.  The refill on water took another 10 mins. 20 minutes and we still didn't have a waiter taking our order. Finally we approached a manager, and the waiter took our order. 

Arrival time 10:15pm - it is now 11:15pm and we still don't have three pies of pizza. If your kid is graduating from ASU, do not come here. We are planning to be here until midnight. :/"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday.  The decorations are what I'd call \"industrial hippy.\"  Kind of strange.  But it was clean and bright.  We of course had to order a pizza, since that is what they are known for.  But it was nice to see salads and subs on the menu too.  You can build your own pizza with a ton of topping choices.  That was nice.  Two of us shared a small pizza with 4 toppings and that was the perfect size for lunch.  The only down side to the visit was part of the pizza was burned on the bottom.  I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place. My husband, son and I went in on a wed. night to avoid a huge crowd. At 7:20 the place wasn't that busy and we were seated within 5 min. Although we ordered at 7:40 ( yes, it took that long to order out food) we didn't get our food for an hour!!!
When we asked the server to check on how much longer it would be she didn't come back to our table for 15 min!!
The food was ok but certainly not worth the wait (especially since the place wasn't that busy)
And the service was pretty bad.
Will not be back."}
{"text":"Insider Joke, THE PIZZA ISNT $3.14 like competitors. Joke on you when you go in for a pizza on Pie Day despite the misleading sign. Besides the joke on scammig consumers, the variety of chips offered is actually just one and though the menu says choice of sweet or unsweetened ice tea, they only have unsweet. Asked about specials and told there weren't any, back of the menu did have lunch specials. The dude claimed that being the host was why he didn't know and shrugged it off. Manager claims this sign just said \"Happy Pie Day\", might want to pay more attention to what your employees are scribbling on the sign when they tell customers its an \"inside joke\"."}
{"text":"Beer seems very pricey, but they have a ton of different kinds on tap.  
The food is absolutely excellent!  I love that they have baked wings.  The pizza my husband and I created (buffulo chicken, red sauce, and extra buffalo sauce) was awesome.  The crust is the best part, so if you're a person who usually skips that part, I highly recommend trying it!  It's got the perfect flavor with just a hint of sweetness to it.  It's really different from anything else I've had!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Charlotte and was blown away by Randy and Alexis here. Even on a super busy Saturday night, they were extremely attentive and were surprisingly speedy. Pizza was great, ambience was great, & service was stellar. Will be sure to come back!"}
{"text":"Delicious, I get hungry every time I pass by this place. I like they are open late when Im coming here with my friends"}
{"text":"The pizza is great.....no doubt. But really, you can't offer any drink specials or happy hour to go along with it? Between the price of pizza and drinks, this place adds up. They do have a cute outdoor area to sit in and a bar that is half indoor and outdoor. That's great when it isn't in the hot summer. I have a strong feeling that I won't be visiting this place again. Service was slow and it was not crowded."}
{"text":"As always, the food was fantastic. Exactly what you'd expect from Mellow Mushroom. The service, however, was non-existent. After our food was brought to our table, the next time we saw our server was when we were flagging him down to get our check...our glasses had been empty for the majority of our meal. Not impressed, particularly since there were only two other tables of customers in the entire place. I hate to think what it would be like during peak hours or on a game day."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times. The first time I got their egg pizza. At first I was like, what? This is going to be weird...but it wasn't. It was absolutely delicious. Breakfast on a pizza? Soo tasty! And their beer selection is impressive! I just went there tonight and got their tasty reasonably-priced steak salad. As I expected it was quite good. The decor, ambience, food, people...really a great place.

But the real reason it gets 5 stars? Because of Tom, the manager. Our steak salads came out well done instead of our requested \"rare.\" Not only did he sit and chat with us for about 5 minutes, he comped the salad and gave us a coupon for next time! We were super impressed. We didn't expect that at all nor even think it was necessary since we're not the complaining-type of patrons. But Tom showed us that he cared about his customers and wants us to come back again and again. And we will! Groovy."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in for lunch 3/15/16. The place wasn't busy at all. I was greeted by Birdie and her trainee as I was dusting off the booth before I got in. Birdie asked if I wanted a table sine the booth seemed tight. (I'm tall and a bit bigger than average). No, I'll ask if I need it, thanks. Then we ordered our food and get drinks. We waited for drink refills, actually her trainee noticed before she did. This continued through our meal. It seemed her trainee was more concerned about us than the trainer. In my opinion she wasn't worthy of training anyone. The food was good but service not so much. I don't think we'll go out of our way to go to this location again."}
{"text":"The BEST pizza - I am a crust person and their crust is great. I drive farther to visit Mellow Mushroom. My main complaint: there is no cell service at bar. If I am alone, I want to text a bit or look something up on line and there is a definite black hole right at the bar."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend for pizza and wings.  The service was great.  The pizza was great.  But warning, the wings are HOT (I mean really HOT!).  We ordered the mild wings and we couldn't eat them. They should come with a warning label or a preemptive word form the waitress.
 Our waitress promptly fixed it and the manager even came over to apologize.  The wings were replaced with the naked wings.  They are delicious.  Great experience and great food but the prices are a little high for a pizza joint. But that's just what I think.  
It was also convenient because they still happened to be open after 9 when our movie let out. So beggars can't choose.  I'd still call it a win."}
{"text":"Hi! We were seat table and server was not said her name as suppose and not keep check if we need to fill our drink and we wait for pretty good 15 min before decided to get check and charge us buchetta which we supposed get free but wait for another 5 min before come our table and foods is ok ok not wow!! My build my own burger is little dry bacon little burn and my Babygirl said her pizza was ok too much doughy (thick)  on her and taste of it not what she expected by BUffalo CHICKEN supposed to be spicy but not taste bland!  We not come back here!!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Good service."}
{"text":"Not worth the price, unless it is Happy Hour. Huge draft selection and the staff is very knowledgeable, however drinks are ridiculously overpriced. TIP: half off at HH. The food is basic, not bad, not great. Kid friendly, nice patio."}
{"text":"I was very surprised at the quality of food and friendliness of the staff. Me and a friend stopped in Friday night, found a seat at the bar, and had a great time! Great food, amazing beer, and a great value for the money!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an impromptu lunch with my lovely wife after years since my last Mellow Mushroom visit.   We were indecisive, while out shopping, about where to go for food and this ended up being the consensus.   Hey, I forgot there's a Mellow Mushroom here, let's check that out!     

We sat on the patio during what was a beautiful afternoon.   This location used to be Rock Bottom until the concept change a year or two (or three?) ago.  Great memories from Rock Bottom.   It was interesting to go inside the building for the first time since that transition and see how...completely different it is.   Even including the front entrance. 

Looks like they retained the tap system from Rock Bottom, and that's great.  Huge beer selection, lots of craft brews.  I like beer so that's a good thing.   

As I said, it's been years since I've been to a Mellow Mushroom and what I remembered of it was...really, really good pizza.    Like, excellent pizza.    We ordered a house special on this visit and it was just mediocre.   It wasn't bad.   Considering, however, that it had Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, Ham, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Mushrooms, Black Olives, Roma Tomatoes, Green Peppers, Onions and extra Cheese (sounded to us like we could NOT go wrong), I thought it just didn't have much flavor.  The crust around the edge was good, but under the pizza it was not crispy at all.    

Our server was friendly and provided good, prompt service.    I drink a lot of water, and she kept me in the water for sure.    I was pleased with the service we received.

In summary, the pizza just did not live up to expectations, and I felt let down.   I don't think I will go back here again as a result, unless I'm in the area and decide to stop in for a craft brew at the inviting looking bar.  If I do that, I won't be ordering a pizza."}
{"text":"Easily some if the best pizza around in the Chandler area. Really good prices and the atmosphere is nice."}
{"text":"Sitting in mello mushroom now and found a bug in my 20 ounce beer after just a few sips.  I asked for it to be sent back and was told I could only have a 16 ounce replacement because I drank some of the beer  Really?   And then the manager,   Austin, came over with this attitude like \"you have some questions?\"  Yeah, my question is how do you treat your customers like that!  Sent the beer back without drinking it.  Let's see if they take it off!  Not the way to have repeat business."}
{"text":"Slow service, not a normal mellow mushroom they don't accept the karma app, wasn't impressed with the service given should have opened after training their staff a little more. I'll drive to the one on mill and university if I were you"}
{"text":"This is the worst place when it comes customer service! We called and made reservations a week ago and they said the could accommodate 20 people without any problem! We then called the morning of and told them we were on our way. We got there at 11am and we didn't get our good until 12:45! The good didn't come out together and it was not even hot! When we asked to speak to the manager,.Beau, he said he was too busy to speak with us.  It got so bad that my manager marched back to the kitchen and asked him to come out and talk to us. He didn't move. We all ended up writing emails to their corporate office and the owner responded. He acknowledge that their service was unacceptable and offered to make it up to us. However, I have no plans of returning!"}
{"text":"It's good food but pricey for pizza so it depends on what your looking for. I love that the pizza dough is fresh and that there are many vegetarian and vegan options as well which is SO nice for a pizza place. The kids menu needs work though. No being able to have juice as an option is one thing but not everyone wants to feed their kid a pretzel for dinner but maybe that's just me. Lots of great beers on tap."}
{"text":"I saw this place on a food show about 3 weeks ago and had to try it. I didn't get a pie as I am from Chicago and knew it wasn't going to cut it. I ordered an Italian Hoagie. The big one. Now I knew right off the bat that our server was a bit light in the brains department, so I tried to talk slowly. We had two cocktails before the food came out. When it did arrive I was bent. This isn't going to fill me up? This is the large? I have been bent for a week wanting to rip this place. But I just looked at the receipt and we were only charged for a regular. So it was the servers fault. On to the sandwich. It was on a crispy roll stuffed with meat and veggies. The chips were homemade and crunchy. I would have appreciated the hoagie I saw on the tube. But it's all good. As I remember how tough it was to breath and stand erect without passing out at that age!"}
{"text":"Ah, the Mellow Mushroom!  The only thing mellow at this restaurant is the attitude of the wait staff towards serving food.  I do love the pizza here and I'm a fan of their every-changing selection of craft beers, but after overlooking their horrible service during my last three visits, I overlook it after this last visit and won't be returning . . . at least not to this one.  

First of all, if you want to be known for your beers, make sure your staff actually knows something about beer.  When my buddy found they didn't carry Stella, he asked for something Stella-like.  The waiter actually said, \"well . . . we have light beer and some dark beers, what kind to you like?\"  What part of Stella didn't he understand.  After a 'Dance of the Tards' between my friend and the waiter trying to get him to understand what Stella-like meant, we finally had to get the bartender over to answer our questions.  

We walked in at exactly 5pm.  Didn't talk to our beer connoisseur waiter until his first visit to our table around 5:15.  The first beer didn't hit the table until almost 6.  We ordered apps and a pizza.  Between 6 and 6:30 I watched our waiter shoot the sh*t with the bar staff and never walk to a table.  Finally at 6:30, after the table that came in about 20 minutes behind us was already finishing their pie, I flagged down another waitress.  Our was still talking to the bar staff; probably planning their next World of Warcraft raid.  When he did return to our table, he actually told us he forgot to put in our order.  Well, no $#!* . . . you haven't left the bar in the last 30 minutes.  

We asked for a manager.  Then asked again.  Then one more time.  As I write this days later I'm sure they are still looking for him.  We finally demanded from the bartender to have another waiter work our table.  Our request was honored.  We finally got our food, well at least our pizza.  The manager is probably in hiding with our apps.  

Bills comes and we get charged for everything, including the apps we didn't get and a second beer we ordered but never saw.  We paid cash and gave the waiter a -$20 tip.  We thought that should cover the apps we didn't get as well as the discount we should have been offered by the non-existent manager we never saw for the piss-poor service."}
{"text":"Great zaa! 

Built my own pizza. Standard mozzarella, pepperoni, sausage, and jalape√±os on thin crust. It was delicious. The $4.50 for a can of Coors Light was a little steep. Other than that they have a great beer selection (I prefer light beer with pizza). 

The smell hits you instantly when you walk in. Nothing like fresh baked pizza scents when you're hungry. 

Cool decor."}
{"text":"Okay so, we waited 50 minutes when they quoted us 30. I'm sure they do it so you stay. BUT the food was delicious. Seriously, it was very good and I will return for it. Kind of a bummer to wait so long, and they wouldn't take a reservation although tables of 10 were being seated as we waited. 

I had the red skin potato pizza without bacon and it was phenomenal. The crust is so flavorful and sturdy but not TOO thick. Cheesy, and garlicky yum. The spinach dip appetizer also so good. Will be back - probably to go."}
{"text":"I think people are being a little harsh on this place. I thought it was pretty good. After reading the reviews my expectations were low but my Groupon addiction had gotten the better of me and I had to spend the Groupon I bought a few months back. Boyfriend and I headed in on a Sunday night. The place is huge and it was kind of empty so seating was not an issue. 

We ordered BBQ wings and a sausage pizza. Seeing as it wasn't that busy we started to wonder when we didn't get our wings. Then we got our pizza. Hmm. So I said \"we had wings too.\" The waiter went back to check and we got or wings in just a few minutes. We didn't complain (they didn't come out that late, really) but they offered to take half off the wings for the mix-up. Nice service!

The pizza had a nice chewy crust, not too much sauce and a decent amount of cheese. If you like lots of sauce you may want to request extra. The crust was kind of buttery and reminded me of the crazy bread at Little Caesars - yum! The wings were a little on the small side but had a good flavor to them.

So while I can't say it was the best pizza ever it was good enough that I'd eat it again for sure."}
{"text":"One of those places that you go to because it is new... And never plan to go back. 
- food over priced 
- small portions
- not many pizza toppings on the pizza 
- greasy crust
- asked for \"\"thin\" crust and got thick rolled dough edge 
- bland tasting pizza 
- asked for water with lemon = no lemon given 
- waited too long for tab to be picked when the place was NOT busy. 

Not impressed- will not go back."}
{"text":"I want to like this place..love the commercials.  The place is just sub par.  Ordered take out-a simple pizza...got there and waited 30 minutes past my estimated time it was to be done.  Then got the wrong pizza (checked before I left).  Waited another 30 minutes...they gave me a free humas.  Have been here three times and not impressed with the pizza or the sandwiches."}
{"text":"What a fun place! I have had friends rave about this place, but had no idea what it would be like. I loved the decor - the lighting, the drum kit chandeliers, the album art and great music blasting. It's clean, it's has an \"open\" feel, and seems very family friendly. I went with my dad on a Saturday afternoon and it was about half full - some folks at the bar (nice tvs) and several families. 

Good: We ordered the Holy Shiitake 10\", which was plenty big for the two of us!  It was very unique, and I've had a lot of truffle oil/mushroom pizzas! Big fan. Great decor

Bad: The service was lacking. They were pretty attentive, but not friendly. Not the hostess, not our waitress. A chef from the kitchen came to ask us about our meal as he cleared our plates, and when I remarked about the unique deliciousness of the pizza we had, he told us how much he doesn't like mushrooms. I mean, whatever, but I wouldn't mention to patrons how much you dislike the pizza they just told you you liked? 

I'd DEFINITELY return. I loved it - just bump up the service and it'd be a 5-star place!"}
{"text":"The specials here are great, as well as the reverse happy hour. Pepperoni cheese bread is the greatest! So fluffy and delicate."}
{"text":"I'm good with Mellow.  I eat there often with the kids.  Large gourmet white with pesto swirl is our choice.  My oldest has celiac and we order her a gluten free pizza which works well for her since we worry about cross contamination and can't eat out much. Mellow has it down.  Today's gf pizza was a bit caddywompus and for $16.00 I feel slighted.  This was a takeout order and I didn't see it until I got home."}
{"text":"I'm so happy Mellow Mushroom opened up a block from my house! I've watched it being built for a few months now with promises of great exotic pizzas and fifty draft beers and I couldn't wait to try it.
Kristen and I showed up at four thirty(I have a very early work schedule hence the grandparent like dinner time) and we were greeted by a bunch of enthusiastic employees, it was fun, they must have had all the employees on for the opening. The Mellow Mushroom is sort of eclectic inside, a mix of modern style with urban influences and some typical pizza parlor flair. It was welcoming and they played a wide range of music from the rat pack to techno. They also have a cute little store where they sell their shirts and pint glasses and whatnot.
Okay, it being the opening we relied heavily on our great servers advice, he suggested the pretzes to start so we ordered half cinnamon and honey, and half garlic butter and parmesan. It came with six HUGE pretzels, three took up a large pizza tray, we had no idea they were so big. Kristen liked the sweet ones more and I liked the garlic parmesan, but both were great(and with half off happy hour they were only three dollars!) We then had the Kosmic Karma pizza, we made some substitutions suggested by the server and ended up with a 14\" olive oil and garlic base pie with mozarella, spinach, feta, roma tomatoes and pesto sauce. It was wonderful, every ingredient brought something great to the table and the crust was awesome. The pizza is not cheap but not over the top expensive either, it makes sense, they use very good ingredients. 
So to sum it up, we really like Mellow Mushroom and will be back. From the wonderful happy hour(half off all appetizers and most alcohol), to the large beer selection with a bunch of local brews and the delicious pizza, we are pleased to have this new pizza joint in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"OK so I went back for a third time. Pizza quality is still excellent... but service this time was abysmal. 

To sum it up, G. our server was non existent after taking the order. (others ran out the food) She eventually showed and brought the check. Neither the GM or server, ever checked on our table (party of 6), and we all wanted another round of drinks too. She brought small pizza boxes for the left overs (after urging), when asked for a larger box (there were two med pizzas with one slice each out of it) her response was, \"just put them on top of each other\", I was flummoxed. 

Not sure what was up... we noticed two other servers (women w dark hair and tats) doing 90% of the work in the main room, they were phenominal workers. Otherwise it seems to be almost overstaffed, with ghost servers. Really put a damper on a nice evening.

My advise, just order take out and save yourself aggravation."}
{"text":"Somehow everything in Ballantyne just isn't as good as other locations. Just like Brixx and Cantina, this MM is big and spacious with patio seating and the same menu as the Myers Park location but there's something about it that's just lacking in umph. And it's not the tacky MM hippy vibe features (this one has it to) but perhaps it's the staff - they seem like they're working and not hanging out like the staff at MMMP does. Maybe it's the boring surroundings. Or the pain in the ass parking. Whatever it is, I don't love this MM and I don't hate it, but it's basically Myers Park's lame big sister to me."}
{"text":"YUM! I am not a pizza person, but this place might turn me into one. We went on a Friday night, 11pm and they weren't offering their main menu, instead a late night menu, which is as follows:

Slices - $1.50 + 25 cents per topping (all toppings available)
Wings - $0.50 each
Bruschetta -  $3
Spinach Artichoke Dip - $3
Hummus - $3

We started off w/ the bruschetta and my taste buds were high fiving each other it was so good! Crumbled feta on top, there were six 2 inch rounds on the plate and all were fresh and delish (did I mention only $3?!).

I tried the buffalo chicken pizza w/ pineapple and the jerk tofu w/ jalapenos and both were A++. My date got steak and onions and BBQ chicken, and the steak was so great he ordered a slice to go for lunch the next day! Pizza was just great and I'm excited to try more combinations.

Our server was Tom and he was great - attentive but not overbearing. I had a specialty beer drink called The Lava Lamp - Guinness, Stella and some Framboise - YUM! Only $5.50 too :)

Only beef I have with this place is the lighting is HARSH. We sat in a booth under a bunch of street lamps they have set up as decor inside - we were the only people there and it was just TOO bright. Uncomfortably bright. Don't know if they can dim the lights as the evening goes on, but it was enough to agree to always sit at the bar away from those lamps!"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously understaffed. We had to take our food to go and we live 45 minutes away. Cool atmosphere but wouldn't recommend it based on service."}
{"text":"A nice space, family friendly with a menu that is diverse enough to please lots of people. Service was attentive, thoroughly professional and unhurried. Really like the Soul Music on the Muzak. We agreed it is a good value too."}
{"text":"My pizza was absolutely delicious and even better was my service. Noel was the best server I have had in years hands down. I came here during the rush of the gameday and everything still went smooth. I would recommend this place to anyone. Don't miss out!!"}
{"text":"When the Mellow Mushroom first opened the service was excellent and the attitude was great.  We really liked that place a lot. The food was also very good and consistent. However, after about two or three months the attitude started changing and service started becoming a big issue. We stopped going there for awhile but went back recently.  The common thread that we've noticed is the bartenders do not pay attention to their guests and are not very friendly at all.   What made me think of this is when we were sitting at another restaurant and we completely had the opposite feeling of great service great attitude and very comfortable environment. They need to look into how they are conducting themselves and perhaps visit Bobby Q's across the street or Baja Joe's on Gilbert and McKellips just to get an idea what good service and attitude looks and feels like. Don't even get me started on the manager with a hat on sideways. He has never acknowledged either of us on any of our several visits to the place. The example start at the top!"}
{"text":"Stopped on a Wed 5:30pm to have a drink while waiting for a friend and it is extremely loud and busy but the staff handles it very well and are friendly and attentive. I will say that the male to female ratio is about 90 to 10. If you are looking for a whole lot of men to hang out with this would be your place."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Very inattentive bartenders. This place is probably the worst location! I'll keep going to Tempe...they have their stuff together."}
{"text":"My daughter decided that we would be having pizza today for dinner, so we headed to MM and got ourselves situated for a feast.

Starting with the bruschetta as an appetizer. Really nice chopped tomatoes on the crusty bread, the drizzled balsamic was excellent. Scooped up every little bit. Five pieces is a weird number - it does not divide very well!

Then the pizzas. Veggies for me and it was well loaded up. The crust was nice and crunchy but just a little doughy. I really enjoyed it and we brought half of it home. My daughter chose the Thai Dye and substituted tofu for the chicken. It was also tasty and the cucumbers on it really gave it a nice clean flavor. Yum!

Good service and good food. A solid \"Yay! I'm a fan.\" experience."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I ordered spinach dip and asked for tortilla chips instead and they denied me because they said it comes with the bread. Not only that but the spinach dip was dumped in foil. LOL what kind of restaurant does that. Not good in customer service at all not happy at all."}
{"text":"Returned for a 2nd visit. I had the wings and a steak calzone. Everything was very good."}
{"text":"Great meal here, Everything came out in a timely manor and just love their pizza creations. Magical mystery tour and mega veggie are the best so far. Have been here several times and will be back."}
{"text":"Looks like I'm not the first nor will I be the last to write this comment.  DO NOT GO to Mellow Mushroom.  It took 20 minutes for our waiter named Ryan to come check on us.

Food was bland. Service was awful.  Prices were even worse.  I wouldn't have minded the pricing if food and service were decent but it's the worse I've been to in Phoenix.  Period."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have had nothing but cool and fun experiences. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants to just chill out with a great atmosphere, great staff and overall a great experience everytime!!"}
{"text":"Being from Chicago I have found it extremely difficult to find good pizza since I moved here a few years ago.  I didn't go here because I was looking for a chicago style pizza so my expectations weren't high. I was blown away by how good the pizza is. It is definitely my favorite in the valley. I will be going back time and time again."}
{"text":"I like the food and service but tonight I walked in with my 5 year old son who had a 2 dollar cup of Rita's water ice.  He said they would not let us in with any outside food or drink.   I think it's a stupid policy.  I won't go there again."}
{"text":"I will say the food was decent however I just say the service was very poor and the waitress seemed like see did not want to there. Last time I will prob go here"}
{"text":"Pros:  the entire time I lived in Phoenix, I never ate here. This was a co-worker's fav place and she talked about it all the time. Pretzels pretty good. The pizza with the baked potato was incredibly tasty and filling. 

Cons:  Pizza OK. Service was decent. It could have been better since there weren't that many people there on a Saturday night, but not the worst I've ever had. Whatever my friend got wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Nice location, friendly staff, and good food. This location is an easy on/off from the freeway if you're stopping in for take-away, and is also in a nice location to stop in eat if you have time. It can get crowded and loud, but they have a lot of seats and rarely have a waiting queue."}
{"text":"Walked in here thinking it was a good pizza place for the family and we were completely appalled at the satan worship theme. When we first walked in, the host had on a shirt that said \"Hail satan and good pizza\" and then when we sat down, the waiter's writing pad had a goat head on the back of it. Creepy and extremely offensive but what bothers me is that the outside looks like a kids place and it was a big waste of time. Christians, do not support this hell hole."}
{"text":"I was a little worried about eating here based on Yelp reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised by our experience!

Our server was very attentive and really helpful. She suggested the pretzels as a starter and they were delicious!

I was disappointed that they've done away with their slice specials, but they still had a small pizza with one topping & a drink for $8. 

I had the spinach salad and it was so good!! I got the small and it was the perfect size. 

Overall, it was a great experience and I'd definitely come back! Great service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent pizza here - the Kosmic Karma, which has sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, roma tomatoes,and pesto in addition to the red sauce, and we added meatballs to it. The quality of the ingredients and especially the flavor of the crust were excellent, and there is an extensive tap-beer selection and full bar. But I had to dock a star for the prices - like almost everyone else on this site, I feel that they're charging probably about $5 more than they should for the size of the pizza you're getting. We sat in the bar area and had excellent service, but our server did alert us to the fact that the pizzas take about 20 minutes to get to you."}
{"text":"First of all I loved the unique decor it. The service was excellent as well. The manager Jenna was very attentive &  helpful. The prices are a bit high bit only because the ingredients are top notch so remember that you get what you pay for. Great!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Charlotte. Unfortunately understaffed and somewhat dirty floors and tables need cleaning. Pizza and salads are wonderful. But the colorful plastic plates needs to be trashed.....incredible amount of scratches and knife marks on surface"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza, consistently same quality. Very good craft beer selection and a great spinach salad (get the dressing on the side---strong). Cool decor, bring the entire group"}
{"text":"We ordered the mellowterranian, Maui wowi, and the Thai dye pizzas! All of them were good but the Thai Dye was easily the best! SOOO delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Good place to just come relax with your friends and eat some bomb ass food."}
{"text":"Family friendly atmosphere with a sport bar area that is off to the side of the restaurant. All the staff we encountered were friendly & helpful in getting a high chair set up.

The pizzas my husband has orders look amazing, I've snuck a few bites and they are tasty. I ordered the mushroom club, & it was a good warm sandwich. Next time I'm going to try one of their salads :)"}
{"text":"Restaurant has a very open air feel, lighting is great, outside patio has lots of tables, bar has optional doors to cater to the inside and outside patrons. 

On this visit I had:

Bruschetta was served on thin pieces of bread, the mix was very tasty. 

Italian hoagie it was very good, bread had a good taste, meats were nice and fresh. 

Hot wings were juicy and fresh, had just the right amount of bite for me. 

Service was great, our server was attentive, kitchen got the food out in a nice timely matter."}
{"text":"Ok, as a former Atlantan, this downturn in quality at my local mellow mushroom is a little disheartening. 

Our waitress tonight was amazing and on point. Service and detail oriented, each star of this review go to her. 

Food was ok. Nothing brilliant but ok. Price is on the high side - over 3 bucks for a coke (yikes) and our medium pizza with two toppings was over 20 bucks. That's ok because we're mellow mushroom fans from way back. 

The restaurant was pretty empty for 730 on a Saturday night and oddly empty as compared to their fellow eateries across the parking lot and street. We thought it strange that we got right in without a wait when all the other spots were packed. 

Pizza is pizza. Hard to screw up.

For the relative emptiness- service was a touch slow but overall fine. 

Our biggest complaint- gnats swarming us at our table - while eating - gross. Both my husband and I found ourselves swatting gnats away from our faces and food multiple times during the meal. This restaurant is barely a year old. I suspect a dirty bar with dried up sugary food sources as the main attraction for the gnats. 

Hope this isn't a sign of serious issues. 

Ps - please bring back the cinnamon sugar pretzels."}
{"text":"The garlic pretzels were hard. The pizza sauce didn't really have a flavor it was very  bland.."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey but the pizza quality is very good. The service could be better but other than that great to go with family and friends."}
{"text":"Food ok, not raves but decent. BUT Service was terrible!  Place was 3/4th empty @ 2 on a Sunday with plenty of servers. Waited 10 minutes for water & menus. Oil & Vinegar decanters arrived with only 1 squirt barely left with 2 salads ordered. Another 15 minutes to get more dressing! Pizza was good but again another 20 minutes after to get tab. Forks were so cheap they are the bendable kind. We had to laugh. Would never go back or recommend. Too many other good places would h good service!"}
{"text":"Very poor service, and it was a slow Monday night!

Think they were doing us a favor, very slow & unresponsive. Not 1 server seemed happy to be there, smiled, looked sharp or polite. Pizza crust good but too many better places that seem to be happy to have you."}
{"text":"I love this joint! Reverse happy hour is great of you want to hang out after 10pm. Great pizza,Salads and beer selection! Try the Moose Drool or left hand milk nitro stout so smooth on draft. Great service and busy atmosphere! We eat here 3-4 times a month"}
{"text":"The Boozer was this best.  This local pizza is a Hit. Try it with your favorite brews and share. This was my first trip to MM. Great times.  Shared the Boozer pizza with my Son on Veterans Day.  Thank you for your support of local Veterans Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Pretty cool establishment. I had dinner at the bar, which I highly recommend. The staff at the bar were very attentive. I had a couple of Maui Brewing Company coconut porters w/ dinner. I was pretty impressed they carried the brand, one of my favorites. For dinner I had the egg and pancetta pizza, which was pretty darn good. However, it could have used more pancetta and less crust. Next time in Phoenix, I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"We have been to this location several times before with positive experiences.  This time was not very positive.  The dip appetizer said that it had sourdough toast points but was served with pita slices tasting very plain.  When we asked, we were told that the pita is the \"default\" bread. We were not asked what our preference was.  The pizza crust was very uneven from thickness, so it was raw in spots and overcooked in others.  Probably won't bother to go back."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and have dinner after work with friends. Wait staff is super friendly. Great drink selection. Pizzas are a decent size. Always have leftovers which I love the next day. Kosmic karma is my fave!"}
{"text":"Got a medium pepperoni pizza for three to go.
It took around 15 min which was pretty reasonable. The reason why i'm giving it 4 stars is that the employees were not very nice, a worker was smoking and drinking in the little take out area. They also seemed really young, and not too interested in helping us when we walked in to get our pizza.
However, the pizza was really yummy. It had lots of cheese and pepperonis. It was a little greasy, but the crust was amazing! The crust was really crispy, but also very chewy, and the crust was also very flavorful. It had lots of parmesan cheese and garlic. Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast & eat mellow all the time, this has been the worst experience I've ever had. The food is absolutely amazing so don't let that mush you away, but the service is absolutely terrible. We sat at the bar & they obviously just didn't care about us. I've worked in the service industry for over 10 years so I understand when it gets busy or things happen, but when there are two bartenders behind the bar & we were three out of four bar guests there was no excuse for the awful service we received. Thankfully we were just visiting, I would be really upset if this was my regular mellow."}
{"text":"Wow.. the pizza I had here was the bomb.com! I loved their vegetarian options and how many veggies they put on the pizza for such a reasonable price. I hate at other restaurants how much extra that you have to pay for a real veggie pizza. The only reason I gave mellow mushroom a four was the service. Our server seemed to be on crack and was like always running away from our table. At one point I asked for extra napkins, which were not brought with our pizza, and he brought me two. like so random, didn't realize there was a napkin shortage at pizza restaurants. Other than that, best veggie pizza I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great food and casual atmosphere. This location has a special menu item that is only served here called the Caesar pizza and it is amazing! Pesto sauce, salad, and pizza all wrapped into one?!?! I'm definitely in HEAVEN! My group of 5 showed up around 5pm on a Sunday and didn't have trouble being seated, though people were showing up left and right after us. Servers are friendly but a little slow at checking on your table...I guess you could say that's part of the \"mellow vibe\". I would highly recommend this location for a casual date or get together. The Tempe location is great also, service the there seems to be a little bit faster. I was disappointed that the Mel's Crabbie Mule was not served in a copper mug, but the server explained it was due to a lame regulation. Also try the bruschetta it's a great starter! Overall this and the Tempe location are #winning"}
{"text":"Pretty cool atmosphere! Nice wait staff, quick bite to eat. Must try the beer cheese knot they were amazing."}
{"text":"Worst pizza of my life.  So tough both the knife and fork glanced off it.  

Does it really take 45 minutes to get a small pizza here?  Nothing, nothing to do or look at during that time, unless you count a huge oil painting of a gangbanger and enjoy staring up his nostrils.  Two TVs but sports, of course.  Who cares?

Server never even stopped by once to say our food would be out soon.

My butt actually went numb waiting for the food.  And then when it finally came...

DH finished his pizza but frankly, he'll eat anything.

Never, ever coming back."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I usually don't review places after a first visit so I will try here again and I hope management fixes the issues of just opening growing pains. Let's start with the good. My wife thoroughly enjoyed her burger. My steak hoagie was pretty good and the chopped salad was ok, although not really chopped. Now the not so good. Although my steak hoagie was good and I ate it, it wasn't what I ordered. I had ordered the chicken teriyaki sandwich. I didn't notice until I started eating which was unfortunate since when it was set on the table was the last time we got any attention from our patio server for about 20 minutes so I just ate it. My water glass was also empty for the majority of our time there. When we were first greeted by the waitress she told us the pizzas are handmade etc and take longer than most places so if we want a pizza just to be prepared and maybe order an appetizer or salad. I mention this because the table next to us got up and left after waiting an hour for their pizza. 

I've been to the MM in Nashville, which was awesome, and will try this one again after they've been open a bit longer to give them a chance to work out the kitchen and service issues. I recommend that the managers make the rounds checking on tables as they need some TLC until they get it right."}
{"text":"Came here after a day party. Lit, hungry, and tired. This place was our saving grace and we ordered some of the most basic items and left happy as clams. 

My date and I shared a medium cheese pizza with an order of Thai chili wings. 

I asked for garlic to put on pizza in which our server gave us garlic aioli. Dipped our pizza in that and it was bangin. Pizza was delicious on its own but the garlic aioli put it one step above. 

Loved this place, great food, great service. Definitely coming back, may try something new, but thoroughly enjoyed our simple yet very tasty meal."}
{"text":"Date: 1/17/2012
Work Group

The Pizza was a-ok, think Papa John's might be just as good as Mellow Mushroom. The only difference, is that there are way more toppings to select from at Mellow Mushroom. Perhaps its this Mellow Mushroom in that made the pizza, okay. I've tried other (3) Mellow Mushrooms in other states, like Atlanta, GA.

Now the BEER. Great selection. FIVE STARS for having plenty of things on draft. I tend to go for the Indian Pale Ales (IPA), especially if the carry local beer."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times now and also done take out. The first time was the first week of being open. Both the service and food was great. We got the breadsticks, Caesar salad and pizza. All were great quality. 
The second time we brought a few people with us to show how good this place is. Not the experience I wanted to show them... They told us it would be a bit of a wait(an hour for pizza) which we said would be fine as we knew it just recently opened so it will take a bit longer. We ordered pretzel bites which came out looking good. I would get them again, I'm crazy for anything pretzel. The pizza came out over an hour and a half later and was subpar. The steak pizza had very few toppings and wasn't distributed on the pizza very well. If there was more toppings, it might have made up for some slices having very few pieces on it. The service was slow but the servers were friendly.
The third time we did take out. We were quoted a wait time of 25 minutes. Great, we were doing a few things then would go pick it up. We got there about 30 minutes after we called. We told them the name and one of the guys went to look for how long it would be. The other guy said, \" oh, I have that on my piece of paper.\" He couldn't find it for a few minutes. The other guy came back and looked a bit confused. The guy looking for the paper found his pad and said here it is. It wasn't even put in the system yet... The gentleman(seemed to be a lead or manager) asked us if we wanted to go the the bar area to wait for everything to be done. We did and we also got drinks. He came out to make sure we were doing fine and told us he put a rush on the order. We got our food and the pizza looked great. I didn't check out the subs. We got the check and paid the bill. I don't ask for discounts but thought there would be something applied to this situation. We get home to eat the food and like I said the pizza looked good, tasted great and plenty of toppings! The steak subs were good and a good amount of substance in the middle. The sausage could have used more sausage as you could put all on one half and eat it. The taste on everything was awesome! 
Overall on the 3 times we have been to your establishment, I am giving it a 3 star. I would like to see better consistency throughout the whole process. I just recently moved here and saw the mellow mushroom signs, I knew I had to go. I had it first in Hilton Head Island. I want to see it like I did the first time at your establishment, flawless. I love the food, I don't want to see this place disappear..."}
{"text":"I don't know what is going on at this restaurant but it's not good. We bought a groupon because we've eaten at the location in Denver and loved it and know its a bit on the pricey side. The second we walked in by the hostess stand, it smelled terrible, almost a sewage issue smell, and no it did not smell bad outside. We sat on the patio but then the people next to us started smoking so we moved inside. Sewage smell would waft around every once in a while. We started off with the spinach salad which was pretty good. We opted for Half house special and half funky Q BBQ on our pizza. Both sounded awesome so we were excited to get it. Meh, definitely not great. One of my pet peeves is when pizza dough can't handle the toppings, the second you pick it up, all of the toppings slid off. I had to eat it with a fork and knife. It was super greasy and just Meh all around. 

The service was fine, everyone seemed pretty indifferent and bored being there. The general environment just felt like a dirty college restaurant, which I guess makes sense since it's on Mill. I was just hoping since it's a chain, that it would still be decently maintained. When we left we saw our waiter hanging out in the t-shirt shop area of the restaurant on his cell phone and unprofessional things being said between waiters while we were eating. It was just an overall strange experience. Definitely won't go here ever again and don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Best pizza we've had in a long time. The crust had that chewy crunchiness that all great pizzas need to have. My kid had a pepperoni with bacon, I had the Mighty Meaty, while my wife and my other kid shared a Holy Shiitake Pie. She said it was the most decadent, most flavorful pizza she'd ever had, and it was polished off. We also had a great Caesar salad with tons of crunchy romaine and garlicky croutons. Amazing food. 

The service was super friendly and the atmosphere very funky with lots of artwork on the walls. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It's good pizza and across the street from where I work so it makes for a great lunch spot. They have daily lunch specials during the week which makes it much more affordable. (under $10 for lunch)

My favorite is the Holy Shiitake pizza but you really cant go wrong with any of their specialty pizzas.  their pretzels are equally as amazing as is their mushroom soup.  I swear I'm not obsessed wtih mushrooms this place just does them right!"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is a great concept all around. Good pizza, great beer selection and plenty of TVs to watch the games. This place is always buys but the service has always been good."}
{"text":"Why did I think going here was a good idea?

For some reason, I thought that Mellow Mushroom was going to be some kind of pizza bistro, with emphasis on the 60's. Boy was I wrong. 

First off, this sports bar doesn't know what it is. Being a graphic designer, I know about the funky concept of branding, which this upscale TGI-Fridays completely tosses out the window. From the 60's font on the outside of the building, to the Modern skyline artwork on the walls, to the 10 different genres of t-shirts the servers wear, this place is chaotic and terrifying. 

And the food experience was even worse. 

First off, we got the Artichoke dip, which was ok. It was hot, which was nice, but I prefer a nice crust on the top of mine, which didn't happen. 

Then came the 45 minute wait for our pizza, which was then delivered to another table. 15 minutes after that, our server realized what happened, and to be fair, she was very apologetic, and it wasn't her fault, it was the fault of the runners. So, they made up another pie, and a manager gave us a comp meal and 2 free pizzas, which is nice and earns them a star. 

As for the pizza, we got the buffalo chicken pizza, which really needed more chicken and hot sauce. Most of what I had was a cheese & ranch pizza. The chicken was tasty, though very sparse, and the hot sauce was tangy, which is what I expect. I only wish there was more. 

The dough was very good though, and the pizza tasted decently cold the next morning. Slight hints of sweetness come through the crust, which was nice.

However, the disaster that occurred there, along with the schizophrenic atmosphere has chased me away for good. I will be using those coupons though when the time arises.

Lastly, looking around at other tables, I do not recommend the Pretzels. I see that there is an image of them on here, DO NOT BE FOOLED. I see NO reason to have to wait 20 minutes for Pretzels that are not even the size of a hand."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the service was terrible. We waited 5 minutes to get seated and there was nobody to greet us walking in and it was extremely slow. We finally got seated and our waiter was no where to be found. It took much longer than usual to get food and appetizer just overall slow and lacking service."}
{"text":"Welp...got food poisoning within an hour of eating my food. Thank goodness I was already home or it would have been one embarrassing night at this place. Had the brushetta (which I have had plenty of times here and never gotten sick)...The tomatoes were not good I'm guessing since that's what I was sick from. It looked fine when the food came out so didn't really think know anything of it. Probably won't be coming back here for awhile!"}
{"text":"1st visit at mellow mushroom it was takeout and it was a 1hr wait for pizza!
2nd visit we got a table as soon as we walked in but it was still an hour wait again just for pizza! We didn't stay we left.
3rd visit was not a charm! Ordered takeout pizza 45min wait and then by the time I got the pizza home, I then realize they had left three ingredients off the pizza! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"First time there last week. Ordered a cheese and italian sausage pizze. Hardly any sausage. Server did not ask if I wanted another glass of wine but asked my husband if he wanted another beer. Also we asked about thin crust  but when we ordered he did not pursue and we ended up with their standard crust.   Finally the server never asked how our food was. The topping was we had to ask for extra sauce because the pizza was dry."}
{"text":"Okay Beer was cold I can say that after that I was somewhat taken back by the lack of a lunch crowd. I tried their small spinach salad I can say it didn't come close to the picture ( nice candied pecans abound) not on this salad. Okay here is the simplicity of the salad spinach, feta cheese, chopped candied pecans, dried cherries, cut apples - balsamic dressing ( you can do this at home). Sat at the bar alone meaning the server taking care of the bar was working the floor friendly but not at the bar so my service suffered. Really leaning on the NOT returning side of the fence. Maybe if back in the area, really wasn't a warm fuzzy feeling. Did get a cold beer though! Sure a fancy place for very basic food at a price. No up selling not the best experience - so I would say try it and if it works for you great otherwise I did share my dime's worth."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on the Mellow Mushroom. The pretzels we tried were really good, the pizza however not so much. The crust was different, but the sauce and the cheese just felt wrong. Maybe I have been spoiled with good pizza lately, but this is not a place I would return to grab a pie.

Their sandwiches and salads sound good, but even more appealing is the happy hour deals. Great beer list and half off? Enough of a pull to get me to return but I will stay away from the pizza on future visits."}
{"text":"The pies are definitely tasty and unique. You can tell the ingredients are quality and fresh. Our service was efficient around 6:30 on a Wednesday night, except all but one of five salads had the wrong dressing. Our server, Brandon, was attentive, personable, and friendly.

This is where the positives end.

Biggest bummer for me is the value. The pizzas are understandably on the high end, I assume, because of the ingredients. Fine. $10 for a salad with iceberg and romaine? $9 for a 3oz pour of a bottle of wine that costs $9 at Fry's? I guess if you don't want the veg and you're more into beer, your value will increase. They have to pay for that funky decor somehow.

Can't promise I will ever return."}
{"text":"I came here tonight with a group of friends. I ordered the Kosmic karma pizza. It was so good!! I would totally recommend it! I gave it a four star review because the food took longer then expected to come out. Other then that we had a very enjoyable evening :)"}
{"text":"I thought I already reviewed this place. But here goes. Friend had a Groupon. We had pizza. This is my second trip to the over-priced but good Mellow Mushroom. Last time we had the Magical Mystery Tour Pizza. This time we did the Mega Veggie. The place is really neat, lots to please those with AHDH. The food is very good but way overpriced. Probably to keep out the riff raff on Mill. Whole wheat dough was pretty good, not too heavy as can happen. Veggies were fresh, but the feta and tofu were overkill. I will stick with the Tour. If I ever go back. Beer was cold. Service was good. But $25 bucks for a pizza is a deal-breaker for me."}
{"text":"The service was great. The pizza/calzones take about 25 minutes when they're not busy but the crust is well worth the wait. I ordered a calzone with pepperoni and banana peppers and there was the perfect amount of cheese and flavor. I tried a slice of the pepperoni pizza and the bottom was soggy and the slice was covered in grease. I'm would give this a three and a half if I could because the pizza was not great, but it is still worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Lil\" Caesar Salad.  Cost $5.19, with tax $5.84.  Salad consisted of about 4 oz of romaine lettuce, 1/8 oz of shredded parmesan cheese and 6 croutons.   The most pathetic salad I have ever seen.  Will never go back even though they are directly across from the street from my work."}
{"text":"My partner and I had our first trip with some friends to the Mellow Mushroom, and I am incredibly sad that we have not stopped in before.  I have been on a quest to find amazing pizza in Charlotte, and I can say that this place has the best pizza I've eaten so far.

What makes their pizza so amazing, you might ask?  First off, their crust is scrumptious!  It's part whole wheat, and it has a great, chewy texture.  The wheat gives it such a great flavor.  And secondly, they have such a plethora of toppings you can add.  You can get several different types of cheeses, meats, veggies, and even fruit.  I've got to say, that's pretty wicked awesome.  Finally, at certain times of the day, you can get pizza by the slice.  And I'm not just talking about one tiny slice - the slices are giant!  It's like eating a quarter of a large pizza (well, not quite, but you get my point, I hope).  And it's not just some pre-made slice, you can choose what toppings you add to your pizza.  What a stellar idea!  They have several vegetarian options, and they even have a selection of gluten free pizza offerings too!  

Besides pizza, they have appetizers, salads, and even calzones.  They also have a large selection of beers, and apparently you can join their beer club to get rewards.  How awesome is that?

And in addition to great food, the decor is all trippin' in there.  They psychedelic theme permeates the tables, walls, and bar area.  They even have an old hippie bus all decorated up, with booths you can sit at in there.  We had great service there, and our server was so enthusiastic.  Their prices are a little higher than other pizza places, but the quality is outstanding.  And if you get pizza by the slice, you can get a large slice with multiple toppings for less than $5.  It's very filling.

Oh yes, I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Always GREAT food and OUTSTANDING beer selection but it's really expensive. Still worth it, but if you get an appetizer, some pizza and a beer or two expect your tab to be over 40 bucks."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places, easily. All their food amazing, especially the bruscetta and pizzas. I recommend the Funky Q Chicken (bbq, chicken and bacon pizza), the Mighty Meaty and the Cescar Salad pizza. Also they always have a huge selection of craft beer, both tap and bottle selections. They also do seasonal special taps here and there. This is an awesome place for lunch, dinner or late night drinks; it all works."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and good service!  Definitely a place to try out when in Charlotte. Try the karma pizza, very yummy and filling. I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've been about 50 times so it gets 5 stars.  The happy hour remains the best in the valley and the food is good.  The bartenders are great and the beers are constantly rotating and interesting.  Your best bet on food, in my opinion, are the sandwiches.  Get a half on a pita for $6 paired with one of the 50 or so beers and you're feeling good.  

They also now have an app which allows you to earn free apps and stuff from your visits which is cool."}
{"text":"I love the Mellow on Mill and this is my first experience at the Stapley location. Logan is a fantastic bartender I've never been so impressed. I will definitely be coming back!!! Their happy hour is great! Pictured 'Grateful Dead'."}
{"text":"I got a groupon for Mellow Mushroom wanting to try it out after hearing good reviews of the pizza. When we got there we were seated quickly and got asked by two different people if we wanted drinks. After getting our drinks, we ordered our food and  that's where the good feelings quickly changed.

While the pizza itself was good, the service was by far the worst I have ever experienced. Our waitress didn't return for over 45 minutes between when she placed our order and brought the check. Not once did she check on us to make sure everything was good or to see if we needed anything. I had to ask one of the busboys for a refill on my drink because the waitress never bothered to come by (or to the other two tables by us).

I had high hopes for my big out, but after this experience I won't be back. Perhaps just takeout if I'm in the mood for the pizza."}
{"text":"Great customer service, like the atmosphere, only down fall is the time to wait for the pizza to come. But the taste and the flavor pays off.. good job"}
{"text":"Clean, fast, and friendly. Usually cant trust soup from places but it was delicious! Pizza is a little on the greasy side, but still tastes great."}
{"text":"I really like the Mellow Mushroom. This is the fourth location I've been to and the service is great as well as the atmosphere. I really enjoy the doughy pies the Mushroom offers and have always liked the food. I ordered a make your own today and wasn't disappointed. This is a busier location than the others in town but that didn't impact my experience."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty consistent across the board, so I'll mainly talk about this location in particular.  The parking SUCKS.  We were ushered in by a gentleman and luckily got the last spot that was right outside the restaurant.  It's just not built to accommodate a lot of people, so hopefully they'll do something about that in the near future to make it more easily accessible.

The wait staff was pleasant--casual but engaging and they got our order correct.  We were on a  bit of a time crunch and asked them to expedite our order. It seemed to work--we had our food in a matter of minutes after that request.  Plus, it situated in the heart of Myers Park.  What's not to love about MP?"}
{"text":"VETERANS DAY!! This establishment was on the list of restaurants that allowed a free meal for veterans of the military on Veterans Day. Unfortunately they turned several vets away because they required you to dine in...no carry out. This was not mentioned online and last year other Mellow Mushroom restaurants in the Charlotte area allowed take-out and/or carry out.
I would NOT recommend this place simply based on the rude host and the demand that veterans have to dine in to get the free service on Veterans Day.
If you must have Mellow Mushroom, pick another location.............this one sucks!"}
{"text":"Very tasty.  Great beer selection.  Lots of vegetarian selections.  Family friendly but also solid for a date night or random dinner out.   Pretzel appetizer is great; cosmic karma pizza can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We took my son there tonight for his 12th Birthday this evening and it was awful. My older son placed an order for a drink that was replaced with a different one than he ordered, then when he went to order a replacement, they were all out. I placed an order, they came back saying that they were out of that one too. My sons salad had mushrooms, when he had asked for it not to have them. Then, they made the pizza wrong as it was supposed to be 1/2 pepperoni & 1/2 cheese and had to make another one, then we were charged for two instead of just the one that I ordered and then they burnt the replacement!!! My 10 y/o daughter still had no dinner by the time we were all finished, when the Mgr said it would only take an additional 5-6 more minutes to make another one?! We wound up taking that one home. The Mgr did comp my son's Birthday dessert when they're usually free at any other restaurant? Although the food that did arrive tasted good, we will never, ever go back there again!!!"}
{"text":"Good lunch specials...staff was very nice.  We were here during the turnover from day to night staff and the service lagged a bit, but otherwise was very attentive.  Food ordered was chopped salad, adding grilled chicken with herbed basalmic dressing..very good.  Other lunch ordered was the Old School Jerk chicken hoggie....was good, came with chips.  They have a lot of unique beers on tap...ask for samples, they are happy to oblige.  Will return!"}
{"text":"Happy hour specials are the best that I've yet to find on Mill.
I'm from out of town and I will definitely be back anytime I'm in the area!
Great staff, great food, & well made drinks!"}
{"text":"We had a groupon for the Mellow Mushroom and I was eager to try it. I was skeptical because of all the mixed reviews but overall we had a good experience.

We started by splitting a Caesar. The croutons were great. Definitely homemade. The dressing was great too, but unfortunately there wasn't enough of it. Very dry salad.

The pizza is very good. Doesn't make it in my top 5 of pizza in the valley, but tasty nonetheless. We had the kosmic karma. Very good combination of ingredients, although the toppings are a little sparse. The crust is very good! I LOVE it when pizza crusts are kicked up. Otherwise I usually don't eat the crust. This crust is buttery, soft, and a little sweet. 

The beer... The good news is they have a wonderful beer selection with many seasonal specials. It was very hard to decide with all the tasty varieties. 

The bad news is how overpriced the beer is. My husband and I had 2 large beers a piece and our beer alone cost $28! Our food was less than that! They should consider selling pitchers. Its places like this that make me miss Uncle Sam's where you can get good pizza and $4 premium pitchers.

The service was great. We sat in a booth in the bar and had 2 servers tag team our table. Both were super friendly and fast.

Sigh. I really do like the pizza but I will think I will only order takeout and buy a six pack of seasonal brew and enjoy my beer and pizza at home."}
{"text":"The MM is a total Meh bar/restaurant. They have your typical 'okay' pizza, an average beer menu but nothing great. This just happens to be one of those places you go because a buddy is there with a group of friends and you get that text to head over, and you're all 'sure whateve'. Nothing fancy, nothing to die for, but you'll inevitably end up here. You probably wont go back though."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mellow Mushroom. I wish we has them up north! The Umani pizza (I thinks it's unique to this location, I've never seen it at another Mellow) was delicious! Sweet, spicy, savory, every bite was different. A must have!"}
{"text":"I had to go back a second time before writing this review to be sure that I was right. Maybe there was some extraneous factor to my first visit here that colored my perception? Was I just really hungry, or was I caught up in the hype? So it's been a few weeks since then and I went again late on a Saturday. And, well, you can see the stars. My brain didn't trick me the first time around.

Mellow Mushroom makes every other pizza place look plain and mundane in my eyes. Walking in the door is already a huge sensory rush - it's bright, colorful, the decorations are warm and cartoony, the music is rockin' and my GOD does it smell good. Instantly my expectations were met with the atmosphere.

Step one: ordering. The menu's big and the beer list is diverse. Everything from $9 pitchers of Magic Hat #9 to $20 pitchers of Young's Double Chocolate. Order a pitcher (it comes with incredibly sturdy glassware) so you can dig into the menu. I've stuck to the pizzas and calzones as it's hard to break such a delicious habit. I have heard the sandwiches and salads rock too, so if that's your boat you won't be hung out to dry. 

Side note: if you want an appetizer, you must MUST get that cheesy garlic bread. Holy crap, it was like eating the food equivalent of gold.

But what really brings me here is the pizza, and it has yet to disappoint. The crust is crisp and has a bit of sweetness; it's thin in the middle and thick at the edge -  like getting a free breadstick with every slice. I repeatedly order the House Special, a supreme pile o' flavor starring pepperoni, ham, sausage, bacon, olives, onion, green pepper, mushrooms, and fresh-sliced Roma tomatoes. Every piece of my pizza was bursting with fresh flavor and I could taste most every ingredient. Danielle has had the Philosopher's Pie and the Buffalo Chicken on our two visits and I've tasted both with impressive results. The Buffalo Chicken was especially impressive and had a great spicy flavor to compliment the chicken.

The one request I have of you, fair Yelper, is to try something new. I typically avoid mushrooms and olives, but they rocked my world on this pie. Don't just get a pepperoni and cheese because you will miss out on what the Mushroom has to offer!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I'm from Philadelphia so West Coast Pizza is another animal. I had the 14\" cheese pizza and meatball app. The pizza crust was good, but the sauce was way too tangy for me. The pie itself looked like a deep dish, but when you started eating it, you realize its actually a very thin crust. It was OK....the meatballs were good and served with long toothpicks..kinda odd, but it worked. 
I ordered TO GO and the servers were very friendly and accomodating to my request for a fork and knife since I was in a hotel."}
{"text":"Good take out service! We got the Maui Wowie pizza and it was AMAZING! Pesto sauce with bacon and pineapple and ham and chicken. YUM. It's a bit pricey but I enjoyed it :)"}
{"text":"Normally a frequent visitor of the Rock Hill location but I work closer to this location.  Figured I would grab some pizzas for my employees (2 pies and a pretzel order).  Order wasn't ready when I got there 30 minutes after calling it in.  Order also wasn't quite right as they only had me down for a half size pretzel instead of the full-size I ordered (simple mistake no big deal) but that didn't upset me as much as them not having it ready.  The worse thing was that when I asked for ranch I had to pay for it ($60 on pizza and I can't get some ranch?) I get ranch every time at other locations and have never had to pay for it.  The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 was because the hostess tried her best to apologize for the kitchens slow service and for being made to charge me for ranch.  Will take business to other locations that appreciate it."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim and sat in the bar area.  It would be nice if the servers would mention the happy hour specials.  We would have ordered much more food and stayed longer.  It was nice to see the discounts on the bill, but she short changed herself on easy going customers who tip well.  I have heard the location at Desert Ridge is much nicer and the food better, as well as a real Mellow Mushroom feel, maybe the manager should take a trip over and see what they are doing and take it back to Norterra."}
{"text":"Love coming here, the bartender (cannot remember her name) is always so nice and helpful. Amazing beer options and happy hour, which I believe is half price Most beers and apps). There's also a groupon right now for 20 dollars of food that costs only 10$!! Love the pretzel bites/wings!"}
{"text":"For starters, I will say that I hate the name of this place, which sounds like it should only attract stoner vegans... but moniker aside, I've long been a big fan of Mellow Mushroom from my past lives in other states, & I was pumped to see that it exists in Cleveland, too. I figured the Red Skin Potato Pie was a D.C.-only special, but apparently it's at all locations, which makes me just about the happiest girl alive - I've never gotten anything else there! It's so, so good - cheesy & saucy & a little spicy & very carby... all my favorite things (plus a side helping of guilt, but that's for later).

Also delicious: Garlic butter and Parmesan pretzels. THESE ARE HUGE. Don't order them alone, you'll be mortified. And full. Of carbs & guilt, but also of happiness.

In my humble opinion, the servers at this location are friendly but not as on-point as they could be. We've been double-charged for items, & while the staff is kind & quick to remedy problems, it would of course be preferable not to have to have those problems at all. Still, you can't beat Mellow Mushroom's big, open indoor space & their outdoor bar & the wide-open front window space that makes you feel like you're sitting outdoors on sunny days even if you're sitting inside (bonus: no sunburn!)

As other reviewers have noted, it's on the expensive side, in a way that has seemed OK for me in other cities but seems sort of annoying & unnecessary in Cleveland. The prices don't quite work here. But who am I kidding? I'm not going to stop eating there any time soon."}
{"text":"Bomb pizza and fast service! I will be back for the happy hour specials.  I hear they have a great selection of crafts on tap!"}
{"text":"Very very spacious... Don't think it can ever get crowded ;) I ordered red headed step child and it was decent... I cannot compare it to the amazing cocktails I have across the west coast... Mediterranean pizza and chicken wings for food ... A very pleasant experience for a Friday afternoon happy hour :)"}
{"text":"We love the pizza, but it is soooo expensive! It cost us over $30 for 1 large pizza, and that's just ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I went in about a week ago on a recommendation of a friend who lives in Mesa. We're visiting from CA. Yes the pizza is a lil pricey but you get what you pay for! It was delicious! Not only that but we had the most sweetest waitress named Serena! Her kind demeanor and patience with my very picky husband didn't go unnoticed.  Highly recommend for a date night or girls night great food and friendly waitresses!"}
{"text":"So I'm from the West Coast where BJ's come a dime a dozen. Bj's has really good pizza, and I must say the pizza here reminds me of BJ's. My husband and I got the bruschetta and split a small pizza and we left full. My daughter got the Mac n cheese, and it was so tasty! Knocked off one star because our server would leave for long periods of time. But when she came back she was sweet. Will be trying them again soon."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday with my boyfriend and 5 other friends. Things got off to a bad start when our waitress spilled coke down the front of my off-white dress and all over my leather purse. I was soaked. Even my underwear was soaked. Everyone at the table was shocked but I made sure to be nice and forgiving and for every apology that she gave I tried to make her feel okay about things. I got up and helped her sop up the mess (no other employees came to her rescue) and wipe up the floor (literally on my knees scooping ice and coke up with her) and she gave me a few dish rags to try to dry myself off. At the end of the meal she brought or checks, and she said our two sodas had been taken off the bill. We were all surprised more hadn't been done to make it right. Note: Our friends had all ordered pizzas/appetizers so between the 7 of us, it would be a good sized bill.  My boyfriend and I had ordered the two drinks and a large pizza. So with the sodas removed the bill came to $26. My boyfriend asked her if there was any chance half of the price of our pizza could be taken off the menu. It was uncomfortable but she said yes. When her manager, David, returned to the table he was totally abrasive. Without asking how our meal was or even coming near me to check on my dress or purse, David very hurriedly said to my boyfriend, \"Hello sir, yeah, she told me about the drinks spilling and so we took them off of your bill for the inconvenience. We'll take 5 bucks off but that's all I can do.\" 
My boyfriend, affected by David's abrasiveness said \"We were only asking if maybe half the pizza could be covered. I think that's bull****.\" And David said \"Of course you do. Sorry folks.\" And walked away!  Our experience felt entirely unprofessional. I was disappointed that David hadn't even come to the table to check on us immediately after the accident or during our meal. And by the way, the pizza wasn't good. Terrible experience. My boyfriend was so fired up that he went home and emailed corporate. I did feel bad for our waitress, who was very apologetic and seemed just as disappointed in David's managing skills as we were."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza.  It's a neat atmosphere, and one of the few restaurants that I don't feel to bad about taking my toddler into.  It took a while to get our order, but they were really busy when we went.  There were a line of people waiting outside the door.  We were also with a group.

Since my initial review, I've been back to the Mellow Mushroom four times.  This place is definitely five stars.  The service has been very friendly and efficient, and the food just keeps getting better.  Initially I gave it four stars, because it took so long to get our order, but the past four visits have been much better in that area.  
My husband and I dined in their bar area late one night, and it was a great experience.  The bartenders (Keith and Jenna) were fantastic.  I don't think you'd find better bartenders in Phoenix.  They were friendly, and made a great drink.  They also have a late night menu that is more appealing than your normal late night pub fare."}
{"text":"We went in for the Sunday brunch and ended up ordering off the regular menu because it did not have a lot to choose from. The kids menu looked good but my daughter ate most of our pizza. The tea was watered down and the lemonade was way to sour to drink. It was okay but nothing special."}
{"text":"In general I have enjoyed Mellow Mushroom pizza for several years. I first started going to a restaurant when I lived in another state. When we moved here, we dined in at the Myers Park location and had no issues. When MM opened a store in Ballantyne, we started going to that one as it was closer to our home. 

The Ballantyne location does not seem well managed. The staff seems very young and  they do not seem very well trained. We have experienced incorrect orders, incomplete orders, and just plain bad pizza that had skimpy ingredients. From day one, we have had spotty service and food quality from this location, especially when we do take out. Sometimes they are on and other times just AWFUL.  They lack consistency and you never know what you are going to get.

 I no longer have faith that when I place an order, they won't somehow mess it up. Their crust is good but you do not want to pay $27 for a large specialty pizza and have mostly crust.  They have been scrimping on ingredients IMHO. Their food is not cheap, so there is no way they should be skimping on ingredients.

The last time we placed an order they somehow got our name wrong and we arrived to pick it up, they stated there was no order in our name. After much confusion, they realized the person who took the order put down the incorrect name. We ordered the Funky Q. Chicken and when we got it home it looked like the chef had dumped all the ingredients in the middle and not bothered to evenly distribute them throughout the pizza. You would think that the main ingredient chicken would be prevalent all over the pizza but there were slices that had none.  In fact, it had more bacon than chicken on it, which would have been great if we had ordered a bacon pizza. However, we were expecting a BBQ chicken pizza. VERY DISAPPOINTING!

If you want pizza in the Ballantyne area, I would recommend trying somewhere else. 
I no longer feel MM is worth the price charged.

UPDATE:

In addition to writing this review, I decided to write a note on MM's website regarding our experience. Within a few days, I received a call from the Director of Operations who apologized. He stated the restaurant was under new management and advised that  the new manager would be  addressing a lot of issues at the restaurant. He stated he would send out a gift card as a way to make up for our bad pizza, which I eventually received  I give them credit for acknowledging  the complaint and trying to make it right.

2nd Update 4/11/16: They say the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. That definitely applies in this situation. A year after the above experience, I foolishly ordered another takeout pizza, hoping they had resolved their issues. We were taking dinner to a friend who had requested this Mellow Mushroom. Against our better judgement, we ordered the Funky Q Pizza again- I hoped that they had really gotten their act together. We had much the same result- crust, bbq sauce cheese and little chicken. They tried to camouflage the pizza with lots of sauce and cheese so we really couldn't tell how little chicken it had but when we bit into  a slice,  we easily determined that they had once again skimped on the ingredients. That is apparently standard practice for this restaurant. They really should be ashamed in the quality of pizza they are allowing to leave their restaurant. A large is $25 and you have to wait 45 minutes to pick up an inferior pizza. Not worth it!

 I am DONE  with Mellow Mushroom. If you want pizza in Ballantyne try True Pizza or better yet, do a takeout pizza from Harris Teeter. Their bbq chicken pizza is better than MM and a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"The staff and food is amazing. You can't go wrong here. The pretzels are a must have. The large order has 6 big pretzels."}
{"text":"Great beer selection! Ordered the half order of pretzels which was only 4.50 & it was more than enough! 3 decent size pretzels which were good
Got the lil Greek salad which could of been my whole meal! Love that you can spilt any pizza with toppings so you can share! Sat outside which was a plus! Only thing lacking 5 stars is the service was a slow. Maybe it was an off night cause we will definitely be back portions are big & fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"High food prices relative to what it is. The waiter I had took a long time to acknowledge me on a slow night. Other better places to visit and spend money on."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner and I've never experience such poor service in my life. Fr the hostess to the servers to the bartenders. The hostess was annoyed of us when we asked to sit in the bar to watch the game, we even apologized for asking to sit in the bar but she ignored us. Our server was just so rude. She didn't seem to care about our table and we felt like she was annoyed of us for sitting with her. When she dropped off straws to our table I had mentioned we were ready to order when she was ready and had time. She took my order and began to walk away, my friend had to ask her to wait because she wanted to order as well. She kept trying to walk away after each person tried to order, after the third person I told her that we were all going to be eating dinner. I understand when a server is busy but I told her to we were ready to order when \"YOUR\" ready. She could of came back when she had a minute rather than trying to escape after each individual at the table tried to order. She rushed us through our meal and dropped off the check immediately. No dessert or coffee was offered. The bartenders were even worst. I was annoyed when our server tried to rush us so I decided to get a second drink from the bar. Chris was having small talk with another person, Kara completely ignored me. She stood at the end of the bar and pretended I wasn't staring at her waiting to order my drink. Finally Chris came up to me, I asked about happy hour and Chris told me that it wasn't happy hour. I was genuinely confused because I thought it was 10 pm. I asked Chris what time it was and his response was \"Not 10!\" Okay cool that's not what I asked though. The guest sitting next to me told me what time it was, it was 9:57. So then Chris told me I can order my drink with my server, after I'd been waiting at the bar. I was really annoyed about that too because my server already closed is out ( we never asked for the check by the way, she tried to rush us) and we just wanted to stay back have a few more drinks. I have never in my life experience overall bad service and I'm in the industry myself so I try to be understanding but come on. This was just horrible. I don't recommend this place unless you want cheap drinks and don't care about being treated like crap."}
{"text":"Busy but enough seating, nicely spread. Louder but comfortable. A group of hockey boys were there after a game, groups of friends, families, couples on dates, etc. A good place for everyone! It's a combination of the Dave's Cosmic Subs decor, B-Spot culture, and great pizza. I expect to be going more!"}
{"text":"Its a shame this place is a chain. I'm a huge, huge fan. This is my new \"vegan who needs to keep meat eaters happy\" location. They have a plethora of toppings to choose from, the crust is JUST the right thickness and they even have vegan cheese.

I get the Mega Veggie without cheese and add pineapple. Its pretty tasty. 

My only complaint is for an 8\" pie I have to drop $13. Thats a bit pricey. 

Oh, oh, oh, oh. And Sunday nights are karaoke nights and they're open until midnight (which is UNHEARD of in Charlotte)."}
{"text":"Outstanding service! Logan did an excellent job!!! Kept our drinks full, and appetizer actually came out before the meal unlike some of these other places! Will definitely be returning asking for him!"}
{"text":"WOW is right, what an amazing new spot in River! We had such a great experience here yesterday for their opening day. This place is AWESOME!! Great atmosphere with amazing art work and d√©cor everywhere. The place is huge and I love the set up. Flat screen TV's everywhere!! Our group tried 3 different pizzas and loved all of them. I also tried the mushroom soup and it was delicious. It's really cool that they have gluten free pizza and beer on the menu too. They really do cater to everyone.

The service was great and everyone worked together to check on us and clear tables. Drink prices were very reasonable and they have a huuuuge drink list to choose from. I can't wait to tell all my friends about this place and go back very soon. Check it out fast before everyone finds out about it and it gets packed every night. I can imagine this will happen very soon. Great place !!! Come see for yourself :)"}
{"text":"Did MM change their jerk wing recipe? We don't come here often as its 15 miles away from our NW home, but I remember awesome jerk wings. Today, not so awesome. My strawberry tea was no where near strawberry either. Just different then I remember. Pizza and service was good though."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but after 2 bad experiences we won't come back. The food is still okay, but the service is so slow (even when there were 2 other tables in the entire restaurant) and worst of all, they have a bad fruit fly problem. The first time we were at dinner for my 30th birthday and we spent the entire evening shooing away dozens of these things. We just went back because we really did enjoy this place at one point, and the fruit fly problem was even worse. They were landing in our food and our waiter just said it's because the doors to the outside are open... but that's not where fruit flies come from. I even showed her one in our cheese dip and she did nothing. I'm a biology instructor, those little buggers come from moist, often dirty, and fermenting areas of houses and kitchens. Often the love the open bottles of alcohol at bars. Even if they came from outside.. we shouldn't be sharing our entire meal with them. I'm frustrated because they do have good pizza and beer and would like to go back, but have to recommend you go to another location."}
{"text":"We chose the restaurant for my husband's birthday dinner. Parking is ample, which is always nice. We were seated quickly, and served drinks quickly as well. We ordered a meatball appetizer, which took awhile to come out. They were delicious.
The food came out awhile later and was also delicious.
The atmosphere was fun, and it was very clean. Overall a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Our waiter was awesome and the food was amazing. The kitchen messed up and cooked us buffalo chicken instead of the funky bbq chicken so they gave it to is free! I highly recommend dining here"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the food nor will I, I called for price of a large pizza... The guy gave me a price, then I asked how big the pizza was and he paused,
 sighed and hung up on me. Guess it taxed his brain too much to answer that."}
{"text":"With every where else in the neighborhood slammed before a Panthers game, we decided to order take-away from MM and eat it outside on the patio since there was no server there.  This way we didn't have to wait on a table.  After the resturant started to clear out, we noticed there was a table inside and they were ok with us moving inside and eating our take-away pizza inside.  Sadly, a waitress didn't come to serve us, or offer us refills on the drinks we'd ordered from the bar, but we were still pleased with everything else."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I rolled through for dinner on Saturday 8/2 and had a groovy time. Ryan was our server and he was a chill dude. The service was top shelf. We had the cosmic karma pizza and added some shrooms to it because that's how we roll. Ryan also hooked us up with this killer balsamic glaze for dipping. My gf had a meatball hoagie and Ryan suggested the half size because those babies are phat. It was definitely a good trip with Ryan as the guide through our psychedelic journey. 

Peace and blessings,

Really, I do. I guess specifically I hate marinara sauce, to be fair. But I LOVE Mellow Mushroom.

Get the Yukon Gold, Philosophers Pie or Holy Shiitake. So good, and none have red sauce if you're a hater like me. The crust is amazing. Their Enlightened Spinach Salad is also awesome - spinach, candied pecans, dried cherries, apples, and vinaigrette. They also have Wyder's cider...win! Service can be a little slow but staff is always really nice."}
{"text":"The food is really good.  Some really amazing items outside of their pizza.  The wings are top notch.  

I have been there when it is swamped and when it is dead.  I think the quality of the food is absolutely different when there are more people (worse).

One funny note - if you know the Panthers have a practice in the afternoon  it is a fun time to checkout the bar area.  No, not to meet the Panthers.  To see the single ladies who come in dressed in some amazing outfits and sit at the bar by themselves HOPING to meet a Panther."}
{"text":"My uber cool brother recommended this place to me quite a while ago, only he goes to the mill ave one. I'm not cool enough for Mill, so I was happy to see one open here so I could try it. This place is relatively new so I expected the sketchy reviews, but don't let them scare you off--this place was great! 

From the ridiculously impressive beer menu, to the addicting soft pretzels with beer cheese (get these NOW!) and then on to the stellar pie, we loved it all. My husband and I rarely agree on pizza toppings, so it was awesome to be able to get half and half specialty pizzas without spending a fortune on extra toppings. We chose the Thai and the Potato, and for the first time we loved them both! I would say the Thai was our favorite. The curried chicken really stood out and the cool cucumber freshened it up nicely. Of course we drizzled sriracha for an extra bite. Yum! 

Service was also top notch tonight. Our waitress was on point and the manager really impressed us with his customer service. He really took care of the table next to us that happened to get the wrong topping. Hey, mistakes happen, but it's nice to know they care enough to make it right. We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"There's just something about their bread! It's amazing!!

This restaurant is super casual, with ultra-hip looking, laid back staff. It is LOUD in there. So know that going in. But also know that you're about to enjoy some delicious food and drink. 

If you get pretzels, (which you probably should) you should most definitely order the beer cheese to dip it in. It's amazing. If you order pizza, (which you probably should) you should stick to one of their specialty pizzas. The first few times we went, we ordered a pepperoni pizza, and it's not like it was bad or anything, but the specialties really kick it up a notch. My favorite is the buffalo chicken. 

The service can be slow, but not too bad. This place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I lived right down the street from one Raleigh and in walkable distance to one in Savannah.  I'm annoyed this one is all the way in Tempe. And on Mill Ave.  Talk about horrible parking.  However, Mellow Mushroom pizza is worth the annoyances that Mill Ave offers up.  

The light crust with a sprinkling of cheese, nom nom.  My favorite is the potato pizza.  Potatoes? On a pizza?  Why yes.  Add a drizzle of sour cream and holy smokes Batman, you have yourself a great pie! Trust me. Get the potato pizza. 

However, it is my belief that world peace could evolve if everyone had access to Esparanza Dressing.  They serve this on their salads (which totally rock) but I always get it on the side to dip my pizza in.  I have no idea what Esperanza Dressing *is*, I just know it's delicious. It's tangy.  It's thick.  It's wonderful.

Is MM a cheap joint? No. Is it uber trendy with tons of fancy pants toppings? No. But it's fresh ingredients, great crust, a not too sweet sauce and it's outstanding."}
{"text":"Service and cleanliness of the restaurant was a bit shaky, although the restaurant was only half full. They have a pretty expansive menu that can suit a wide variety of preferences, including some vegan options. I've only had the pizza and it has always been delivered hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom overall is a 3.5 star, but I've enjoyed my food on both visits so I'll round up for good food.

The location is easy to access in the downtown Rocky River area. There are parking spots in front on the street or the lot behind the building. The inside of the restaurant is large with plenty of tables and a large bar area. They even have a rolling door that can be opened on nice days.

The menu offers a variety of options from salads to pizzas to calzones. There are suggested pizza combinations and also the option to create your own pizza or calzone. Pizzas are offered in a couple of sizes so they can be ordered as a large portion for one or to be shared. I'd suggest going with the suggested pizzas if you want toppings because creating your own can get pricey.

On my most recent visit I enjoyed a local beer and a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. The pizza was great. I really like their crust consistency and flavor. The amount of toppings was perfect. Even the small pizza is more than enough for me. It could probably be shared between two people with a starter or salad. 

The first time I dined here we started with Pretzel Bites that were soft inside and tasty. The Lil Greek Salad was much more than little and full with a variety of vegetables. The Greek dressing was tasty. 

The service was friendly and attentive. We were warned after ordering that pizzas would take 20-30 minutes to bake and it ended up being closer to the 30 minute mark. On both visits the restaurant only had a few tables of diners. Even with warning that does seem to be a little long for a pizza spot that wasn't busy. Overall, it's fine as long as you aren't starving or plan to start with an appetizer or salad."}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced but decent pizza. I went on a Saturday night. Primarily ASU crowd. As for anywhere on Mill Ave, this is not the place to go if you're looking for a quiet dinner."}
{"text":"I LOOOOVE THIS PLACE!   I don't live near one but every time I am close - I have to stop. I even order out and drive this pizza 5 hours home! 

I have always had excellent service and the food is just absolutely amazing. I have ordered it for company meetings and enjoy bringing friends & family here.  

Everything is great! Happy hour is awesome! Fun guy pizza, Greek salad, pretzels, bruschetta, Capri salad, stuffed portobello - all fantastic!!"}
{"text":"And why are these people all standing around trying to get into this place?  Is it the food? Is it the atmosphere where all the yuppy kids are taking the kids to enjoy the hippy drug smoking culture?  Or is it just good food, with Psychedelic paintings on the wall?

I am unsure, but I can not see myself waiting more than 15 min to get into this place.

The food \"pizza\" was mediocre at best, and the place is filled with small kids (children).  Is this the atmosphere we are subjecting our children to?  Sure the pizza may be slightly better than Chuck E Cheese, but please......

All I could see around the place were phallic symbols and I was really not impressed.

So, I can say I have been here, done that, but it is definitely not on my be back anytime soon lists.

For all the hype, I am unsure, but it is in a great location.

{"text":"Good pizza and beer selection"}
{"text":"I've had pizza most of my 28 years and this is definitely my favorite crust right now. Interesting specialty pies too"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is consistently good. If you've been to their other locations, you know what I'm talking about. Otherwise, check out the reviews of the food below.

What do I love about Mellow Mushroom? Primarily the doughiness of the crust (and this translates into the pretzel appetizer as well), the freshness of the toppings, the cheap drink specials, the focus on a local experience (in spite of it being a regional chain), and the George Clinton-inspired decor. Even better to come here late night after hanging out with my friend Mary Jane, if you know what I mean.

What do I love about THIS Mellow Mushroom? The service is freakin rad. I've met some really cool people here and they are always willing to bend over backwards to make sure you get what you want. Also: great outdoor parkside seating.

Unfortunately, I can never give Mellow Mushroom five stars... it never really \"wows\" me. But, hey, four stars is solid."}
{"text":"Favorite hangout spot. I'm critical of the food temp here but that's about  it. Nice when slow."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is one of my favorite Happy Hour spots. BEST MEATBALLS EVER!!! I order them so often; one of the bartenders calls me Meatballs and not because I look like one.  Would have given 5 stars if I would have received prompt service on my first visit."}
{"text":"After 10pm half price draft beers and munchies. Friendly staff. Good environment and people. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"It was  a 3 birthday gathering for adults held on the patio, weather was nice with adequate fans, limited outdoor sports tv, pizzas were good but not excellent but there was a wide selection of all kinds, margaritas were not outstanding and pricey. Very good selection of brewed beers, Service was outstanding for this large a party and they tracked your individual purchases. Had a good time with friends and family."}
{"text":"Convenient location since I was at a conference around the corner. We were a group of 13 but still got seated and had our orders served pretty quickly. I ordered a house calzone with garlic instead of mushrooms but they left off the garlic, so was a little disappointed. But still a flavorful calzone and some good pizzas on the menu as well so would not hesitate to come back if I'm in this part of town again."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered half Karma Karma and half Holy Shiitake Pie pizza and spinach and artichoke dip as an appetizer. I am not a huge fan of thin crust pizza and therefore I would have prefered a thick crust but our pizza still tasted good. We waited quite a bit for our pizza to be ready but it guess it was a friday night. Overall, i would go back to Mellow Mushroom again."}
{"text":"Worse services that I have ever received in my life. It shouldn't take almost 30 minutes on a half of a sandwich. When I look back in the kitchen they're not even doing anything, just laughing and talking. No line were drawn between the kitchen and the servers whatsoever. Host calling the girls \"guys\" instead of lady. Learn some basic manner when hosting. Tip the server 20% because I am also a server but not a good experience."}
{"text":"My family stopped by for lunch. The four of us ordered two pizzas: a medium meat pizza and a large \"house special\" which was a combo pizza with the addition of ground beef and bacon. The bread was dark and I'm pretty sure whole wheat. None of us was crazy for that. The rest of the pizza was very standard, and I don't really have any extra interesting/pretentious online \"foodie\" things to say about it. We had more than half of a pizza left over. We weren't unsatisfied, but I think I could have had an equal or better experience eating Pizza Hut or Dominos for half the price."}
{"text":"I liked the crust? That's about it regarding the pizza. It was super greasy, took a few napkins to make it feel edible. The bruschetta was alright. The serving staff was alright, kind of slow and not super attentive... it was pretty dead."}
{"text":"Great tasting food , friendly staff,  casual atmosphere. 
Greeted promptly at the door, sat immediatly. Hostess was nice. Young girl. Not wearing \"booty shorts\" dining room was large and open.  Semi seperated from the bar area with t.v.s etc.
Server was Kyle, laid back guy, he was friendly and proficient.
The menu was varied. Offered items for alternative diets ( tofu hoagie , gluten free pizzas etc) we got the \"holy shitake\" pizza, and it was VERY good. Garlic sauce, mushrooms onions shaved parmesan, herb crust. Im not a big fan of red sauce, so i prefer pizza joints that offer other bases, this place has a few, i saw red sauce, garlic, and pesto, and i didnt read the whole menu so there could be more.
 Prices seemed on point with this neighborhood. 
Bathrooms were modern, and clean, offering hand dryers, and paper towel dispensers that forked over regular sizes sheets of paper towels. The whole building looked clean, and new.
Overall impression: nice, clean pizza place, with bar, offering something for everyone, at the standard price."}
{"text":"I recommend you get Coco as your server. I mean it. He was such a breath of fresh air.

First of all, great happy hour deals! Half off all drinks (except some premium drinks, which are discounted to 5 bucks) and half off all appetizers. Well, with their beer menu finally updated, I was at a loss. Too many choices! So I told Coco to make the choice for me. He brought out a couple samples, since they weren't too busy, which I loved. We ordered some wings and pretzels (OF COURSE. Everyone deserves their pretzels and beer cheese) since it was happy hour. The wings were really tasty! We also ordered the red potato pizza, upon Coco's suggestion. SO GOOD. 

After my previous experiences here, I'll be calling and making sure Coco is working before stopping in. He really turned this place around for us!"}
{"text":"Extremely bad service every time I have been here. Our average wait for a beer is 30 minutes and average wait for a pizza is 1 hour and 30 minutes, multiple times. Unsure why the service here is so awful as I have been to many mellow mushrooms at different locations in the past and the service has been just fine. This has been happening for over 2 years at this location."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place ever since I saw the sign go up before they ever opened. But things kept getting in the way and preventing me from going, the finally I was given a groupon from my sister to try it out and I got really excited. 

Upon entering I was thinking, it's pretty cool inside, but where are all the TVs? I saw a couple on one end of the place, but we got seated at the other end, and I always thought this place would be kinda like a family friendly sports bar kinda place, but its just tables chairs and booths. I just shrugged it off, I was hungry anyway. 

I ordered a calzone while my wife ordered a buffalo chicken pizza. My calzone was really good but the pizza was just eh, there menu looks like it has a lot of good stuff but i guess it was just that pizza. 

We will definitely make another trip but now that we know it's probably not a good place to catch a game, we will wait until we're looking for more of a just dinner place."}
{"text":"I have visited twice since I've moved to Charlotte. I have tried the balsamic drizzled pizza and the Portobello mushroom hoagie. Both were actually pretty good. The atmosphere is nothing to scream about. It actually reminds me of undergrad where my neighbor across the dorm who used to dabble daily in \"Herbal\" remedies. Too Austin Powerish for my liking but to each their own. Now to the nitty gritty...the service is HORRIBLE! It takes an eternity to get food. I placed in an order an hour early and when it came time to pick it up...they said it would be an additional 20 min. What's the point of placing an order ahead of time if I'm still having to endure a significant wait time. Sounds backwards to me. I've only gone here due to necessity but I probably won't be back due to the service. They may want to hire additional staffing or figure out a methodical way to cut down their wait time."}
{"text":"I almost chose to live at the Catalyst since Mellow Mushroom is on the first floor. Probably a good thing that I don't live there. My favorite is the Maui Wowie with chicken, bacon, pineapple, banana peppers, onions, etc. It's a large space for a pizza place in Uptown. Kinda pricey for pizza though. You'll find a mix of business professionals and residents in their pajamas here."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this local spot in the heart of charlotte. I ordered the Holy Shiitake and my boyfriend Mellowtrianian. We both really enjoyed our 16'' pizza and finished both our halves minus 1 slice each. We loved the outdoor seating, but we had to bat off a few flies and homeless men asking for money. Not sure who was more annoying. 

I would recommend the Holy Shiitake, however, be sure to ask for light garlic/mayo drizzling. I love sauce as much as the next guy, but it was just way too much, I had to scrape it off the pizza."}
{"text":"Let's talk about beer for a second.

They have, and I'm serious, 48 beers on tap and an additional 55ish in bottles and cans. So even if you don't like the pizza (which is borderline impossible, shit's great) you can get hammered 105 different ways and forget you ate it.

Now, I will say its a bit pricey on the food front. A large ranges anywhere from $16 to $26, but it is quite delicious so I put up with it. They also have hoagies and crazy salads. I recommend the BBQ or Buffalo Chicken pizza, by the way. I get the BBQ to the point that the bartenders (who are all lovely) make fun of me when I order otherwise. Or don't drink. What just because I'm usually drunk I gotta drink every time I'm in here?

Alright fine I'll have a kiltlifter.

Oh, and slices till 3am. Whaaaaa!?"}
{"text":"I have had a LOT of bloody mary's in my life and this is not the place you would expect to find the perfect one, but Garrett makes the absolute best Bloody Mary I have had Uptown in my four years in Charlotte (Tavern on the tracks is a very close second)."}
{"text":"My Mom and I kept talking about eating here, so we finally went out of our way to give it a try yesterday. The venue is clean, with really intriguing art on the walls, and good music playing. Right away, the service was exceptional. Demitri (hopefully spelled right) was our server, and he is quite possibly the most affable human on the planet. He was super friendly, attentive, and eager to help with the menu. I also noticed that other staff behaved similarly. Every employee that looked our way or came to our table acknowledged us warmly. 
We first ordered the spinach dip as an appetizer, which came out promptly. It was hot, flavorful, and appropriately cheesy. Mom also ordered coffee, and was thoroughly pleased with the coffee press that Demetri brought to her. I ordered the sweet tea, and it was quite tasty. I think patrons could get away with just happily feasting on the appetizers here; add drinks, and you'd walk away full. The spinach dip was very generous, Mom's coffee carafe was filled to the top, and my sweet tea had free refills. I was already impressed. 
For our meals, we each tried a hoagie with chips. My Mom wanted her chicken hoagie a bit differently than the menu offered, and they complied without hesitation. In fact, it was Demitri who suggested the adjustment. Mom was ultimately very happy with her sandwich. I had the steak and cheese hoagie and it was delicious. The meat was very flavorful, and the roll was nicely toasted, but still soft. I was too full to even touch my chips, but Mom said they were those kettle-type potato chips, and they were good. 
The only possible downside to the whole experience was the flies that occasionally dive-bombed us. But that was a minor issue, and whether it could even be helped is negligible. I think if Demitri hadn't been so pleasant, and the food hadn't been so good, it would have bothered us a whole lot more. But, as it is, we're already planning to go back to the Mellow Mushroom very soon."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday night and although it was busy, we were seated right away. I did ask the hostess for a high chair which she never brought. The server then came and took our drink orders and we had some questions about the menu. He was rude and not helpful at all. He didn't smile or even pretend to be good at his job. After he took our order, a soda was spilled at the table, it was all over the table, the floor and my husband. No one came to help us clean it up. We had to clean it with the few napkins that were on the table. The server finally came and took the dirty napkins off the table and wiped the table down however the floor NEVER got cleaned up. We had to sit with our legs up because the floor was covered in coke. 

On to the meal. We ordered Caesar salad which was generic and a BBQ chicken pizza  and pepperoni pizza. My daughters loved their pepperoni however my husband and I didn't enjoy the BBQ chicken pizza. It was cold and chewy. My youngest daughter had the kids macaroni and cheese which she loved but the plate was served piping hot. Why would you serve a kids meal (with a baby at the table) on a piping hot plate?!

The kicker was the bill. There were 5 of us and the check was $65. I guess I wouldn't have minded if the meal and the service was good but I was completely unsatisfied with everything about this meal. 

I will not eat here again and would not recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal customer service experience with my catering order for a work event!!! I dropped the ball and had to order for a large group very last minute and they completely provided all that I needed with a joyful attitude!"}
{"text":"Yes!!!

Mellow Mushroom is my favorite pizza and the decor is really cool!! Seriously, go there...now!"}
{"text":"As a couple who moves around pretty frequently can you say five addresses in less than 9 years we go to a mellow mushroom location just about everywhere we've ever lived and we've been to this location several times we always get good service but this time that we went our pizza was overcooked and the mushroom soup was awful & not as described ion the menu - my pizza did not have the sauce that should have been drizzled over the top.
More than likely we will be back but it'll be a while"}
{"text":"Only 4 stars because the place was so loud! There were 6 in our party and I could only talk to the closest 2.  Besides that our waiter was awesome! I wish I could remember his name. The food was really good and the prices were reasonable. My husband and I shared a large dinner salad which was plenty and we also split a medium pepperoni pizza. The waiter split the salad for us which was nice. Lots of different beers to choose from. Nice place, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here pretty regularly and every time it is awesome! All the food that I've had is flavorful and the drink selection is vast and constantly rotating. We always request Anthony to be our server, he does a great job and knows the menu well, he's always able to offer recommendations when we need."}
{"text":"I previously had written a bad review but now I am updating it.  Service was terrible the last few times but I will say the management exceeds my expectations.  After posting my review the management promptly responded to me and apologized.  Hopefully the issues have been corrected.  We have not had a chance to go back yet but soon.  Again as for the Pizza it is really good.  Again a little pricey as their main thing is the specialty pizzas not just your usual pepperoni.  Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. I have never had better service the bartenders are amazing they have Fenominal draft beers that you can't get anywhere else this place is AMAZING when u come here sit at the bar and ask for Kelly and PJ the best bartenders ever. If u have not been here u need to try it. I have never been anywhere better."}
{"text":"Decided to give Mellow Mushroom Pizza for lunch. The service started out good but as typical for a new chain restaurant, they never came back until it was time to pay. 

The Pizza was good but the \"chain pizza\" crust reminded me of Hungry Howies. The auto pizza oven was not running the belt quick enough and the crust was so tough I could hardly cut it with a knife.

meh"}
{"text":"Ordered the large mighty meaty pizza. Waitress asked how it was and I asked her why there was no sauce on it?  She threw out her arms and said \"It depends\" and walked away.  Pizza was glistening from all the grease and oil I guess from the meats.  The pizza was bland, crust was cooked nicely but also bland and was main component of the pizza.  $26.49 for a large pizza is too pricey for me. Won't be back. Can't even come close to Spinato's!"}
{"text":"This place has been consistently good.

The pizza is very good (Better than most places) and I am a fan of the FunkyQ Chicken Pizza. They have quite a few Vegetarian pizzas (which appeases my wife) and their build your own sandwich option is a good value for fresh food.

It can sometimes be a bit busy and loud, however the service has always been quite good and attentive.

The food can take some time to come out, but it is worth it. I would not come here for lunch unless I had a long break from work.

We usually go on a mid-week night as Friday/Saturday can get busy and there usually is a wait."}
{"text":"Was told a 20 min wait. Has now been over an hour. They're apologetic but it doesn't help when your cranky one year old wants to run in the street constantly. So far, I'm NOT impressed."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about Mello. If you love beer the selection is amazing! Always a new one to try. The staff is friendly and personable. Taking time to let you try or explain a beer or the brewery it comes from. The pizza is yummy! It is a thick style so you are going to wait for it to bake 20-30 min, but its chicago, deep dish style so that's expected. 
The BEER CHEESE is the BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Great variety of pizzas, salads, sandwiches am appetizers!!  Pizza is fantastic and great spinach artichoke dip."}
{"text":"Mellow is the wrong word to describe the vibe at this pizza joint.  WIth a name like Mellow Mushroom, I was expecting to walk into a hippie dive.  The kind of place where everything looks like it's from out of the seventies and dedicated to the herbal drugs that users inhale.  Instead, Mellow Mushroom has a hipster bar ambiance.  Instruments and other musical items decorate the walls giving it a modern jazz bar feel (only with flat screens playing sports hanging across the bar). 

With an overabundance of pizza places in any town in the US, Mellow Mushroom stands out by specializing in uniqueness.  Their specialty pizzas all sound odd but tasty.  The beer menu is huge and the 45 on tape are dedicated to micro and specialty brews.  If you want your traditional domestics, bottle or can is all your going to get.

My fianc√© and I split a caesar salad and a Thai Dye.  The caesar salad was prepared perfectly.  The dressing was mixed in well and not overly creamy.  The croutons were awesome.  They were made in the restaurant, not from out of a box.  Why don't more places do that?  The pizza was great.  The quality from the dough to the cheese to the topics was excellent and fresh.  The sweet curry sauce on pizza actually worked a lot better than I expected.

The service was also excellent.  Our server was really cool about explaining the drink and food menus.  He also pointed out a few things about the layout of the restaurant.  There also was another waitress who stopped by every now and then asking if we needed anything.  The teamwork was noted an appreciated.  Nice to to hear someone say \"let me find your server.\" 

My only complaints are that we were originally seated under a vent, and it was freezing.  They had no trouble moving us, but wow, they may want to save a few bucks on their energy bill and turn down the a/c.  The prices are also a little higher than I wound want to pay for a pizza.  But they do make up for the price with quality.  Mellow Mushroom is definitely worth it if your looking for a change from pace from you're regular pizza place."}
{"text":"It's great to have a Mellow Mushroom in Uptown!  That being said... I think they have found some sort of a balance between the restaurants quirky, relaxed approach to pizza and Uptown's modern, business-like persona.  Being located in one of the newer apartment buildings (Catalyst), this location screams modern from the outside, however it have a small bout of personality with the signage out front:  uptown skyline with a rising (or setting) mushroom in the back.

If you go here for lunch and order a pizza, get ready for a  bit of a wait since they cook the pizza to order (per usual Mellow Mushroom standards).  They have plenty of \"faster\" options like salad or small apps that probably doesn't consume your lunch hour, but I'd say to come here for the pizza.

My favorites include the Mighty Meaty and the Philosopher's Pie.  Nothing beats freshly made pizza.

There are a ton of tables here, and even a bar to sit at.  No shortage of TV's around to watch sporting events.  I guess the only thing missing is a half of a bus you can dine in, or a normal, signature giant mushrooms decorating the outdoor patio.  They do have some pretty cool 60's/mod sci-fi art that sets the mood for the restaurant.  For some reason, the bright orange chairs in the dining room remind me of the Jetsons.

Servers are friendly enough and make sure you are well taken care of.  Great place for little ones and conveniently located next to Romeare Bearden Park.  You can escape the heat of the park for some nice A/C and snacks."}
{"text":"My \"usual\" Mellow Mushroom trip involves me going over to the Selwyn location, but this new\"er\" location in Ballantyne may change my mind!  Went over here after running a half marathon on a Sunday so we were pretty starved for food by the time we got there.  The best thing is that we got there right at twelve [on a Sunday] which = cocktail time especially after running that far and for that long.

I partook in the special $4 Bloody Marys... I love that the server asked me if I liked them \"extra spicy\"  and they totally were worth the extra spice!!

We sat upstairs with the awesome touchscreen tables... so we were thoroughly entertained by the games and multi-media while waiting for our food.  Made the time go by so much faster... especially since the MM always cooks their pizzas to order and there can be a bit of a wait time.

The other thing I did not know was that each MM location has their own unique pies... so I definitely tried one of them:  The Boozer.  Beer cheese, Canadian bacon, bacon, mozzarella, and grilled chicken.... pretty darn tasty and great!

Our server Morgan was super attentive and nice and made sure we were totally happy during the whole experience.  I was even thanked by the host/tess table by 3 of their servers when I was leaving, which really makes for a nice way to end the meal (also another excuse to go back and hang out with really nice folks....)."}
{"text":"I was here twice during a weekend as lunch prior to a festival Uptown.  Rather than pay for expensive festival food and cheap beer, I figured this was a good opportunity to check out this Mellow Mushroom and their beer selection.

The restaurant decor lacks the funkiness of some of their other locations and is more trendy which is popular Uptown.  Gone is the MM soul with the funky characters surrounding the restaurant.

The first visit, I say at the bar.  They had just opened for the day and were still getting ready for the day so service actually seemed a little slow.  They have a huge beer selection on tap. You are bound to find something you like. For a meal, I went with a large greek salad. And let me tell you, it was quite large and very tasty but it was so large, I could not finish it. 

The 2nd visit, I sat in a booth at the front of the restaurant. Again, I caught them when they had just opened and apparently they clean the entire restaurant on Sundays around lunch time. They were cleaning the booths/tables around me and it was a bit annoying because it wasn't just 1 person, it was 6 and it was very distracting.  And then I went ignored. It took forever to get a water glass refilled and also forever to get my check.  I ordered the Magical Mystery Tour pizza this time around. It was loaded with veggies and I love MM's pizza dough but again it was huge and I could only finish half of the pizza.

The food is great here but both times there were service issues. Apparently cleaning and prepping here means you can ignore your paying customers.  Service is what stopped this from being a 4-star review."}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to try something new for lunch today and we ended up here.

Since I've been to the other Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn, this one had to live up to the expectations from that one.

The atmosphere was interesting.  There's a big mushroom light with booths underneath.  That's where we were seated.  There are mushroom characters around the restaurant.  The walls are bright and contrast nicely with the lighting.  The bar layout is interesting - circular with the alcohol on circular shelves in the middle.

There is a 2nd floor to this restaurant with a few more tables.  The restaurant is much larger than the Selwyn location and has a large outdoor patio.  

Food-wise, the menu is the same as the other location.  You have pizza, sandwiches, calzones and a few other options.  The best thing here is the pizza.  The dough is out of this world and sort of like a pretzel dough.  It doesn't just lay in your stomach after your meal either which is a nice thing.

Now for specifics...I ordered a custom pizza with jerk chicken, roma tomatoes, black olives, red sauce and mozzarella.  The jerk chicken overwhelmed the pizza.  It was covered in with it which I guess was to cover up the fact that there is apparently a shortage of roma tomatoes (4 slices) and black olives (I only saw one slice).

Service was good even though we caught them at the tail end of the lunch shift and our original server got called to other duties and another server filled in for a while.

I find this restaurant to be kind of sterile.  The mood that I'm used to with Mellow Mushrooms just isn't there.  But then again, this is Ballantyne.  You'd expect you could still find a little bit of funk in Ballantyne..."}
{"text":"I love that there is now a mellow in Charlotte! Ok so I am in between a 3 and 4 star for this location. I'd give it more of a 3.5 stars. The reasons are:
1. Very cute 60's disco like decor
2. There is even a car used as decoration inside the restaurant!
3. Excellent waiter/ staff services like other reviewers have said
4. Food arrived fairly quickly, but pizzas and subs and sandwiches shouldn't take too long to make
5. The biggest drawback for me is the food. We tried several subs here and they are all mediocre. This is so sad because I've definitely had better food at other mellow locations
6. I requested more mayo and ketchup for my sandwich and they were very willing to bring it out. My friend wanted a different flavor of chips and they brought out another bag for her while letting her keep her original bag.
7. All in all, if I were just to rate my dining experience, this place will be a 5. However, taking into consideration with the food, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Brooke, Bryan. And Marlena rock that bar, I can go 2 any number of spots within proximity, but I go 2 Mellow on PURPOSE EVERY TIME !
And it's all because of these 3 behind the wood !"}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time.  Looks spendy. $16.00 for a 10\" pizza....

Gonna see if it is big enough for 2 people.  
So, it's 10\" with a 2 to 3\" crust all the way around with no toppings. It's basically a 6\" pizza center.

So, a 10\" pizza with two iced teas is.......
$24.06

Too expensive and will NEVER be back.  Not even if it was free....."}
{"text":"We recently tried Mellow Mushroom once we saw that it finally opened after seeing the signs for quite awhile.  Part of our motivation was a coupon for a free appetizer that we received in the mail.  Headed there for a late lunch on a recent weekend.  Thought it would be crowded due to the lunch time hour, but we were able to get a seat quickly, with plenty of tables available.

We ordered the Capri salad as our appetizer.  This was okay...part of the problem was the tomatoes weren't great (I know, not in season right now), but the mozzarella they used was so-so at best.  The slices weren't very big either.  For our meal, we were going to share a half meatball hoagie and a small Kosmic Karma (pesto, spinach, sd tomatoes, feta) pizza.  (I must not have been listening to my wife, because we only shared the pizza, and I got all the meatball hoagie, score for me!)  I also ordered a root beer from the tap.  All of the food was very good.  I really liked the pizza, and the meatball sub was quite tasty as well.  Both also reheated well the next day in the toaster oven.  Other than the salad, the food was really good, and I'm looking forward to going back to try some other things.

The service was okay, still some kinks since they had just opened.  It was super friendly though.  One thing I might be apprehensive about if I were to eat there on a regular basis...it seemed like the prices were a little bit high...not sure why, but seemed like a huge jump in price from their small to their large pies...but they tasted good so they have that going for them.  Pretty sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Visited here Thursday night to place a to go order of pretzel bites and wings and sat at the bar and had a beer while waiting on the order.  Placed the order online and it was easy to do.  Greeted at the door by a smiling and happy host.  Took seats at the bar and the bartender quickly gave us a beer list and promptly delivered our beers, Sweet Baby Jesus, after ordering.  Took time enjoying the beer and witnessed a slightly belligerent and obviously drunk couple being upset over the time of their to go order, that they had only placed a few minutes before.  I watched the encounter and felt as if the Mellow Mushroom staff and management handled the situation extremely well.  I've worked in hospitality so I know how tense these encounters can be but I was impressed by the Mellow Mushroom staff.  Anyway, picked up my to go order and walked the 4 blocks home and my order was still warm and was very tasty!  I recommend this location for their service, ambiance and for the food!"}
{"text":"Came in to eat after working at the Marquee. Way over priced for the experience. None of the staff seemed happy to be working there. Our server was actually extremely rude. And not knowledgeable about any of the food or the beer. So we just left. I will not come back into this location. Too bad."}
{"text":"We stopped by to pick up pizza for take-home. Our usual pizza place had a line out the door, so we decided to give Mellow Mushroom a try. We drove a little west, placed our order and sat down to wait. The interior is fun and interesting- cool art, great tunes and very open. The staff was friendly and well-informed, answering many questions about the sauces, crusts, etc. The only downside is that the wait was FOREVER. If they were busy, I'd have chalked it up to that. But there were maybe 5 or 6 tables sat, and double that many people working, so I have no clue what took so long. All that said, we did like the pizza. It wasn't AS GOOD as our favorite, so I'm not sure we'll be back. We might give them another shot though, if the line at our fave place is out the door again ;)"}
{"text":"We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday with a 2 year old, understanding we would have to wait a while...we were told a 45 minute wait and we agreed to wait.  Surprisingly, though, we waited just 10 minutes.  They didn't have a high chair for our little guy so we settled for a booster, which is a big difference, but we could stand to be flexible given it was a busy night.   Once we sat down our waitress took our drink and appetizer order but then didn't come back for at least 10 min. (Someone brought out our appetizer and my husbands drink but not mine, which was from the bar).  Finally, our waitress took our order and then came back with my drink.  When she dropped off my drink she told us it would be an hour for them to cook our pizza.  At this point it was already 7:30 and our guy was growing restless.  We waited a few minutes longer and then told them we needed to leave and would have to have them box it up to go, which would still be another 30 minute wait.  We packed up our little one and sat in the parking lot (since we paid $60 for our entire meal) until they called to tell us our mea was ready.  Here's the thing.  I've worked in the service industry a while and would suggest they make some changes fast to avoid tarnishing their reputation...they sat us far too quickly and while we avoided the wait for a table, they overwhelmed the kitchen with orders and left everyone to sit (and order) without knowing there was such a long wait for food.  Their staff was too busy, perhaps with too many tables each, to handle it all.  So, now as first time guests, we likely won't return.  They need a manager in to handle the flow of traffic to lower overall wait time."}
{"text":"The pizza is absolutely delicious. While it's really not that hard to mess up pizza, it is hard to make it stand out. And Mellow Mushroom does it. We ordered their version of a meat-lovers pizza, and it was thick-crusted, greasy heaven. Absolutely amazing.

The restaurant itself is actually pretty neat as well. It's designed in a movie-type fashion, with excellent decor. Such as a King Kong bursting through the ceiling, an (as close as you can get indoors) life-size dinosaur grazing over the bathroom, and movie theater seats in the foyer. Very kid friendly.

We went on a Sunday afternoon, so it wasn't overly busy, but it wasn't absolutely empty, either. Our service was great out on the patio. And they have quite the beer list to go with your delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Love the food but giving two stars because of the wait. Arrived  at 7pm and it's 8pm and still no food."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. Staff were very careful and knowledgeable about gluten cross contamination. Felt fairly safe eating here. We had pizza and it was fantastic."}
{"text":"First off let me say the pizza was GREAT, but I have a couple of issues with the staff. My family ordered take out and my grandfather picked it up. NO ONE greeted him or asked if he had a pick up for TEN minutes while he stood by the front counter. Staff actually averted eye contact. This is a man in his SEVENTIES. Not only that, but when he finally got our order (two boxes of pizza) no one held the door open for him. He actually had to use his hip to swing the door open himself. Two staff were by the door, but no one had the respect to help the ederly. I am embarrassed my generation could treat anyone this way. My grandparents never want to come back, but I told them I would write a review and to try you guys again. Please teach your staff common courtesy. THANKS."}
{"text":"Went after work for a drink and snack to skip out on traffic. Sat in a booth for 13 minutes before being greeted. Server was very friendly and attentive when she finally came by. Ordered one beer and the pretzels bites. My favorite appetizer and it was delicious as usual. Their beer list is always spectacular too. Overall good experience and it would have been great if the 13 minute wait hadn't been a factor."}
{"text":"Gluten Free Review....
I am a celiac and after some research figured I would give Mellow Mushroom a try. It has been years since I have had a good pizza and MM hit the spot! The crust was delicious. I was a bit worried about the vegan crust but it had an authentic pizza crust taste with out any weird texture issues. Our server was very knowledgeable about the gluten free processes the kitchen uses and the manager made it a point to come over and talk about it also. I really appreciated the time and attention they gave to my food. I had no health issues after eating there and will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"A very big disappointment.  It really wasnt that crowded for a weekend and they were in the weeds all night.   Would give a one rating for the cold flavorless  pizza I received (after an hour wait,) except our server was extremely competent and told us up front that things would be running behind.  She really was excellent and did a great job so kudos for her.   She got a good tip.   I probably would have sent my cold pizza back except we had some friends stop by our table that said they had been told it would be at least 1 hour 50 minutes for their pizza.  I'm just confused because if they were behind you would think my pizza would be hot and fresh from the oven.   

I don't think I will want to go back.   

The management needs to pull it together.  The place was not what I would call crowded for a Friday night."}
{"text":"WOW. I don't think I've ever met nicer bartenders than the staff here at the mellow shroom shroom. Josh, Chris, Marlena, and Lissette really know how to make their people feel right at home whether their just out here chillllllin or on a serious date with that special somebody :)))) A+++ these are my ride or dies til I dies"}
{"text":"I just love their fresh crusts!  I add extra cheese, onions and sausage and I'm never disappointed.

Whether I eat in at the bar or get it to go... @mellowmushroom soothes my soul."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their pizza and wings!  Good crust on the pizza with fresh-tasting toppings & crispy, naked, wings!  

Interesting Tap Beer selections and Abita Root Beer on Tap, too!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza! Sometimes they can be slow, but that's because they are so popular. Casual atmosphere with a nice sized bar and plenty of TVs."}
{"text":"We wondered around up north and got hungry and came across the Mellow Mushroom. Thanks to a yelp check in we got free pretzel bites!

We ordered the house special pizza. It was a pretty standard supreme pizza. I can't say that there was anything that stood out about the pizza. We got the thin crust and it wasn't super thin, not crunchy. It's a slightly sweet crust. I think the toppings are too thickly cut for my liking, it's not bad but I think it's a bit pricey for what it is. We weren't starving so we just got a medium pizza and it did the job for us likely due the pretzels.

I actually dug the pretzel bits with the dipping cheese they were a little different. I'd actually order those again and opt for trying a different pizza. 

I went to Mellow Mushroom in Ahwatukee a few years prior and I remember getting the one with lots of Mushrooms and liking it but unfortunately I did not review it then. I believe that would be the holy shitake pie. So it's definitely worth coming back to try again but the pizza this time was a-ok in my book.

The venue and the staff were nice, so no issues there."}
{"text":"My family and I have always loved this place but after today we won't be coming back. We walked in to the hostess completely ignoring us, then after standing there for 2 minutes she looked up and sarcastically smiled and said hi. Then grabbed menus, took us to our table while not saying anything else on the way there. While we were eating we heard another customer complain about the same woman. When one of the employees told the hostess what the customer had said you could see the hostess mocking and acting annoyed about the complaint then laughing about it. Not a friendly or welcoming experience in anyway."}
{"text":"Great place to get premium craft beer, and delicous pizza! The servers are always very welcoming and will remember you and your order. great atmosphere for any kind of occasion and I would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I went here today with a my family that was in town....The service was VERY bad. It took a LONG LONG time to get the food and it was not busy at all. The food itself is overpriced and unfortunately not worth the money or the wait. This place needs to get its act together quick because it does not take close to one hour to prepare a sandwich!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a later Sunday night food spot. Everyone seemed closed, seriously EVERYONE..I dont get that in a college town. Luckily this place was open had cheap pizza by the slice.

The pizza is your pretty typical/plain pizza by the slice. Nothing to talk about there really. This is a pretty big restaurant though. Lots of seating. The bar area had a TON of beer on tap or in bottles. So thats pretty cool... unfortunately I wasn't there to drink."}
{"text":"Love the food here but love the staff just as much! Anthony is amazing. Super friendly and great attitude!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I think my last review of 3 stars really helped?  We finally came back after a month or so and was instantly greeted while we sat at the bar. The service was much improved! And I looked and there was 2 bar tenders and a bar back to help out. That really freed up the bar tenders. Very quick and efficient and even asked me if I wanted another drink when they saw my drink getting to the bottom. So I feel like mellow has earned another star back that I took. Hopefully they continue to improve and I'll give me last star back to reflect my once 5 star rating that I gave before. 

Oh on my last review the manager did respond and was open for a conversation. We never were able to talk on the phone but it was a nice touch with a personal email after my fair rating. I liked it."}
{"text":"I consider myself a Mellow Mushroom veteran. I have been going to the one on Happy Valley for years and try to hit all the new locations in the valley. I've been to the city north location before buts it's always been boring. Well that was way before our two most favorite bartenders were there, Jenna and her sidekick Joe. They were original bartenders of the Happy Valley location where my wife and I have become regulars. They were awesome and left manage other locations. Well I, glad they are close to home than before. Noe actually wasn't working at the time but Jenna took a photo of us and sent it to hi, and he recognized us in a heartbeat. Hard to do after not crossing paths for over a year!

Now that I know they are back we will be back more often. Plus the patio at this location rocks. Just has a cool vibe to it. 

Oh in a side note, we did order the mighty meaty pizza and it was equally as great as other mellows. What Was a little different was this location actually prints out their beer menu each day. Super cool and should start a Mellow Mushroom trend!!! Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. I don't recommend ordering to take out, especially on Saturday nights. 

I've placed an order at 6:30 pm for a 7:45 pm pick up and they called me to let me know that the order was going to be late. I came in and told them that was okay, and I offer as an alternative to come in and eat there instead of taking out, they said that was okay. I went home to pick up my son and came back to be seated to eat there and they said, they were sorry, but that they usually don't allow people whom order to go, to switch and eat their order in the restaurant instead. Of course, this was the answer I've got, after waiting for 25 minutes insight the restaurant.  I ended up leaving with no pizza, no apologies, no option to speak with their manager, nothing. Totally unacceptable customer experience."}
{"text":"Pizza Pie Palooza...whatever your taste, they've got a pie for you.  Lots of predesigned  selections, including a few only available at this location, but you can also craft your own pie or calzone according to what you like.  Salads are fresh, tasty and generous proportions.  Hoagies are served on fresh made buns and also are generously built and overflowing with tasty fillings. The shrimp Poboy is my favorite. Full bar but be careful if you want to watch a sporting event. They are a restaurant with a bar, not the other way around and you may not get to watch the finish if the game runs late as they close early. Parking in back makes it easy to get here and stay for awhile. Very cool eclectic decor with rock motif. You could come just to get some interesting camera shots, but I recommend trying the grub as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in as I walked by since I just moved from out of town and knew the chain from other areas. It didn't disappoint with good tap selection as well as pizza!"}
{"text":"I went back to this place after work to give this place another chance. I had the bruschetta and it was very yummy. Happy hour is pretty good here, but I am still upset about them not having wine! I also haven't tried their pizza since the first time so that is why I only gave it 4 stars. Also, service it good and they are very personable."}
{"text":"I've lived in Tempe for a long time and I've seen lots or restaurants come and go. I feel like the south end of Mill Ave is finally emerging from the icy grip of the Great Recession. (Remember, that part of Mill pretty much died in 2007-2008.) I'm happy to see new things bringing activity north of 6th Street. 

And it's a pizza/beer place with a psychedelic theme: graffiti art adorns the walls, the mascot is a mushroom, and all the names of desserts are double entendres. Tempe IS a college town and Mellow Mushroom will do just fine for these reasons. That and they say they will be open til 2 a.m.

The beer selection was extensive, although the beer I ordered off the menu wasn't available. No biggie. There were lots more to choose from.

I split a 10'' veggie pizza and it was loaded with veggies (and even tofu). I liked the dough, it's made with molasses so it has that darker flavor. The cinnamon sugar pretzels were great too. I took some home and they heated up just fine. 

It's a big space and I didn't feel cramped. The windows let in a lot of light and the views are pretty nice. Service was attentive and all the workers seemed to be trained to bus tables even if they were not \"their\" tables. A couple different people cleared plates and filled up my water and asked if I wanted more beer. 

They also have a little walk up section off 7th Street. And I liked the neon sign above the door. I don't eat a lot of pizza, but if I'm ever in the mood I'd go to Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Absolutely love coming here. Always good food. Always a good time. Kids love it. Calzone is my favorite"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom has a great laid back atmosphere & I've always had friendly service. I'm a big pizza snob & these guys don't hit the top of my list, but I do appreciate the variety they offer. Their Holy Shitake is probably my favorite veggie go-to. Their Mill location is typically fairly slow & great if you need a fast-ish sit down meal."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of the 'shroom, but I must say this location was great. The server was kind, the food was fresh and made to order, and you can see the pizza dough spiraling up and being hand tossed in the kitchen. I felt that the ingredients were very fresh! Plus they have a yelp deal for checking in :) 

VEGANS: the thai dye pizza with vegan cheese and curry tofu + tempeh will change your life!

VEGETARIANS: my mom loved the holy shiitake pie, and my dad loved his veggie burger! The portions are really generous--the burger basically had half an avocado on it :)

NOTE: We were able to find street parking nearby on a Saturday night and there was a ~30 min wait. Make reservations for Fri/Sat."}
{"text":"A little disappointed. Just got into town and looking forward to a delicious pizza and beer. All 3 beers that I asked for (some even sampled) were out; so bummed out! First 2, then after the 3rd, the manager came out, by our servers request. After explaining my disappointment and requesting a little break (happy hour pricing?=$2 off per beer), the manager made it seem like he was going to be fair...however, when I got the bill, about $100 later, no discounts or breaks considering their lack of availability of what was shown on the menu. For as many times as I've been here, this was the most disappointing. Server and food were good, but I would not go back for the lack of consideration by management."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours!

the look- Its kinda stark?, Im not sure if I want to use that but I will, when you walk in, seems dark. I always wander over to the bar and enjoy the open area and large windows.its always freezing in there bring a hoodie.

Tender of the bar- not bad but not fun and talkative either, so depending on your mood, could make or break you visit. Lots of brews on tap to choose from including Rouge dead guy ale.

Food- all of the food here is incredible, however the meatballs are out of this world ! dont leave without trying them.. don't you do it!! plus they are only 3 bucks on happy hour.

break it down Jess- simply great, wish it was closer to home."}
{"text":"Me and my wife love this place!! The food is kinda pricey, but they have decent portions and it is VERY filling. We always have leftovers. Fun atmosphere, and we always get great service."}
{"text":"Love coming here with the kids.  great salads, a gluten free dairy free pizza option for my little guy who cant have those.... Love it! My favorite is the pizza with candied jalepenios- really hot but soooo good.  The kids also like the bus in the middle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"good food bad service! recommend just doing take out!"}
{"text":"**Check-In when u arrive & receive an order of pretzel bites FREE** 

Well after sitting outside for an hour our waiter NEVER put my order in for a pizza. When he finally did I still got the pizza that i DID NOT ORDER! I want 2 give them another shot but it definitely WONT be at night."}
{"text":"It's a unique pizza dining experience. Very trippy and psychedelic inside. The specialty pizzas are great, I think I had a BBQ chicken pizza that was off the hook! It's hard to categorize it because it's not \"Chicago\" style or \"NYC\" style. They've got a great beer selection too. Good to grab drinks or dinner! DON'T GET TAKE-OUT ENJOY THE DINING EXPERIENCE HERE!!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is okay, a bit pricey but good. We went for Breakfast, after reading their gigantic banner Best Breakfast .. 

Excellent service, that is where the best ends. Do not go t a pizza joint expecting the best breakfast Denny's and Black Bear Diner are better the Wild Berry Diner should have that banner BEST BREAKFAST. Wonder can I demand my money back for false advertising? Just who gave them the Best Breakfast distinction? I am sure this is a myth ..  Stick with what you know PIZZA."}
{"text":"Heads up a 10 for 20 groupon means nothing if the service is SO HORRIBLE you leave with nothing. Don't know if the Pizza is good and the beer cold but the service has a lot of opportunity. Call in a pizza told it would be 25 minutes. Here is sit 20 after the set time with no pizza. And when I told the young man his I don't care attitude was less than impressive. So then he leaves for the back and comes out empty handed. I tell him I am done and he can have the pizza. He then says oh it's right here. So I respond with I have been waiting for 25 minutes for a pizza that has been done? He said yes an I said it is yours. What an incredible disappoint! I would give zero stars if possible. Absolutely Horrible!"}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to. We waited 15 minutes for a server to come to our table. Our pizza was extremely soggy, so when we asked our waiter for another, he told us we were no longer welcome. Good luck here."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great pizza.  Perfect for date night.  They even have some craft beers to try.

We had the Thai pizza, it is spectacular."}
{"text":"Great Happy hour. Munchies are half price price and drink specials from 3-6.
Bar seating is to a minimum especially if you have more than 2 people,luckily patio seating makes up for it."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for Happy Hour 3-7. Beer 2.75 and 1/2 price appetizers you can't go wrong!
We had the spinach artichoke dip and pretzel bites served with an incredible beer cheese sauce! Sat at the  bar and had great service."}
{"text":"Super slow, 45 minutes to get our pizza. I can see why there's not many customers right now. Service was good (thanks Sunny!) but it's over priced for what you get."}
{"text":"service okay  but more like from Mel's Diner. WEbsite doesnt show prices because theyre high for what you get. Pizza basically is poor. Chain/franchise stuff all zip and dazzle and poor quality. The  dough was flat almost like it had no yeast. The tomato sauce is sub par tasted like a jar of supermarket sauce on sale salty bitter not sweet and fresh. Cheese was definitely not high quality mozzarella. If any one  who has lived or eaten in NYC, LA, SF  Boston even Chicago tasted this junk, they would surely never go back as I  will not. A large 16\" cheese pizza was $15.99. Hint there are purveyors that sell gr8 pizza sauce and cheese sellers that sell fine qualityWisconsin cheese, and those only  cost another 50 cents a pie so why would this mellow place charge $15.99 for a pizza with less than great ingredients. I dont care what the price is but pleae make it quality right                                                                                                                                                                                   THe corporate web site which I used has NO prices I googled Mellow and got the main website only ythe local store menus have prices.  The dough was  flat no bubbles or rising?? Th sauce was sub par  Bonta( Escalon) makes a pizza sauce without the preservative citric acid which makes  sauce bitter not sweet. Their's tastes sweet like a tomato product should.. The bottom of our crust was very well done but the top of the pizza was  undercooked. ERven the to go box was  cheap  Sorry Jay   its overpriced  but inferior"}
{"text":"We popped in for lunch while shopping last weekend and had a great experience. The server was friendly and prompt. Three of us ordered salads and my fianc√© ordered the wings. The salads were amazing and I was very pleased to enjoy a free ceasar with the Yelp check-in offer. I added chicken and it did not disappoint. My fianc√© really enjoyed his wings and I had took leftovers home. This place hits the spot for a reasonably priced lunch with a group."}
{"text":"We had lunch here today and it was fabulous! The veggie calzone was amazing and plenty large to share. Our son had the old school jerk chicken sandwich and loved it. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Having lived off of one of the best Mellow Mushrooms in my college days, I am pretty picky when it comes to any other Mellow location.  Having said that, I still love mellow mushroom, wherever it is but can tell the differences immediately.  The sauce tasted sweeter than I remember but it was still good.  We split the lil' Caesar salad, ham & pineapple calzone & the honey-cinnamon pretzels.  All very good.  I also love their pizzas.  We usually get two calzones and take home leftovers because we love it so much.

It was a Tuesday night, apparently trivia night.  It wasn't too crowded, but most tables were playing along in teams.  They have many themed nights, so something to check out if you want entertainment with your meal.  

I loved the layout of the restaurant and bar area.  The decor is typical mushroom style.  Love the selection of beers on tap and always ask the server for the special taps not on the menu.  Our server was very knowledgable in helping us select a new brew to try and he was very nice and attentive.  

If you're in the area, stop and grab some great pizza.  If you're not in the are drive on down, it is worth it."}
{"text":"Well was excited to try out a new pizza place that offers gluten free pizza, but my enthusiasm quickly went out the door when I took my first bite. The only description I can give the pizza is \"Frozen Pizza from the grocery store. It really was pretty bad and expensive for the lack of taste it left in my mouth. The only thing I had to be thankful for was that I had a Groupon, so didn't have to pay full price for it. My daughter did order the kids macaroni and cheese and did say it was good. Needless to say we won't be returning for pizza. My husband ordered a regular pizza and he was not impressed either."}
{"text":"Good service great servers best happy hour around. Good chill place to relax amd have a beer.."}
{"text":"It is difficult to write a review of a restaurant where one has not tasted its food.  I have been here twice and have never been served!  The first time was on an extremely crowded Saturday night.  The outside patio, the bar, and the restaurant were completely full.  The inside was so noisy that earplugs were just about necessary, so I put our name on request for the outside patio.  They said 10 minutes for an outside seat.  I said that was fine.   After 20 minutes they never called us and the hostess was nowhere to be found so we left.  Also, the waiting area is RIGHT in front of the entrance door and people were constantly trying to get past us and everyone else who was waiting.  What a stupid setup!  The 2nd time we came here about 4:30pm on a Friday afternoon.  Hurray, no waiting!  We were seated outside immediately, however no one came to take our order after 25 minutes.  I left and we told the host about this.  They didn't seem to care.  Looking at the menu, the drinks are very overpriced here.  I won't come back to this place!  It is obviously mismanaged."}
{"text":"Service us usually pretty good. The pizzas are really good, with delicious crust. And their mushroom soup is really good Ndamukong unique. Happy hour is definitely the time to come for some late night cheap eats...wings!"}
{"text":"Hostess(s) did not greet us and i had to interupt their conversation to get them to seat us and they were visibly annoyed that i did so, and with a mostly empty facility they sat us next to a huge group of baseball kids and their wasted parents, covered in mud and smelling like body odor they were also obscenely loud and running around without shoes unsanitary and unacceptable for a restaurant. I gave this 2 stars because my previous experience here was positive.

Also our server was attentive and accommodating... but those hostesses got to go... i went up to ask them where the bathroom was and they didnt even stop having a conversation one of them just pointed over their shoulder without so much as a word of acknowledgement or a glance in my direction.

I was supremely disappointed and both me and my boyfriend were put in such a foul mood this really ruined what was an otherwise good day. 

*edit*
lowered to one star because when i approached the hostess to ask to be reseated (because we could not hear eachother over the drunk adults and out of control children) she acted like i was retarded and said that there were no other open spots which was untrue shewas just so engrossed in her conversation with her friend she couldnt be bothered... It made me so angry we had our server (who was excellent) box our pizza so we could leave.

We ate our pizza at home and it was delicious... its a shame that our experience at this restaurant was ruined."}
{"text":"First it's great to see something up in City North as this place is an absolute disaster since almost every store has closed down.  The place is comfortable and has a bunch of TV's around the bar area.  We made it durning happy hour and I like the half off appetizers that's a good deal and the chicken wings were ok.  I really got tired of the service people coming by every second and asking how we are doing etc.   A few times is cool but I think they came over around 10-13 times.  My kids had 1/2 sandwhiches and they seemed to like them.  I had a medium pizza and shared it with another person.  The pizza is ok but not great and it's really over priced.  I think a medium pizza was $20 dollars with one topping.  I could go to slices at Desert Ridge and get a large for $13 dollars or Barros for $9.99.  Beyond that I hope the place makes it but I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Yup...must go back!

Really, there are so many things on the menu that sound outstanding I have to hold off my final review until I get a chance to try more stuff.  I have been to Mellow Mushroom 3 times now and loved everything about it each and every time.

Great beer selection, awesome food, fantastic atmosphere.....love it.

Hopefully I will get to go again soon.  Did I mention I love this place?"}
{"text":"I have been ordering the same thing at various Mellow Mushroom locations for at least 8 years (if not longer). We are originally from GA/NC so are used to having a lot near by. Anyway, tonight (5/21) we were about an hour away from home but near this Mellow Mushroom so I thought it'd be great to get something to go since we don't have one by us. I called to place the order and the girl who answered the phone was completely rude and not only that, they refused to make my calzone. I have ALWAYS ordered a calzone with sauce and pepperoni inside it and no cheese. It's not a ton of sauce but there's a little bit. Well, she flat out refused to ring it up saying that they can't make it with sauce in it. She claimed to have asked someone to verify but I was barely on hold for 5 seconds so I think she was just pretending. Super rude and this location will never get our $$!

I've ordered it that way from two other AZ locations with no issues so why couldn't they do it? I will NEVER go back to that location and advise others not to visit them as well. Luckily, the Tempe location was kind of on our way home as well and they made it with no hesitation."}
{"text":"First time here and it was for a to-go order. Honestly, if I had know how bad the parking situation was, I would have gone to the Happy Valley location. That and the lack of staffing were my only negatives. I have food allergies, so my food normally is messed up other places, but my calzone was almost perfect! Needed a little more sauce but otherwise was good. 
This spot is perfect for an after work hangout and the bar area looked like a great place to unwind. I had stopped by on a Thursday afternoon (1/12) around 4pm and it was pretty dead but there were a few patrons at the bar. There were two people at the host stand that seemed too into whatever they were doing to let me know where to go to get my order. I ended up going to the bar to pick it up and even though he was busy, still took the time to make sure that my order was correct before I left. 

The main reason I don't know if I'll go back is the parking. There was no parking out front so I had to park behind the building and walk a bit to get there. Where I parked, there were a lot of cars with tickets on them and someone else even asked me if we were allowed to park there. I just said I wasn't sure but it looks like 2 hrs or less was okay. I don't want to go pay to eat somewhere and risk getting a ticket on my car too. But the food was great."}
{"text":"Even though my take out tonight wasn't as expected, I'll still give them another chance! This was my second time ordering from this location but I've been enjoying Mellow Mushroom for quite a few years from when I lived in GA and NC! Due to food allergies, I have them customize a calzone for me. Tonight it didn't even resemble a calzone and I haven't eaten it yet so we'll see how it is later, but look wise, it barely had any pepperoni in it and was a flat rectangle shape instead of the puffy, yummy looking calzone they normally serve. The first time I went I had ordered a few different calzones and everything was PERFECT though! Hoping that tonight was just a fluke and that the \"calzone\" tastes better than it looks. I live about 45min away so I didn't feel like waiting around to have it remade. I am a little surprised that both times I've been there, there's only been a handful of people in the restaurant. 

*Side note, I went to the bar to get my take out (like I did the first time) but I guess there is a special entrance for take-out's. There were 3 employees at the host stand when I got there and none said a word to me when walking in. So I got a nice little tour of the restaurant trying to find out where to go."}
{"text":"Yay! I'm a fan... sort of. The pizza is just average but their bar is amazing!  They had so many beers on tap, I could hardly believe my eyes. We sat down at the bar to wait and by the time I had made up my mind and ordered something our table was ready. Fortunately we were seated at a high top in the bar area so I could continue to gaze upon the beautiful array of beer taps and ponder my next beverage choice. Perennial options include choice beers from Deschutes, Magic Hat, Left Hand, Big Sky, New Belgium, Mudshark as well as local favorites San Tan and Four Peaks. But the really awesome thing was that they had a dozen or so rotating taps. Waitress provided us with a paper list of the seasonal choices but there were quite a few that I was not familiar with and being in the mood to try something new I sat patiently trying to catch the bartender's eye so I could ask questions. Our waitress came back and offered to help. After a few queries, I could see that she really knew her stuff. I have never met a server with so much craft beer knowledge before. Usually they give vague answers or else run to the barback to ask. She even gave me a couple samples to try. It was pretty cool.

I know Mellow Mushroom is a chain but I think it is neat that each location has it's own character. This one in Ahwatukee is decorated in a movie theme since they are across the street from the AMC. There was a giant King Kong and Hollywood signs... stuff like that. Overall it was a pretty cool environment. I liked the high ceilings because that kept it from being too loud. It was a lively atmosphere with a lot of chatter but because of the ceilings and the bar being open to the outside it never got annoying. We ordered a pizza that was half Kosmic Karma and half Mightly Meaty. Hubby thought his half did have enough meat on it but I was pretty happy with mine. I liked the sundried tomatoes and feta cheese... that added a slightly Mediterranean flavor. Their crust was soft and chewy and I believe they brush it with butter and sprinkle it with parmesan cheese. It sort of tasted like breadsticks. I'd have to say I think Spinatos or Nellos make better pizza but Mellow Mushroom was pretty good and I think a bit cheaper than either of those.

The funniest thing was that they whole reason we went there in the first place was that we had gotten a coupon in the mail but after a few beers we completely forgot about it. So, good news is now we have the perfect excuse to go back again!"}
{"text":"Perhaps a bit too spendy for the quality. However, they do have good food and excellent service. The best part about this restaurant is the selection of beer. They probably have the largest tap selection along the I-17/Happy Valley corridor."}
{"text":"Absolutely atrocious slow/bad service.We try on new restaurants in our area and always give them a little time after opening to settle in. Mellow mushroom in Mesa really needs service overhaul. We arrived around 7:30 PM and there was just a smattering of tables; it was rather slow. We waited at the host stand and were finally greeted not with any type of friendly hello but a simple blurt out of \"three\". Now welcoming at all. Host leads us to the table and menu drops and leaves without comment. Again not friendly. Maybe three or 4 min. of sitting at a server comes by and says he'll be right with us; however, that proved to be untrue as we sat just short of 15 min. no type of introduction, no explanation about the restaurant basically acted as a order taker. We ordered an appetizer and a couple of pizzas. He did not try to up sell the appetizer we had to ask him for it by calling them back to the table. Approximately 8 to 10 min. later our appetizer is served and we still have not gotten iced tea and lemonade that was ordered. Appetizer served before non-alcohol drinks is a joke. My 20 ounce draft beer came without a cocktail napkin which of course I hate because now it sweats and leaves a big puddle on the table. Hanger orange Wheat was cold and awesome tasting. We split a Caesar salad as an appetizer. We had asked for extra dressing in this was not brought out and we had to ask for it again. The salad itself was pretty good and had nice large pieces of shaved Parmesan. Once finished we placed the salad bowl and three plates at the center of the table. I had dropped my fork So I couldn't use it again. Pizza pies are delivered by a food runner who basically just dropped the pies and left without asking if we needed anything. Frustrating. It's like one of those times where you have your index finger up and her saying \"excuse me\" and they just walk away and now you know you're screwed because your server has been nonexistent since the beginning. Which turned out to be true as we waited 10 to 12 min. before he walked by not to do a check back but to service another table and I had to wave them down and ask him for a plate and a fork. In my opinion their pizza is far too oily to you with your hands and it was rather frustrating to sit there that long staring at pizza and not being able to eat. Stupid. The pizza itself was fair to good. I thought the sausage on the pizza was high-quality. My girls like the pies I thought they were just okay and to doey and under-cooked for my liking. When finished server did an automatic check drop without asking for anything else. My girls are the easiest sale on the world for dessert. Oh well. Long checkout time. Appetizer and dinner plates never bused away. Sloppy table. We got up to leave and passed four employees on the way out - no one say goodbye. The bartender actually looked up and gave us direct eye contact and still did not say goodbye. I realized that I had left my cell phone on the table. I past employees going back in and going back out and again no one say goodbye or anything else socializing among themselves instead.Too many places in this area to get pizza that are better tasting and certainly are served with better talent.I asked my wife if we would ever go back and she said, \"the only way I would go back is if the school had a function there. That service was far too painful.\" I agree.

Robo-Respose from Management: 
Comment from Mellow A. of Mellow Mushroom
9/14/2016 Thanks for this detailed (and helpful) feedback. Please accept our apology for serving you so badly. Sounds like we were off our game - what you experienced is not our . I do hope we see you again and I hope to hear that your next experience with us is perfect

No thanks, you won't. Really wish I had read the Yelp reviews before spending money here. What he calls \"typically great service\" certainly isn't reflected in this establishments past Yelp reviews, and \"off our game\" seems more of the norm than not. Restaurants need three things to be successful - miss one of them and you're doomed. 
Great ambiance   
Great Food  
Great Service X"}
{"text":"This place is well executed when it comes to the ambiance and service from Samantha but from that point on.......Bye Felicia.....lol....had too!!! 

Low quality average \"Mellow\" pizza.

Ciao"}
{"text":"Good food (Beer cheese is great) and service has never been an issue. The only reason for the 3 vs 4 star is the absence of Prankster in the beer menu. I know I'm being a beer snob but they spoiled me with at least one choice of a Belgian (Prankster) which they've not had my last three visits. The other location at High Street has 2-3 Belgian beers always on tap however, this location is more convenient. I know first world problems but the drink is just as important as the food imo."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times (the first of which was a REALLY long time ago), and I really like it.

It kind of reminds me of a not-so-chain-feeling California Pizza Kitchen, which I know is a weird thing to say because 1) I know it is a chain & 2) I like California Pizza Kitchen (and have no issue w/chain restaurants to begin with), it's just that Mellow Mushroom has a slightly more \"homey\" feel to it. 

A couple things I didn't know about Mellow Mushroom until this last time I went, but I'm glad I know now:

1) They have a a happy hour. Half price on apps & drink specials. 

2) They actually have a really good beer selection! I always expect chain places like this to carry pretty standard fare, but they actually have a really big variety here. A friend of mine who I came with is doing gluten-free right now and they actually had multiple selections for her.

As far as food goes, I had hummus and a pizza. I'm pretty easy to please with hummus, and it's good a Mellow Mushroom. Nothing stands out about it (for better or worse), but it's good. I also had a gluten-free pizza, which was delicious. I know nothing about gluten-free & since this was the first time I had pizza from Mellow Mushroom I have nothing to compare it to, but I really liked the crust in particular.

Service was fine (it wasn't all that busy), and they validate parking (I really hate what the parking situation on Mill has become, which is why I rarely frequent there anymore). 

I'm a fan, and I 'll be back."}
{"text":"Had the shiitake pizza pure heaven!!! Husband had the steak and cheese calzone and he was more than happy! We will be back! Thanks Groupon!"}
{"text":"I was recently invited to check out Mellow Mushroom at its Selwyn Avenue location in Charlotte. Although I have seen Mellow Mushroom locations in both Charlotte and Atlanta, somehow I had never before tried it. There are actually locations in more than 15 states including another Charlotte location in Ballantyne. The Selwyn location of Mellow Mushroom boasts a large bar and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating including a groovy decked out school bus with booths inside! Although the focus is on pizza, the menu varies including Greek, Caesar and Chef salads as well as an option to create your own salad with all sorts of protein and topping additions. Additionally, a large number of hoagies are offered such as jerk chicken, mushroom club, spiked sausage and shrimp hoag'boy. Vegetarians will find plenty of options including 5 veggie hoagies - the tempeh came highly recommended - and lots of salad and pizza options. Munchies such as the famous pretzels, stuffed portobello mushroom, meatballs, wings, hummus and Muffuletta cheese bread round out the mix. Pizza and calzones are offered in specialty varieties and their is an option to build your own as well.

We started with bruschetta, a nicely executed version with basil and feta served on crisp garlic toast points with balsamic glaze, definitely a solid choice. Our wonderful waitress also recommended the stuffed portobello mushroom, which I will have to try next time. For pizza we opted to try 4 different specialty varieties by ordering half and half on 2 10\" pies. The pizza is not too thin or too thick - a nice medium body crust - and you can tell it is fresh. I also enjoyed the addition of cheese around the crust's edge.

At this location only, there are three location-specific specialty pizzas available. We tried both the Black and Blue: olive oil and garlic based pie topped with blackened steak, crumbled bleu cheese, mushrooms and onions and the Umami (my personal favorite): candied jalepeno slices, pineapple, Applewood smoked bacon, fresh mozzarella, feta and caramelized onion, topped with basil. Wow, need I say more? Umami is considered to be the fifth taste - savory - which includes such a good combination of the four other tastes (sweet, sour, salty and bitter) that it requires its own unique name. The word comes from Japanese and means \"pleasant savory taste\".

We also tried the Holy Shiitake Pie, which includes Shiitake, button and portobello mushrooms, caramelized onions, mozzarella and Montamore cheeses with garlic aioli and black truffle oil on top. This was a close second for me - definitely a lot of great mushroom flavor and the aioli really adds an extra special touch. The Red Skin Potato pie, our final pizza selection was tasty although I would ask for the sour cream and spicy ranch on the side next time as I felt they overpowered the delicious potato flavor. This pie also has bacon, caramelized onions, cheddar and mozzarella - yum!

We tried a salad as well - the Enlightened Spinach Salad, which includes feta, dried cherries, apples and pecans. The homemade signature Esparanza dressing was delicious - definitely a must try and also good with pizza crust! We also tried the tempeh hoagie - a good flavor and lots of veggies make this a wise choice for the non-meat eating crowd.

For dessert we ordered the pretzels with honey/cinnamon sugar and the chocolate chip cookie. The pretzels (also available as a starter with garlic butter and parmesan or with butter, salt and mustard) are made from the pizza dough and are absolutely delicious. I had to get these and the cookie to go since I was already stuffed but I'm glad I tried them - definitely a treat.

Mellow Mushroom is a fun place for the entire family. Live music and trivia are offered weekly and the patio will be perfect for the upcoming fall weather. I suggest you give Mellow Mushroom a try. Let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"Jay (the owner) just sent me lovely email offering to compensate with a gift card for all 4 people that could not use their Groupon due to the misunderstanding. Now THIS is great customer service. Thank you!! I received the coupon a few days later. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I have an idea... If you want fast instant pizza, go to little ceasars... If you want your pizza to taste good go to M squared... \"my pizza took long!?!?\" waaaaahhhhhh"}
{"text":"I could write a long review and one day I will.
But for now....
Best bar in the city.
Period.
Joe and Jenna are any owners dream, a patrons savior and just good peeps."}
{"text":"I just went and sit for an hour ..Long wait for just a pizza. Server told me its about 15 min wait then after 30 mins I asked to follow up not done yet... then again I asked the lady serving says it coming up soon and after an hour nothing came to the table... And I walked out with my order to go already paid because ill be late for work.. I told the lady in the front that I will just pick it up later, who was by the way apologetic but hopefully when I come pick It up later it is not gonna be the same wait...disappointed!hungry customer!"}
{"text":"I've been to Mellow Mushroom in other cities, and was excited when I found out one was opening in Charlotte.  My husband and I decided to go there last night for dinner to check it out.  

Pros:
Food is yummy!  Our pizza and calzone were delicious!

Cons:
Service is crap-  Our server barely spoke to us and when he brought us our drinks he sat there and held them waiting for us to take them out of his hands??  Weird..  I was in the middle of eating my salad..??  He was the most unpleasant person I've met in a while.  

Way too many kids!  I saw a couple comments about this below as well, so I know it's not just me!  It definitely felt like Chucky Cheese!  It was loud with kids yelling and screaming and running up and down the aisle.  Whatever you do, don't let the server seat you in the bus if you don't have kids!  That is the like the Chucky Cheese playground! Eeek!

Overall,  good place if you don't mind being surrounded by kids.  Food is good, and service needs some serious help!

We might go back, but we'll definitely be sitting at the bar next time!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Met up with some family tonight and thought we'd give this place a try since we've heard such great things about other locations. We ordered the pretzels and cheese which absolutely did not live up to the hype; the pretzels were just bread sticks shaped into twisted pretzel shapes. They lacked any and all characteristics of a pretzel. Not chewy, not boiled... we specified \"salt\", too, but I couldn't detect any salt. They were blah pretzel-shaped breadsticks. And the cheese sauce (for $3.49 extra) was lukewarm with a skin on it and was totally bland. 

I ordered a cheese calzone with pepperoni, tomatoes, and basil. It made it to the table (five to ten minutes before any of the other entrees) without the requested pepperoni. I dug in anyway and wow, talk about a blah-stravaganza. They must use the cheapest cheese they can possibly find-- it tasted like nothing. Like flavorless glue. Like generic skim milk cafeteria cheese. The calzone crust reminded me of uncooked wheat sandwich bread. It was really bad. I tried to doctor it up with salt, pepper, red pepper, and parmesan (anything on the table, basically), ate maybe four bites and set it aside. 

My husband ordered a side salad with blue cheese dressing, so obviously it arrived with ranch dressing. He also ordered a small BBQ chicken pizza, ate two slices, and gave up. He and I shared a to-go box out of habit but we literally threw the whole thing in the trash when we got home. Neither one of us wanted to revisit those meals. 

Another person we were with ordered a pizza-- half Gourmet White and half Magical Mystery Tour-- and she literally ate like three bites. Her husband ordered the avocado sub and only ate half. We all looked around at each other and admitted everything was subpar. And we never say that! We're honestly not that picky, but usually if one little thing goes wrong we'll just blaze ahead and fake complete satisfaction. Not tonight. 

Service was okay, not stellar. Aside from getting several points of our order wrong, our server (though she did, to her credit, visit our table five or six times over the course of our meal) neglected to ask about bar drink refills until we'd already finished our meal. I could've used another beer after the appetizer, not as I was gearing up to leave. And the rest of the table felt the same. 

Overall I'm pretty disappointed. I won't be back. There are too many easy, similarly priced options in the Valley for great pizza (LGO, The Parlour, I'm looking at you) to condemn myself to this again."}
{"text":"Unique pizza, interesting atmosphere. Good service. Not to much to say about this place but they do deliver to my complex."}
{"text":"Started with the \"pretzels\" and beer cheese - a-mazing - also got a half order of wings very tasty but not very hot (temperature) but delicious none the less. House calzone was fantastic - so full from the starters I have HALF to bring home! Overall great experience, friendly staff, delicious food!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great for a restaurant of this caliber. 

The waiter I had the night I went, glasses, kind of heavy, tall and young, was awful. And that is what makes or breaks it for me. I'm a great cook and could have stayed home and had a better meal. But I like to go out every night. 

Nothing came out as ordered. 

I ordered a salad with ranch and balsamic. Only balsamic came. 

My dinner companion wanted something other than chips as his side and was offered celery and carrots. The sandwich came out with chips. 

In my entire life, I've never, ever had to pay extra for pickles on a sandwich. Which I asked for on my steak and cheese. 

I had to actually look inside the sandwich to see that there were pickles in there. There were. Maybe 5, total, in a large steak and cheese. It was supposed to also come with lettuce and tomato, neither of which were on it. 

Yet, when the bill came, there was a 99 cent charge for the pickles. 

I ordered a drink, Arnold Palmer and was never offered a refill. Nor was my water refilled without me having to ask. 

Awful, awful waiter."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in Mellow Mushroom for lunch. I used to live in Atlanta for several years and was well familiar with the chain. I don't recall visiting any Arizona locations in the past, and this location was built just a few months ago, so certainly my first time here. The weather was beautiful and they had a nice outside bar seating section. The other side of the bar was also enjoyed benefit from the open air. I decided to go with a pepperoni and mushroom calzone.

I knew the food was good and it certainly lived up to the expectations. What really surprised me was the bar and the not only the number of craft beers, but the number of exceptionally good ones. Over 40 taps of draught beer and an excellent selection of bottles. Stouts are my favorite and they have a great selection that day from Prairie Artisan Barrel Aged Bible Belt, to Big Bad Baptista, Elevation Cinnamon Oil Man, to a variety of other styles. They also have a happy hour that I would love to check out the next time.

If you are looking for a great pizza and an incredible selection of beer (and draughts coming in at 16oz and 20oz), this is the place!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!!! AVOID THIS PLACE!!! I ate 3 slices of a large mega veggie and was sick for 2 days. The Manger was nice but otherwise the staff I dealt with when picking up my pizza was bad at their job. I should have known better when I saw that it was rated 3 stars I usually avoid anywhere with less than 4 stars."}
{"text":"I'm not sure of the purpose of the response from the person above, but no mixed drinks were ever offered to us. We were also made aware that frozen drinks are also not available.  Interesting for a bar?

Also, I didn't mention it took over 45 minutes to get our food. 

Normally when people response there is more dialogue regarding the review."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I have been Mellow Mushroom fans for a few years and often look for one when on vacation and in need of a pizza night.  We have eaten at MM in various locations including Orlando, Myrtle Beach, and the Selwyn location in Charlotte.   Since we have a couple of local pizza places that we really like and often order pizza on a whim, we really don't think of MM when we are looking for pizza at home.  Until that last night, that is!!!   There were 4 of us (me, husband, teen son, and my Mom... who had never been to MM) and we all loved the food, the atmosphere, the service, and the balloon creations.  We got there before the Saturday dinner rush and we were seated right away.  The decor is typically MM style in updated form so the colors and vibe are fantastic.  

My Mom was going to have a salad instead of pizza until we all said that she was CRAZY to even think of such a thing!  Boy, what she glad we talked her out of it!   The boys ordered the House Special Pizza (minus ham and black olives) and my Mom and I ordered the Holy Shitake Pizza.  Although medium-sized pizzas would have been enough, we all look forward to leftover pizza for breakfast so we went with the large pies.  My son also had a small Caesar Salad and it enjoyed it very much.  The pizza took approx 25 minutes to arrive at the table and it was well worth the wait!  They were both piping hot, smelled fantastic, and looked gorgeous!  (See pictures)  Both pizzas were incredible, but the Holy Shitake Pie is off-the-hook crazy wackadoo delicious!!!!  A fluffy, buttery, parmesan cheesy crust topped with a magical blend of garlic, gourmet mushrooms, and garlic and baked golden grown.  Then, to make it even better (as if that was even possible), they drizzle the pie with a garlic sauce, too.   YUM!!!!!   The pie is totally crave-worthy and will be solely responsible for all of my future visits to MM!  My Mom absolutely loved it too and we both went as far as to say that it was one of the tastiest and most delicious non-traditional pizzas that we have ever eaten.  I don't know why we never tried this one before?!?  In the midst of my cosmic mushroom bliss, I did manage to have a bite of the House Special pizza and it was quite good, too!  The bite that I had Applewood Smoked Bacon, Ground Beef, and veggie and it was very tasty!  I'm not typically a fan of ground beef on pizza, that bite changed my opinion.  The boys loved their pie, too!

The server was very attentive and quite personable.  The Manager stopped by to say hello, too.  We were even greeted by a Balloon Creation Specialist (I just totally made that name up, BTW).  He was very friendly and quite talented.  Since it was dinnertime on a Saturday night, there were tons of kids in there (who were actually all all quiet and well-behaved from eating delicious pizza...bonus!!) the Balloon Man was making tiaras, motorcycles, swords, etc.   Then he came to our table and things went a little bizarre (in a good way).  He asked my 14 yo son what he wanted and my son made the mistake of saying \"anything will be fine\".  Mr. Balloon Man's eyes lit up with excitement and he got started on a Pink and Red swirled hat with a 2 ft antennae and a giant powder blue heart attached at the end.  Luckily, my Son has a great sense of humor and is very easy going...I don't know that all boys would have taken so kindly to it.  It was quite funny!  (see picture)

What I really like about MM is the quality of the ingredients that they use.  Their crust is made is unbleached wheat flower, their meats are flavorful and delicious, and many of their toppings are organic.  If you're a die-hard NY style pizza lover, then MM is not for you.  But, if you enjoy a fluffy, flavorful, and buttery crust with excellent toppings and tasty sauces, then you must give MM a try!  

So...after reading this glowing review, you're probably wondering why only 4 stars instead of 5?  There is one reason, and one reason only....the price.  For 2 large pies, 1 small salad, and 2 soft drinks the bill came to $63.00!  Yes, the food was excellent.  Yes, they use high quality ingredients.  Yes, the experience is lively and fun.  BUT, the practical side of me says that $63.00 for 4 people to eat pizza is just plain crazy!!!   Will it stop me from going back again?  Heck NO, but MM will be a \"once in a while\" pizza outing and won't make it to our in-a-pinch pizza list.  

As a side note, I just re-heated a leftover slice of Holy Shitake in the oven and had it for breakfast (yes, I am NOT too proud to admit that) and it was just as delicious as it was last night....maybe even better since it caused the garlic sauce to melt into the pizza a bit.  Sadly, there's only piece left now and it's \"supposed\" to be my Mom's slice.  We may have to arm wrestle for it...and, yes, I'm not too proud to admit that either!   LOL"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to spot for late night eats. That is until the other night when I went in there with a friend and we sat a table. A man came over and told us that we could sit at the bar or we couldn't get service. I told him we didn't want to sit at the bar (I don't drink) and would prefer to eat at a table. He said no way and was rather rude. So we left and went to Zipp's right down the road. It's too bad that the help they have is rather rude and not accommodating...I really like the food, but with bad service, I'll pass."}
{"text":"We are creatures of habit when we show up to mellow mushroom. Our go to appetizer is consistently the meatball trio, pretzel bites, and of course Thai chili wings! Yesterday we were especially hungry after a day on the lake so we ordered a large pizza to be able to have leftovers. Service was crazy fast and he was so friendly and bubbly especially for being a Sunday evening. We are regulars at the ahwatukee location and this location proved to be near perfect also.
I cannot get enough Thai chili sauce so make sure to order one on the side to dunk your pizza crust in, you can thank me later!"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is adorably kid friendly in our opinion and is casually a great dinner for pizza nights. 
However, last night they upset me. 
From the parking lot we see 3 hostesses all chatting at the booth, my husband, our 4 year old son, 5 month old daughter (holding in car seat) and I were walking up and they stood there as if we were interrupting an important conversation. 
Nowadays when we eat at restaurants and taverns it seems like if it's not busy the hostess usually open the door. Let alone 3 hostesses just chatting.
Food and drinks are always amazing and delicious, which keeps us returning! 
Servers are always sweet but our favorite server Patrick no longer works there. 
I appreciate great customer service and recognize and compliment it when I see it but when it really underwhelms for common sense purposes it's easily fixable! 
Thanks for being our Friday night family date night!"}
{"text":"Pretty busy place so far. Just opened. I sat outside as it is a beautiful day and I better do this now before the heat comes. My waitress Heather took good care of me. I got a 16oz North Mountain Grooving with a Pict and a small Mega-Veggie pizza. The North Mountain was great with a mellow taste and bite. Everyone was very nice and it was extremely clean. The music was good and not too loud (80s-today's pop). They have a full bar and the decor of the place was wonderful. The pizza was delicious. I don't think I have anything to complain about. Not even the price! Haha good job Heather!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I fell in love with the ambiance. I love the outdoor charm & feel. We ate outside & it was perfect. The pizza was great- loved the veggies!! The cheesey garlic bread was awesome! The service was slightly slow & our drinks were continually empty, but the waitresses were friendly. Excited to come back & try more of the salads & appetizers!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Bloody Mary drinks during happy hour. I also enjoy their vegetarian pizza options. The atmosphere is very fun with colorful urban art including skateboards as canvases. Fun place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"Like many people have already mentioned, besides the pizza, the food is very bland. Got the ribeye sandwich and it left me unsatisfied. The beer selection is great."}
{"text":"Went for the first time a few weeks ago on a Saturday afternoon. Got right in without a wait. The pizza was amazing! We tried two different kinds of pizza. We got the Holy Shiitake Pie and then we created our own with the their red sauce. Both were amazing. The crust is out of this world and very unique in flavor. I preferred the Holy Shiitake pie over the one with the red sauce because it is so unique and I do not feel you can get this anywhere else in our area! We have already went back to order carry out. With so many pizza places around town it is nice to see a place which offers so much variety of pizza options. Very unique and hip place! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So glad a location is opened in uptown! Great pizza, beer selection, very friendly staff. I have had a number of different pies, and was never disappointed. Start with the house special and go from there!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were waiting for the opening of this location. We lived in the area last year and were disappointed as restaurant after restaurant closed in the area. Now let me state up front that I have always been a Mellow Mushroom fan. From the days of the early MMs that went bust about 4 or 5 years ago, to the locations in Greenville and Atlanta. So, giving this location on 3 stars was not easy... because I really went in hoping I would be giving them 4 or 5.
We went on a Wednesday night and as expected with most new popular restaurants, there was a long line. Our wait was supposed to be 25-30 minutes and turned out to be about 45. 
When we sat down, we waited almost 10 minutes for a waiter to show up. We had two children with us and ordered the PBJ and Mozzarella Meatballs for them. My wife and I ordered the Pizza. We all ordered sodas. The sodas for the kids did NOT come with lids. Now I'm not sure if YOU have ever gone to a restaurant with a two year old, but a drink with a straw and no lid is a recipe for disaster! One point lost there. 
The kids meals came out after about 20 minutes. Both came with apples and the meatballs came out just right... not too hot for those little fingers and mouth, but warm enough that the cheese was still melted. One point plus there.
The problem was this, the Pizza didn't come until a full 25 minutes after the kids meals! They were done eating, the two year old was ready to hit the road and Mom and Dad were JUST starting to eat. Two points lost there!! 
The pizza was their special. Although it was good... it wasn't special. I couldn't say that there was anything special about it... just average. 
Hence my rating. At this point, I would say that the restaurant is NOT child friendly. And to be honest, it wouldn't take a lot to get them to a place where I could say the restaurant is child friendly. They need to work on that.
The servers seem confused, at best. The people beside us waited 45 minutes for their Pizza.... and I thought that was a little long for a Pizza. 
So I wouldn't say no to going again... I will say that it will take me a while to go back. Hopefully they will work out the \"kinks\" by then."}
{"text":"The pizza is surprisingly good and they have rogue dead guy ale as well which is a mean feat in these ol carolinas.

Umm. Anyways don't fear the potato pizza, it's good and you'll like it."}
{"text":"Five stars for all of the cheap college students out there! 

if you are looking for the BEST happy hour in Tempe, THIS IS YOUR PLACE. Half off appetizers, and they are all great. I suggest the garlic bread because it is about one dollar for a large loaf. Also, drinks are half off!

IT GETS BETTER. THEY HAVE A REVERSE HAPPY HOUR
You can get half off drinks and appetizers from 10-2! 

BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE.

there isn't but I wanted to continue with the infomercial theme."}
{"text":"My wife and I are on a low carb diet, so we rarely eat out saving it for when we want to take a break from low carb. This time we decide to go to Mellow mushroom. We had not been in a while and I was missing their french bread Tapenade (which they longer have) When we arrived @ 3:00 pm on a Saturday, there was maybe 6 to 8 cars in the parking lot. Being hungry we thought great we will get right in. We went in and there was a group of about 8 people sitting there and no one at the host station.
   We sat down and waited. About 5 minutes goes by and nothing. My wife went in and got someone who seemed to be annoyed to be bothered by the look she gave her and saying someone will be there soon. Are employees not trained to acknowledge when people are kept waiting to apologize for the wait? 
  We sat for another few minutes and then we were seated, We chose the patio with only 2 other tables occupied. A few more minutes past and Kirsten a very pleasant young lady came out and took our drink order and pepperoni cheese bread and was soon back with our drinks at that time she took our order for our entree a steak salad , a good 10 minutes later she came out and asked if we gotten our bread?  We said no and then another 5 minutes she came back with it. it was another 10 minutes before we got our salad by the way there was not salt or pepper on any of the tables and the table was not the cleanest.
   We did not see her until we were almost done with our meal, and my cup almost empty at that point, asking if I wanted a refill I declined as I had only a few more bites, At $3.29 a glass, that seems very very steep for one glass of soda. Knowing that we were almost done we finally had to ask another server for our check which was another 5 minutes before we go it. Knowing when we arrived and looking at the time stamp on the check it literally took an hour for this meal with maybe 7 to 10 tables in the whole restaurant filled.

 Reading over the 2 and 3 star reviews on Yelp it seems that service is the main issue with this restaurant when it comes to low ratings, and that issue lies with management. Giving the same response over and over on yelp from the manager again and again rings hollow when nothing is being done about the issue. Had this happened on a busy Friday night this would be totally forgivable and not requiring a review but on a slow Saturday afternoon after the lunch time rush is inexcusable.

You might want to brief your servers that good service equals good tips. You really have to not try to get a 10% tip from us she succeed here.. She could have easily gotten 20% had she put some effort into it .

With that said, the food was excellent, and hot and fresh. The steak was cooked perfect. Would have been much better though with some salt and pepper. I think we will try the one on Stapley next time as both places are the same distance from our house."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I first came here for a late dinner on a Friday night. We were seated quickly and were offered up samples of the beers they had on tap &  recommendations for the food from our chill server. She also let us know that you can split the toppings for the pies- half & half!  It's two pizza's in one! I love this because I'm indecisive as hell. We got half Maui Wowie and half Magical Mystery Tour.  Though both pizzas were tasty, the pesto on the Maui Wowie really wowed me! The Mellow M uses a wheat crust, fresh ingredients, and offers a lot of options for vegetarians. With all the healthy ingredients, I was worried my pizza craving was going to be met with a cardboard \"healthy\" pizza, but these pizzas can stand their own against any greasy pies. Plus, i felt better about the integrity of the food I was eating.

It's trippy-hippy decor is way far out man!  This is being added for my BF: If you are a dude, you HAVE to use the bathroom here. Apparently, the urinal has a one way mirror for you to look our at the rest of the place? He loved this... he's also really tall so many not everyone can see out.

The second time we went was a Sunday afternoon. We were greeted by another laid back waiter. We ordered a stuffed mushroom as an app (delish!) and the house calzone. We were told \"Everyone loves that calzone. It's the best!\" I had one bite of the calzone and couldn't eat it. It had SARDINES & OLIVES & MUSHROOMS. We couldn't remember exactly what was on the house calzone, but we couldn't believe THIS was the most popular calzone that everyone loves. Sure enough, they had brought us the wrong calzone- But the house 'zone was out quickly once we pointed out the mistake. I don't know what dude was starting their Sunday that fishy/briny mess of a calzone... they obviously had a rough Saturday night- but the house calzone was really nicely balanced with basil, tomatoes and mushrooms. Even though the wrong order came out at first, the Mellow M made up for it. We were not charged for either of the calzones!"}
{"text":"Would've liked to give this place 5 stars but the wait for the pizza was terrible. I think we waited about 45min after ordering our food before we got it to the table. 

The reason I'm still giving 4 stars is that our server was super nice (not that knowledgable though for what they had) and the food was delicious. We got 2 different pizzas and loved both of them. We also got the pretzel/cheese appetizer... Not so good in my opinion. We liked the general hippie vibe of the place and its theme. We will be back, but perhaps to order in before we show up. Not sure what the problem was.  It was busy but not packed."}
{"text":"The best pizza ever- the fun guy!  The spinach and artichoke dip is great, too! Half price drinks for happy hour."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this restaurant. I would think a restaurant with this name would have an awesome portabella mushroom sandwich. It consisted of a few thin slices of mushrooms(not enough to taste) and lots of lettuce. Ordered a side upgrade of roasted potatoes that were undercooked. Told the waitress and she did nothing about it. Service slow when half the place was empty. Won't return. One good thing: the decor is very cool."}
{"text":"Mellow mushroom is a good pizza joint. It's not something so amazing I would plan a date to go to though. I would say it's great if you want a step above fast food pizza but not to the gourmet level- like wood fired etc. It is fun to go for a late night drink at the bar and get pretzels because they are, in my opinion, the best things there. Mellow mushroom is a chain restaurant, and chains aren't really my thing."}
{"text":"Cool Athmosphere for children, We didn't enjoy their pizzas that much. But good place to hang out"}
{"text":"Really good crust on their pizza and calzones!  The sauce was fantastic and they aren't stingy with the toppings.  When we came in we ordered the House Special pizza and had them leave off the black olives- it truly was a beautiful pie.  We also had a calzone, wings and the meatballs.   I ate the rest of the calzone the next day and it was just as memorable reheated.  The garlic butter on the crust was so heavenly...

The interior is older, and an oddly strange dinosaur and gorilla are part of the decor but I'm guessing this building used to be something else and they just kept them there?  Either way, the atmosphere is very kicked back and comfortable.   

They had an awesome draft special that I didn't take advantage of but next time I definitely plan to.   

There was a lot of leftover pizza and calzone which is always great- especially when it was so delicious. Definitely a good place to get great pizza!  I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"$60 for 2 pizzas that were mostly unadorned dough. Hardly any toppings at all, like 3 thin slices of tomatoes on a large pizza. Half of one of the pizzas was only dough with no sauce or toppings at all! And for $30 a piece you'd hope you were getting all 3 toppings you ordered, but we did not and had to drive back and wait around for a new one. Yes, yes I know the decor inside is cute, but so what?!?! I can't eat the bus or decorations! Don't waste your time or money, just down the road is Portofinos and they know how to make pizzas. We only came here because we do not eat dairy and Mellow Mushroom does offer vegan cheese. Next time we'll just order from Portofinos or Hawthornes and add our own Daiya cheese at home. They're getting 3 stars because they did replace the messed up pizza."}
{"text":"Although the food is decent, this is the absolute slowest place I think I've ever eaten. My coworkers loves this place so we typically get there once or twice a month for lunch, and every time I can't believe how long it takes to get in an out. Food typically takes over 30 minutes, regardless of what you get. The specialty pizzas are great, but at about $25 for a large is very overpriced. Not worth going in unless you're looking for a long meal."}
{"text":"I really like this place alot. their pizza's are really different but really good! I wish i could say i had a favorite but ive liked every pizza ive gotten except the portabello mushrooms cause i dont like mushrooms but other than that they have an amazing beer selection! Major thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 0 star review.  I made it very clear in the beginning I can not have egg or dairy and am GF. Ordered hummus for the table which on the menu says comes with veggies. It did NOT come out with veggies, had to ask for them. Then when ordering my pizza, I asked to switch out veggies for others (as I can not have certain veggies) and server said yes. Place my order along with the rest of the table. My friends got their pizza, and the server came out and said they put all the veggies on the pizza and they were remaking it after food had been on the table for 5 minutes. Then when he brought out the pizza, it still had everything on it. No manger came out to apologize but I had to ask to speak to the manager. I was a server and it is not a hard job! There are 3 tables including ours in the restaurant. The server then choice to refill everyone's water but mine. So I had no dinner and no water. Wow..."}
{"text":"Came here before an ASU football game...it was not completely packed like the other places around, so we were seated right away, which was awesome. Great happy hour specials, including half off appetizers and very reasonably priced beer on tap. 

I loved the baked chicken wings with the sweet Thai chili sauce, and there are tons of beers to choose from! Mirror Pond Pale Ale is a fave of mine, so I was excited to see it on the list. 

A great option for game days!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a family restaurant. For most of my visit, there were at least 3 separate crying babies, so you'll want to choose somewhere else if you're looking for an intimate setting without the noise. If you don't mind it, this can be a cool place with neat decor around the restaurant. 

The food here was delicious, albeit a bit overpriced in my mind opposed to other pizza restaurants. Tried a Kosmic Karma pizza and a chicken calzone. Either one on their own is more than enough for one person and I ended up with leftovers of each. 

They could make some improvements with the quality of their furniture and items presented to you. The menus at the table were all falling apart from repetitive opening and could use a repair or update. The table was not balanced and rocked every time I touched it.  That coupled with the very dull knives to cut the pizza on plastic plates made for an annoying experience as I tried to saw each piece off. I think next time I'll stick with the online ordering and pick-up."}
{"text":"My husband and I came down from Virginia Beach for the GBvsCAR game. When the game was over we were starving! The first spot we wanted to go to was packed, but boy am I glad it was! 

I got the hummus for an app and veggie calzone for dinner. My husband had the traditional wings for an app and a medium two meat pizza. We were not disappointed! Being from NJ originally I've had the privilege to sample some really mouthwatering calzones from both Philly and NYC, this surpassed! It was flavorful and not too doughy so you could really taste the filling of the calzone. The hummus was also very well flavored with basil and olive oil served some soft pita chips. My husbands wings were mild (he's unable to do spicy foods) and only had a slight kick, but were tender and basically falling off the bone. As for his pizza, again not real doughy but the crust was cooked well and it was not soggy from the grease from the meats. 

There are three things that really impressed us while we were there: 1) Even packed full of out-of-towners and football fans, the staff was so nice and our server Dean was OUTSTANDING! 2) the meats, vegetables and cheese were fresh! 3) (this is amazing to only me) but there are so many vegan and vegetarian options! We can get & enjoy more then a salad!!! 

If you visit the area and enjoy good food this place is outstanding! A must try!"}
{"text":"Waited over 37 minutes for our pizza which was totally wrong. Then I asked what was the problem and they started to lie about the problem and did not even apologize!

This place is VERY EXPENSIVE and hit or miss"}
{"text":"This may sound dramatic but trust me i mean it.. i just had the best burger ive ever had at this Rocky River Mellow Mushroom, i know this place is known for its pizza but try a burger!!"}
{"text":"Cosmic karma with bacon... just get it!!! I work close to this location and my coworkers and I enjoy coming here after work. As long as the happy hour continues we will be there. Only feedback is make sure you staff only high energy servers. It's a fun place to eat and some servers just don't seem like they want to be working. It's not every sever but some of them, if they don't have an upbeat attitude they really shouldn't being serving! It's a busy place so the servers need to grab an energy and be ready to work hard!"}
{"text":"The Mellow Mushroom at Selwyn is the best pizza place in Charlotte! My husband and I love everything from the light baked pretzels as an appetizer, the ability to create our own mouthwatering \"Christmas\" pizza, always requesting  the best server Rio, and of course the unique school bus you can dine inside. The managers are always friendly and interacting with the customers, too.  No cons to this place at all - will keep eating here!"}
{"text":"Alright, Mellow Mushroom. Ya done did good.

Ordered two pizzas via Doordash tonight, and they were 'Mellow Mushroom Standard'. There's really nothing else that I can say about them, either way. If you know 'Mellow Mushroom Standard', then you know how amazing their pizzas are. If you don't know, then I'd recommend that you come find out. There really isn't another pizza like Mellow Mushroom's, and I could waste a bunch of words telling you why they're my favourite, but I'd rather just let their pizzas do the talking. These recents pizzas were perfectly balanced, and weren't greasy like the last ones. I'll continue to order from them, and if they ever 'slip up' again, I'll be sure to update my review. But for the moment, I'm perfectly happy with two perfect pizzas."}
{"text":"We stopped by  Mellow Mushroom about 1 PM on a Saturday.   About 2/3 of the tables were empty.  We were surprised to find there was a wait list even though there were only two on the list ahead of us.  Our wait was about ten minutes.  We almost left but asked first if we could just sit at the bar.  We were told that was fine but she was just getting ready to seat us.  Well, it took a bit for us to really get seated.  Thus, we were already getting ready to dislike the place.

Our waiter was friendly, efficient and fast.  We liked him so things started going uphill.  The menu was interesting but we knew we were there for pizza.

The pizza was great.  We enjoyed it and ended up taking part of it home.

Instead of a poor experience due to the front host, everything turned out nice.  We will probably be back."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza in Charlotte.  I mean that.  I really do.

I would like to think of myself as a bit of a pizza addict.  I hate that it is this way.  I think pizza is the only thing that stands in my way of looking as trim as Brad Pitt.  Okay I'm lying.  It's the Calzones too.

The thing that sets Mellow apart from others is the crust.  If you love a great steamy hot pizza with a nice crisp crust and not burnt at the edges, it's your kinda pie.  The edges are buttery and sprinkled with parmesean.  It's absolutely addictive.  

The staff is extremely friendly and you just have that feel of being in sort of a hippie joint where everyone is chill.  The porch is fantastic and we try to sit out there as often as possible.  

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is a fun environment, with good food and a good-sized menu. I've been here quite a few times, and although the service can sometimes falter, the food is pretty much always consistent. It's great for watching sports, although if you're trying to have a nice family meal, it can get pretty loud. 

They have lots of seating though, and usually something that everyone likes. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"It's all about the happy hour!   Great selection of beer and awesome folks offering suggestions behind the bar.   Everyone who I interacted with with awesome and friendly.  Three stars was given because their pizza is not great at all.  

For $23, there shouldn't have been as much crust as their was.   They definitely skimped on the sauce and toppings.  I understand food costs but, if another chain can offer a pizza for twice the size and twice the toppings for half the price, this place is either full of themselves thinking pizza is comparable, or doing something wrong.  

I do plan on going back for more drinks but, definitely not pizza.  I am willing to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"This is hands down my FAVORITE pizza stop in Cleveland. Based on other reviews, here are a few things to consider:
- It's very family friendly, so if that isn't your thing this isn't the place for you. Since I don't have kids I'm really not myself, but the place is too good for that to deter me.
- They make all of the pizzas made to order, and the crust is from scratch and hand tossed. This means you WILL wait at least a half hour or more, so order a side salad to enjoy while you wait.
- The price is more than say, Dominos... But based on the above comment, you get what you pay for. I would compare this similar to Dewey's and I think it's priced right.
- Great large bar. Every time I've been there on the weekend there has been a wait, so this is a good area to enjoy a beverage while you do.

Overall 5+! I crave their pizza (probably not a good thing haha) and love coming here."}
{"text":"Came here On Labor Day for lunch.  Clearly was busier then usual with people being out of work and school.  Cool vibe.  Like the decor a lot.  Staff was all very friendly.  Had a calzone. Delish!!! Paired well with my glass of white wine. Looking forward to trying the pizza."}
{"text":"I first tried this spot when I lived in Athens, Georgia, and was excited to see Cleveland open one as well. 

Atmosphere: its kind of like Dave's cosmic subs, older, more mature, but still a total deadhead, brother. The place is totally hippied out. I really like how open the floor plan is at this location. The one is Georgia was a lot more crammed together. 

Service: Service has been good every time I've been here. Staff is knowledgeable of the menu, and they pace out the table stops well.

Food: I can only review the gluten free pizza, but honestly, it's so good, that my gluten eating friends like it just as much as the regular crust. I like the classic cheese pizza, but I'll usually add a delicious pesto swirl on top. The pizza is excellent quality. The ingredients taste high end, and super fresh. 

Overall I am a big fan of mellow mushroom's pizza."}
{"text":"outstanding gluten free options. great services!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Every time I come here, the staff is always smiling, helpful and polite! Great place to grab cheap drinks and great food. I recomend any of their pizza's and their meatballs! Ohhh my goodness, their meatballs, so tasty! I wish they offered more than just 3 to a plate. Go sit inside the bar and ask for Lexi! She is so much fun, attentive, polite and great at what she does! Mellow you are lucky to have her! You guys are AWESOME, keep it up! :)"}
{"text":"I do not actually know why Mellow Mushroom left the Charlotte market a few years ago - but whatever the reason, they seem to be doing a bang-up job this time around.

This location on Selwyn was handing out slices - for free no less - but they still managed to have a crowd that was waiting to get in.  They must have been waiting for something other than cheese or pepperoni pie.

Like everyone else, we waited for our table, and were oh-so-glad when the food came out.  We chose the red potato pie (or something along those lines).  Think of a loaded baked potato spread out on a pizza crust and you will get the idea.  Talk about tasty!

Other than the wait and the prices that others have mentioned, the only real downside to the experience was the appetizer.  We tried some of their pretzels, and they seemed to be made of the same dough as the pizza crust.  Not surprising, but they just were not as good as a good sourdough pretzel with a hard crust on it.  You might want to skip these and save room for the pizza instead."}
{"text":"I usually like Mellow Mushroom pizzas so I don't have much complaints about their pizzas. Of course, it can't be compared to the privately owned pizza places, but considering it's a chain, their food is alright.
That being said, the atmosphere is what confuses me. if I had kids, I wouldn't bring them here. Psychedelic designs all over the place, magic mushrooms suspended everywhere and loud music playing... That doesn't sound exactly kid-friendly to me. But these guys surely must have their \"colorful\" atmosphere confused with a kids hang-out because they have these balloon boys twisting balloons for kids.
Also, halfway thru my beer I noticed a fruit fly floating about. I seriously don't know if it just got in there or if it was there all along, floating in my drink, but just covered up with the froth. Either way, I don't want to think of it. I told our server and she offered to get me another one, but by then I was done with my dinner so I just let it pass and they didn't charge us for the fruit fly beer.
Speaking of servers, it was particularly difficult to catch a hold of our original server, but I would overlook that because the place was really packed."}
{"text":"Okay first of the environment of this place is awesome. They have good music, cool decor and great people. They have one of the best pizzas around. The reverse happy hour from 10-2 weekly is the best thing since sliced bread!

I love the bar tenders. Every one of them is nice and funny! We love Aron, Nate and Keith. They always make you feel like family and the chill vibe is like nothing else on mill. Such a great place!!"}
{"text":"The hosts were nice. We were seated within 15 minutes in a Friday night at 645. The table we were given was next to the bathroom. We could hear the toilet flushing, so we asked for a different table. 
It took another 15 minutes for a table. 
Our server was super prompt and polite. She accommodated a few special diet requests (kids wanted broccoli on the side). Service was prompt. 
Food was on time. Appetizers were good. 
Pizza came. First, it was luke warm. Second, one of the pies was not what we ordered. Third, the gluten free pizza crust was really bad. The kind of bad that sucks. 
The manager fixed the pie mistake and got us a new one fast. 
The cheese was still hot and melted which made it the best pie of the trio, but the gluten free crust still really sucked. The kind of suck that fills you with regret for ordering it. 
I would eat here again because out server was really great. The hosts fixed the flushing toilet table problem, so that was good, and the manager was on point. 
The gluten free crust fills me with regret. 
If you are going to make food, make it not suck."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a better review but unfortunately I had a terrible experience. I only had 30 minutes to get food for myself and my wife prior to going to coach football practice and I had a groupon gift card. I found as Groupon for $20 with of food at mellow mushroom, so prior to buying it, I called them and ordered two hoagies, I told them I had a $20 groupon and asked if it would cover the hoagies and I was told it would. I bought the groupon and drove down there to pick up the hoagies on my way to pick my wife up from work before going to practice. I got to mellow mushroom and gave them my name, they pulled up my order and told me the total was $21.58. I explained that I only had the $20 groupon and that I had specifically asked if the groupon would cover the hoagies and was told that it would. My wife has both of my debit cards and I didn't have any cash on me. I explained all this to the manager and was told, \"it's only $1.58.\" as if belittling me for not having such a meager amount of money would somehow change my situation allowing me to pay the $1.58. so now i have a $20 groupon that I will likely not use and I left without any food. Thanks for nothing mellow mushroom.

Just an update. The owner reached out to me and we worked out the miscommunication. He was very professional and prompt in his follow up and I greatly appreciate it, so I wanted to update my review. Thanks Jay for taking the time to talk to me."}
{"text":"Well. This is it, Mellow Mushroom. I am breaking up with you. For whatever reason, we just can't seem to hit it off. We started eating in the Happy Valley location but after a long string of back luck we decided to try the take out route.

On one occasion eating in, our server went home after taking our order and never brought our food. On another, we waited over an hour after taking our order to get our pizza but when it arrived it was burnt to a crisp (and had the wrong toppings) on several occasions we were seated and it took 20 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. Call it bad luck or whatever but dining in has never really worked out for whatever reason.

Sigh, but now, \"take out\" isn't even \"working out\". We've had two incidents of driving to the restaurant at the time we were told to pick up our order and then we had to wait another 20 minutes because it wasn't ready. And on top of that our orders are consistently coming out wrong - and for the prices I'm paying, I deserve better. 

Originally, what I liked about Mellow Mushroom was that it was a little bit different than other pizza places. Unique pizza and sandwiches, sort of on the expensive side but a nice change of pace. Not outstanding but different. 

Generally, I have a problem with the service. I've probably visited this location about ten times (and as a former server myself) I have to admit, I've never been to a restaurant in recent memory where the staff is so unprepared or uninterested in what they're doing. From greeters who don't greet, to servers who disappear to food that arrives late (and often wrong) to getting the wrong check from a table of 8 (there were three of us at lunch) - we've just had so much bad luck with this place.

Working in a restaurant for years, I know that things happen and I'm willing to forgive and forget. And for Mellow Mushroom, that doesn't seem to matter much. On the last incident where we got the wrong order, no one even apologized. I can forgive mediocre food if the service is excellent but after so many chances, the only consistency I've found here is frustration. I tried. I really tried. But we have to break up. I need to find someone who appreciates me as a customer. 

If you are interested in the gluten-free pizza or if you enjoy a nice selection of beers, Mellow Mushroom is probably a good option. But at this price range, there are a lot of better options close-by that are less frustrating. I really don't like leaving negative reviews (the last restaurant I wrote one for is now out of business) but I hope Mellow Mushroom can improve and give others a better experience."}
{"text":"Best happy hour around! The craft beer selection cannot be beat.  We've become regulars because of the staff.  Love them! And if life couldn't get any better, they have a Groupon that includes happy hour AND alcohol!! (One per/table, of course). I feel like a thief. ...and will be be back to keep stealing. :)"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty black on the bottom.  Service was great, and the restaurant was very clean.  The MM in Columbia is much better!"}
{"text":"This pains me to write because I think their food is really good (hence the 2 stars). I placed an online order tonight and came with my two kids to pick it up right at the time it said it would be ready. I stood in front of the welcome booths/desk area they have where generally someone would be to greet people. No one was there so I waited...and waited. It took quite a few minutes (I was watching my phone) for someone to come up and ask me what I wanted. Keep in mind I have two small kids and I recently had a foot procedure done making it even worse.   (I even made eye contact with a few employees walking around who smiled and kept on walking.) I told the guy who came I was there to pick up an order and he said ok go wait at the bar and I'll bring your food out. I didn't exactly want my kids sitting at a bar lol but there we waited for another five minutes. By the time he brought me my food I just wanted to leave. 
Got home and see I ordered 2 ranch for the salad and got 1 blue cheese. The kids meal was also missing the apple slices, which really bummed my daughter out. Any parent with kids will understand driving 20 mins away and 20 mins back and your kid gets the wrong food. No fun. I feel badly because I paid for food that I didn't get. 
So even though I enjoy their food I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and had one of the best MM subs I have had...and I have had a lot! First MM with steamed broccoli instead of chips. Alicia was a great bartender! Parking outside is free after 6pm and we got a great spot.quiet nite though I bet not during games"}
{"text":"Loved their pizza.  Prices are not cheap.  But is it worth the price....uhm yes!  Go there today."}
{"text":"In the Anthem area, you are somewhat limited in your options when it comes to decent pizza. This is what led us to venture over to the Mellow Mushroom yesterday, as we decided that it was time to investigate this new spot. Around 6pm the place was pretty busy, but there were a few open tables still left and we were seated with the quickness at a booth near the bar. They have several nice, flat screen tv's and we got to catch part of the beating that the Sabres gave the Coyotes. As others have pointed out, it's not exactly quiet inside, but I didn't presume that I was going to be dining at a library so this didn't really bother me. The restaurant was clean and looked nice and new, so no complaints on the atmosphere from me. 
Now for the important part...the food. We ordered several items to share so that everyone could sample a few different things. As for the pizza, I thought it was decent, with a thicker dough-y crust and a nice, sweet sauce. I tried a bit of the Italian sandwich, and I was impressed with the real mozzarella, not bad, but I don't really dig onions and this sandwich had a lot of 'em. I also had about half of a meatball sub, and this was the highlight of my meal, it was just right and really hit the spot.
Service was excellent, and I can only assume that they'll continue to get better as the place was still fairly new. Nice work, Mellow Mushroom, we'll be back."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had in my life. I was looking forward to this, because I have been to other mellow mushrooms. However, this one was disgusting. For the price I paid, I would have expected a delicious pizza. The dough tasted like it was a wheat based dough. I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"So, I have mixed feelings about my experience at Mellow Mushroom. First off, there were plenty of tables open on a Thursday night which was great because we were seated right away. The bad news is that we didn't have the nicest server and the wait for the food was ridiculously long, about 45 minutes. However, the beer cheese was delicious to dip the parmesean pretzel bites in. (or so my husband told me) I ordered the gluten free crust which only comes in a 12 inch and is very thin. Unfortunately if you order a specialty pizza on gluten free crust, it sets you back about $20 per pizza. The redskin potato pizza was delightful and really different! The mellowterannean was amazing because it comes with Tzaki dipping sauce. Yes please! I would come back if they could speed up the service because I haven't had a better gluten free-vegan crust (they use Smart Flour!) I also like the location uptown next to the super cute park  and the funky ambience inside."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place where, after you return home from a trip, you always look through your pictures of it. 

Had the pleasure of coming here twice on my recent trip to AZ. The restaurant is in a great location, has great food, and awesome service. I wish I could remember the name of my server the first time, but the second time, we were served by Deonte (unsure of the spelling) and Destiny. We were from out of town, but this place was so hospitable and inviting. 

The pizza is fantastic. I tried their Caesar and Greek salad, both were okay. Nothing special, but still good salads. We also had the soft pretzel side, which was great. 

You genuinely enjoy yourself here. It has my definite recommendation."}
{"text":"Had a gluten free pizza. $20 for a personal pizza with burnt edges and no flavor? No thank you! 

Atmosphere has no personality. It's loud and far from my warm and inviting. 

If you want a chill place with good pizza, you're better off staying home and making a frozen pizza"}
{"text":"Tasty laid back especially during special times. The pizza toppings are fresh and strewn across a garlicy Parmesaned crust and the salads are huge and veggietastic. 

Happy hour M-F from 3-630. 
Weekly specials: M $3 Drafs, T $3.50 Local Drafts, W $3.50 Cab and Chard, R $3 Margs and LIT

The atmosphere is psychedelic and inviting. Big old porch to hang out on. Bathrooms are goofy. Great view of the dining room while you use the urinal."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I do a lot of catering orders for my biggest customer from this location. Jamie the general manager is outstanding! They have had staff come in early to get my orders done in time. And Jamie even went as far as to call in an employee who had the day off in order to deliver a order I had had forgotten about when I was out of town. That is the standard of customer service needed to have a competitive business in today's market place! And besides THE PIZZA IS AMAZING. Seriously. I have an edge over my competition because I am know as \"the company that brings Mellow\". Also a great place drop in for a beer and a healthy slice at lunch! Thanks Jamie and staff!"}
{"text":"Food, service, and a constantly changing beer list is awesome! The bartender Kara is always on top of everything! Best reverse happy hour you can find anywhere! ---at all the locations! Great place for food and drink at a more than reasonable price, late night, Come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner recently here on a quiet weeknight.  Service was very good.  The food was just so-so.  I had a house special calzone which included tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and mozzarella cheese.  The idea was appealing but the execution not so much.  I found it squishy-mushy with cheese oozing out and doughy inside.  Finally deconstructed and just ate some of the veggies from inside.  My companion fared better with a simple pepperoni pizza.  Small size was still plenty to take home.

I noticed several lunch specials which might be worth returning to try.  I don't think I'd come back for dinner.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I've had calzones in other places that were really, really good.   

One additional note, we sat at an ample sized booth.  When I sat down on the bench, I sank way low on it.  The worn out bench had several very low areas where it seemed I could be swallowed up.  So MM, I think it's time to change out some benches.  I felt like a 5 yr old barely looking up over the table."}
{"text":"I really love how relaxed the atmosphere is at this establishment. You can go with your family or just hang out with friends.

I am particularly fond of their Happy Hours! The regular and then reverse HH that is 10p-2a!!! Half off all alcoholic drinks and appetizers. What a treat!

Their pizzas can get a little greasy, but are otherwise delicious. I usually stick with their \"munchies\", can't go wrong with soft pretzels!

Every server I've had has been knowledgeable and friendly. One even remembered my custom drink name :) 

All in all a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at several different Mellow Mushroom locations. There is one just a few miles from my office. This one is just as good as all of the others. The pizza is very fresh with good ingredients. Because of their crust being a little \"breadier\" than some, I always get a loaded out pizza here. (Thin doughy crust is better for just cheese and pepperoni...breadier crust needs more ingredients.) Service was also friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The reviews are right: \"STINGY\" with the toppings. 

$18 custom salad that had high quality but very small quantities of each topping. $2.49 for half a small avocado. 

Jerk chicken hoagie $5.29 for a half was decent."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is definitely worth coming for. Cheap beers and cheap appetizers. Food here tastes great and when I went in with a large party the servers took great care of us."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good! We had the house special but added pineapple and took off the ground beef. A little ranch on the side and our meal was delicious. I normally only get thin crust pizzas because I don't like all that breading but their crust was really good. It has a buttery sweetness but with a wonderful crispy texture. Mmm! Next time I really want to try one of their salads too. For me, pizza and salad are the perfect couple. We'll definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza, but I had to detract two stars for price alone. 

The white gourmet gluten free pizza was quite good, I enjoyed the crust and the toppings as well. My husband enjoyed the large red potato pizza. However, due to the staggering price point, I do not see myself eating at this establishment often, if ever again."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and great variety of pizzas and beer. Little bit overpriced but still super good."}
{"text":"Found a Groupon ($20 for $10) and decided to eat here before a gaming night with friends.  My husband and I split the wings as an appetizer and split a medium pizza.  The wings are described as crispy baked wings on the menu, but they are just baked.  No crisp to them BUT they ARE quite tasty (we got BBQ).  For the pizza my husband got the house special on his half, and I got the \"philosopher's\" something on mine.  The pizza crust was amazingly buttery crispy and chewy.  The house special side was awesome.  I didn't care for the philosophers side.  I think it was more personal than any mistake of the kitchen.  My husband loved it all.  

Why five stars if the food wasn't perfect?  I don't blame the restaurant because I tried and didn't like something I have never tried before.  Also, the service was above and beyond, even though our server knew we had a Groupon from the moment we sat down.  I have been greeted with horrible attitudes and contempt in the past when it has been made known that I have a Groupon.   This guy wasn't phased at all,  he didn't treat us any differently from the large group next to us.  I'm terribly with names, but he was a bartender and we were in there on Monday 8/31 right after the storm.  We will be in there again this Monday, hopefully I will find a pizza combo I like this visit!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went during lunch, eager to try it out. We both left disappointed. All I wanted a slice of pizza, however, this pizza joint doesn't sell pizza by the slice! What's up with that? The waitress told us that they used to sell slices however they had a recent health violation with the way the slices were being stored so they no longer offer them. Well, I ended up ordering a calzone instead and my friend ordered a salad. 35 mins later our food comes out, which felt like an eternity for a hungry preggo. Overall the food was just, eh, okay. Probably won't be back as there are much better pizza options in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"Love coming to Mellow Mushroom! Always a good option when you are looking for pizza with a twist. The shitake mushroom pizza is great! As well as the jerk chicken hoagie. Prices are good and service is great as well. While the parking can be a challenge, there are meters right outside and the uptown location is always fun."}
{"text":"Huge selection of pizzas...or build your own! Can build your own salad too. Came here with a 4 year old, 3 toddlers, an infant,  and 6 adults. We surprisingly had a table that easily accommodated us.  Started with pretzels as an appetizer - garlic butter flavor."}
{"text":"My husband went there for date night. Atmosphere great!  

If you have a soy or nut allergy do not go here as they have nothing but salad for you to eat. 

Also will not be going back because my husband got food poisoning from the calzone."}
{"text":"I would give this place 2 stars, but it sucks so bad, I can't even think about it right now without getting sick. Let's start off with the wait staff. The waiter was horrible and had no personality. He simply nodded to imply \" what do you want to order?\" Aside from that the food was horrible. The most bland meatball sub I have ever had. It tasted like cardboard, and was cold and not fresh ingredients. I tried a friend's slice of pizza and it tasted like trash. Crappy ingredients and horrible taste. Never going back"}
{"text":"First of all, I'd like to attest that I've been a customer here for a while and one bad experience has completely changed my opinion about the type of service given here. Last night I invited 3 friends who had never been to this restaurant for happy hour. The bartender argued with me about the drink I ordered, which wasn't alcoholic to begin with. Took them over 15 minutes to take our order and there was no particular attention or checkup on how we were doing. The \"so called\" manager who I called and spoke to this morning happened to be the same guy who was chit-chatting with the bartender, instead of serving us or providing elite service. May this be a lesson learned to your company as I will take this matter to the corporate level. It's a shame to see the kind of management running this place when there's no certain reassurance on the type of expected service most loyal customers are accustomed to when they bring other clients into the scene."}
{"text":"Just an odd, odd vibe, all around.

First, prepare to waaaaaaaaaaaaaait. From the time we sat down to the time I received my drink was 16 minutes. Before I got that, though, was this weird exchange:

Me: \"I'll take a glass of the rose\"
Server: \"Can I see some ID?\" (I'm 33, so thanks!)
Server: \"And, we don't have a rose.\"
Me: \"Oh, you're out of it?\"
Server: \"No, like we don't have it at all.\"
Me, pointing to the menu: \"This says--\"
Server: \"Yeah, that's a corporate menu.\"

OK? And in the end...they DID end up have a rose, so that whole damn thing was for nothing. It was just a baffling way to start the night.

Food was super delicious (pretzel bites with beer cheese dip, one of their veggie pizzas), but the vibe here is just weird. There were completely hammered people at the bar (before the sun went down on a Thursday), and we witnessed one table next to us get a pizza delivered to them that they had asked for to-go, and another table stand up and leave after their server (same guy as ours) dropped off waters and basically never returned. My husband was like \"Jesus. Look at everyone working. No one seems to be alert at all.\" and it was true. Just shuffling around, not interested at all.

We paid and I watched our server chat and chat and chat and chat and chat with a table behind us while we waited and waited for him to drop my husband's credit card off. To be honest, we were trying to kill a ton of time this night because our power was out at home due to lightning, but if this were a regular night we might have followed suit on the table that walked out. Eating out is supposed to be relaxing, not super weird. Which sucks, because pizza is basically my favorite food group and like I said, the food here is really good. But no thanks."}
{"text":"Love me some Brian and Dana!   When they're not here Jenna & Jillian are excellent replacements.  Reverse happy hour rocks at this place!"}
{"text":"The reason i can't give it a full 5 stars is the service is spotty. Sometimes its really great with really friendly, awesome servers & other times, its like ... Geez, what bit her in the butt?

But the whole reason this place is so great is the Happy Hours are the best around. Half of appetizers & all the appetizers are incredible minus the wings.... (TRY THE ARTICHOKE DIP) yummmmmm.

& the beer is all super cheap on draft. Love the papago wheat beer. Delicious. 
Expect good food, good beer, & fun with your friends, but don't base your experience off the waiters because youll probably be let down."}
{"text":"Great beer.  Fresh beer on tap, which seems to be pretty rare for a lot of restaurants in Phoenix.    Pizza is good."}
{"text":"In the land of Charlotte pizza, Mellow Mushroom falls squarely in the good, A-OK category for me. I've been to many a Mellow Mushroom - Atlanta, Charleston, Raleigh etc. and while this location didn't disappoint me, it didn't thrill me either. 

The Good: 
1) The decor is hippie kitschy with a really cool school bus in the middle of the restaurant. I want to eat in a school bus. 
2) The bar is pretty spacious and they have trivia on Monday evenings.
3) Beer specials *can* be good, all depends on the night you go. 

The Fine:
1) I've had a variety of pies from Mellow Mushroom and I've enjoyed the White Pizza and the Veggie.
2) Our server was on point with multiple checks and beer orders. However, we did ask for a few things off our pizza that were left on, though. 

The Not So Great: 
1) The wait can be astronomical - and it's not *just* because it's a new location. Folks flock to Mellow Mushroom. In droves.
2) That being said, there can be tons of kiddos in the restaurant. Now, I don't have any problems with little ones - they have to eat too. The environment can be bit too conducive for the wee ones to run amock and into tables. Not so great. 
3) It's a bit pricey for what you get. Since I don't love love love the pizza, paying $20 for a 14\" pie leans on the higher pie price point.

Will I go back? Sure...if I can have a low key evening at the bar with minimal wait!"}
{"text":"Digiorno's saying is that it tastes like delivery.  This places motto should be it tastes like Digiorno.  They had plenty of fancy toppings but the thicker crust doughy pizza if I was blindfolded I would not tell difference between this and DIgiorno.

The place is nice and airy and has plenty of good beers on tap.  Kitchen is open late which is nice in uptown where many places close at 10Pm.    I do not know the Pizza places in Charlotte but surprised there are so many locations of this place when you could get the same by going to Harris Teeter getting yourself a frozen pizza and a 6 pack of good beer and eat at home."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about Mellow Mushroom and didn't even know there was one in Az! We drove by yesterday running some errands and decided to meet a few family members there for an early dinner. It was almost 5pm and I was surprised it wasn't already packed being a Saturday, we were sat quickly and our waiter was great. 

Still being slightly full from breakfast I decided to get an order of the bruschetta and half of the Jamaican jerk chicken hoagie (I thought half would be small LOL.) While we waited for the food I noticed how much I liked the music they played, very chill but upbeat house music that wasn't overly loud, obnoxious, or pretentious. 

Everything arrived and I was a little shocked at the size of my sandwich, 6 inches? HAH. Thank goodness for leftover boxes and hungry boyfriends sitting next to you. I tried a piece of the chicken by itself and was surprised at how perfectly cooked it was, not to mention super fresh tasting. I did noticed the pineapple pieces looked like the canned version and there were maybe less than 7 or 8 small little chunks. That is where my one star comes away from this place being a perfect 5. But the french bread was light and crispy and I really enjoyed it. 

The real star in my eyes was the bruschetta. In every way it was perfect, the thin crunchy bread that melted in my mouth, the fresh diced tomatoes, balsamic glaze that was addicting, crumbly feta cheese, and basil to bring it all together. I know if we come back here this will forever be on the table for me!

Prices weren't terrible, if you want to split a pizza or get a 6 inch sandwich that will be the most wallet friendly way to go. For four I think our total was $53 which isn't bad at all. 

I am hoping to try the other MM locations in the Valley soon, and I will be happy if they are all as good as this one."}
{"text":"Bad service. Waited for 20 mins. No one asked for drinks or anything.. lol probably not gonna come again.."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my recent rip to Mellow Mushroom.   My family of 4 went while on vacation recently and I'd wanted to try it.  The atmosphere is interesting-a mix of classic rock meets craft beer bar meets college town pizza joint.   

The pretzels to start were good-the beer cheese sauce was great.  Each of my 2 boys ordered a cheese pizza-one with garlic and olive oil sauce and one with traditional red and each liked theirs.  My wife and I split the Mellowterranean-it was good, but the chicken was out of place-could have been a straight veggie pie-but the tzatziki sauce was great for dipping.

Very doughy crust, but good sauce and fresh toppings make it a return spot next time we are near another Mellow Mushroom.  Plus, good tap choices and a different vibe than most places."}
{"text":"The only thing that makes me not a 5 star fan is the price. The quality is top notch and it's great but when you have to order 4 pizzas for a gathering it's like $100. Again, the buffalo chicken pizza is really awesome. The carmelized onions make the pie. It's about $25 for a large but worth it. Great the next day too so I look at it like it's multiple beers. I also had a beer at the bar while I waited to get it to go. Also a theme of my reviews lately. Great beer selection and fun to sit at the bar and watch college football. 

The swimmer eats a whole mighty meaty over two meals and love this for sure."}
{"text":"All of the smokey chipotle and poblano specials look amazing @mmMyersPark. I love the location. Easy parking behind and underneath. There is a huge school bus for seating in the center. I'm always amazed at how consistent the quality is at all the MM's. I love the Shrimp Salad special with juicy carmelized onions and roasted poblano peppers. Of course since I went salad I splurged on the hot pretzel appetizer."}
{"text":"Placed 8 people in a booth sitting elbow to elbow.  Server came to check on us twice in the hour and a half we were there.  Food was ok but nothing fantastic.  This was our second time here and my last.  Too crowded and not customer friendly at all."}
{"text":"For what could have been a great place, Mellow Mushroom does not deliver. On paper, this place sounds great--many different types of beer, unique pizza, good location, everything you need to be a thriving business on Mill. Even with all that, this place falls very short in my book.

More than once, my pizza has come out too gooey (I'm talking uncooked gooey). Service isn't anything special... some of the employees are actually a bit rude and arrogant and this really detracts from the experience. At first I thought it was just me, but I confirmed it by reading some of the other reviews here--they don't pour beer correctly and it takes away from the taste of the beer too early after pouring or you end up with 3/4 of what should be a full pint. This makes me not care how wide their selection is--you're ruining drinks and that totally sucks.

Also, the restaurant is too segmented. It almost feels like 4 dining rooms: one area straight ahead when you walk in, one area straight ahead when you walk in and to the right a bit, the patio area (including the section just left of when you first walk in), and then the bar area. This design doesn't work well on Mill Avenue and makes your place look empty even when there are several groups inside. On Mill, you want to seem like a popular spot but with everyone couped up in the bar area, the curb appeal of Mellow isn't very high.

Won't be back soon."}
{"text":"Rating based on service. 

Walked in at 1030pm, was promptly sat. Cool. 

Waited 10 minutes, watched several waiters look at us and serve other patrons. Left, and never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Found this place looking for pizza for someone with lots allergies. He was able to get gluten-free, dairy-free pizza - and loved it! Both pizzas were yummy. Wait staff was friendly and helpful, the greeter was not. The only thing that spoiled the mood was the music - loud crap dance stuff. Are they trying to be like a club? We did come right between lunch and dinner and were surprised that it wasn't busier (especially from the other reviews). We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend to friends.  Decor cool and staff friendly but this is the 2nd time I've eaten here and it takes over 45 minutes to get your pizza. The artichokes were canned and the cheese was low grade.  They brushed some oil on the crust and used canned Parmesan, really? Bottom line you pay premium price for low grade food."}
{"text":"Ok so here's the deal:  the so called food is bland, low quality, and over priced-  I'm not a cook, but I can cook better. The reason for the 2 stars is cause it's a restaurant.  

On the other hand:  large bar with awesome beer selection, great service, and interesting atmosphere.

I'd come back, if invited, 4 hh beer only.

Oh ya no wifi service"}
{"text":"We always get great service here and the beer selection and food is SO good! We didn't even mind sitting outside on the patio on a 100+ degree day. They have \"garage doors\" that open into the bar area from the patio and with air conditioning blowing out and the misters at our backs it was quite comfortable. The happy hour prices are a good value and they quite often offer Groupons which they accept with a smile that makes it an even better deal! I had the hummus appetizer which was pretty darn good and my husband had the meatball appetizer which he thought was very tasty. There is parking on High Street as well as parking behind the restaurant. Mmmmmm BEER!!!!"}
{"text":"Firstly, I am not a local.  I am in Tempe on business and have been horribly disappointed with the beer selections of most of the restaurants and bars in the area...until I found Mellow Mushroom.

I am a proud beer snob (cicerone cert) and I must say that whoever is doing their beer ordering is 100% on point.  I didn't try the food, so take this review as you will.  If you are looking for a place that serves world class beer you must come here.  I tried some of the local selections (four peaks) and wasn't impressed, but quickly found Ninkasi Vanilla Oatis which is a close to perfect vanilla bean stout.

Usually when a beer snob goes into a sub-par beer place they are met with either disdain or ignorance.  My bartender, Cody, was fantastic.  I was never dry, he was quick with samples and gave me a short rundown of the local breweries when I told him I wasn't from Arizona.

I took away 1 star just because the beer was waaaay too cold (I think they frost their glassware which is a big no no in craft beer).  My Ninkasi stout came out with no head and freezing cold (blasphemy for such a great stout)

I will definitely be back on my week long stay.  Cheers Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Well... if you ever were curious about this place. Don't bother. The initial wait was 10 minutes, no problem. Waitress came we ordered drinks, that took 10 minutes. Ordered our food that took 45 minutes. The food... bland. They gave me the wrong sauce, took our Waitress another 10 minutes to get me the right one. We sat looking at our empty glasses and remaining food for another 15 minutes before she brought over not 1 but 2 drinks we didn't want. We were done eating. We wanted boxes and the check. FINALLY she offered boxes... still no check. We pack up our boxes. Still no check. She comes over and asked about dessert. Then finally hands us our check. 

To sum it up... poor service, bland food, not worth the time."}
{"text":"They messed up my order and added cheese the first time. Regardless, it was amazing when my next one came out and they comped it of course. Love this place!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant, the service was fine. The pizza crust was good tasting, but thicker then we like. The sauce was good but there was too much cheese and not enough of the toppings. The alcoholic beverages are over priced for this area."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I like that they offer veggie and vegan options. The food is good but the place needs a deep cleaning. See attached photos of the dust build up on lights and decor hanging over entry Way and the tables where you eat food. Seriously hard to miss. A fly beat me to the menu; never a good sign. The server was nice and responsive but his shirt looked like he'd been wearing it all week; faded, stretched out, dirty. And though I enjoy hip hop, I don't prefer to listen to Eminem and NWA while at late lunch with my husband, & my father in law. The bathroom was not clean. One stall out of order. Another stall out of seat covers. Toilet paper on the floor. I did not see a manager type at all. And the place reflects this lack of managerial presence.  There are too many other places to get pizza in this town to eat with dust ropes over my food."}
{"text":"Best pizzas ! Wood fire! It tastes so great! Nice environment! Feel relaxed.
I hope they can open more business in other city! I tried so many pizzas, but nowhere can be better than here."}
{"text":"Our server, Steve was excellent. Very attentive and accommodating. There was 4 of us and 1 of the meals took longer because it was accidentally given to the other table, which they were apologetic about. I asked for my pizza well done and I got it and it was undercooked. They gladly put it back in the oven for me with apologies. 
Pizza was still not the best but the other 3 I were with enjoyed theirs. The manager gave us a discount on our check and also gave us an option of a free beer or dessert. It was very generous and unexpected of them."}
{"text":"The Maui Wowie pizza is no longer on the menu. A moment of silence, please. The good news is there's now one called the Pacific Rim (red sauce with mozzarella, ham, bacon, caramelized onions, pineapple and jalape√±os). It's kind of similar and also totally delicious. Okay Mellow Mushroom, I forgive you.

I'm not a huge crust person. For me, it's just a waste of carbs. However, I will eat this crust (buttered and sprinkled with parmesan) and I don't even need anything for dipping. They use the same dough for their pretzels. Mental note to myself: order the pretzels and beer cheese next time. For the gluten free crowd, there's a ton of options for you. We took advantage of the Yelp check in (free bruschetta or hummus) and opted for the hummus (easier to share since we had a group). I would normally never think to get hummus here, but it was tasty. Christi got the Enlightened Spinach Salad which looked good. I like that they also have a build your own salad section. 

This is a great spot to hit if you work uptown or at heading to either Panthers stadium or the ballpark. If you're not already uptown, it's kind of a pain in the ass to park. You have to pay at the decks. Pro tip: check the streets around it (Poplar, etc). Meters are free after 6pm."}
{"text":"Amazing selection of creative toppings for pizza.  Nice selection of beers.  Wine is not bad either.  They are open very late so it's a really nice option for late night munchies.   :)"}
{"text":"It's getting hard to please me when it comes to pizza.  After all, I am a 'pizza snob' by way of New York City and North Jersey, which is known to have some of the best 'mom and pop' owned, decades old pizzerias in our known universe.  We're talking classic, older, tweaked over time pizza recipes as well as baking methods passed down from generation to generation.  I tried MM with my daughter, and our taste buds left dancing!  The pizza here is truly excellent and near perfect!  Fantastic crispy yet airy crust, as well as flavorful aromatic pizza sauce and bubbly fresh tasting cheeses that flow and ooze when you pick up a slice.  Very well balanced throughout.  The dining area is large and roomy (with booths and tables), with an open kitchen and bar.  All in all, one of the better places for a good pizza in NE Ohio.  My only minor quibble is that the not so fresh tasting parm (blend?) cheese left on each table should be removed, and customers should be offered freshly grated cold parm or romano cheese brought in a small bowl or cup directly from a fridge, so they can sprinkle on their pizzas.  Also, you should have pepper grinders on each table.  Trust me, this makes a difference, and it appeals to the serious pizza conoisseur like yours truly (and quite possibly, you!).  Anywho, we will return as long as you keep making great 'pizza pies' like you do!  That's amore!"}
{"text":"Was just ok. I do expect more from this restaurant because we normally have good experiences. Ordered the pretzels with cheese dip. Pretzels were really under cooked. Both mine and my husbands pizza was under cooked on the dough. My salad ended up on my friends check but that got fixed. Charlotte step it up! Had great food and service in other states."}
{"text":"I've tried Mellow Mushroom twice - because I'd heard so many good things about the other location. Was sorely disappointed each time.

Salad portions were small, mostly lettuce with very few toppings.
Pizza was VERY bland and cold when served - both visits.

WAY too expensive for what you get... 
Fired Pie (SE Corner of Ray & 101) let's you build your own pizza or large salad with as many toppings as you want for a flat $7.75 price - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!

Won't be going back to MM!! For a nice sit down pizza place, Spinatto's is only a mile away - incredible salads, pizza & atmosphere - less expensive too!

Too many better options close by to waste my time or money here!"}
{"text":"If you like average pizza this is the spot. I LOVE pizza, and they're definitely not impressive, but they do make a good pizza. That being said it is a chain and they WAY over charge for a corporate pie with a nicely decorated building."}
{"text":"I have always loved Mellow Mushroom pizza, and their service was excellent for our large group. They had the food waiting for us when we arrived and the quality was on par for Mellow's high standards."}
{"text":"Best beer program in AZ. Jenna is a true professional who obviously cares and it shows every time I enjoy a -\"beer-perience \""}
{"text":"Just ok. Our order wasn't \"ready\" when we got there (our salad was still being made) yet when we got our pizzas they were cold. The pizza wasn't anything amazing but found a groupon for the restaurant so thought we would give it a try. Probably wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of mellow mushroom so I was very stoked to find out they had a location closer to my house at city north, and living in the valley for 15 years I had never actually been to city north so I figured two birds, one stone. First impressions: Beautiful. The inside is decorated...I don't want to use the word tactfully or elegantly, I think maybe the word is....busy? Lots of stuff and musical memorabilia around the place which is actually really cool looking, albeit slightly kitsch, but who cares, it is a pizza joint. The place was a ghost town though. And it's not like I went during off hours. Saturday during the day, during the elite eight. This place has a full bar and tv's all over the place and I can't have seen more than 7 people there. The food itself was delicious, got a Mediterranean pizza and a ceasar salad pizza. Although our waiter was very friendly and gave us semi-decent beer recommendations, for a place that had maybe 7 or 8 people dining, the wait time was ridiculous at times. Took way too long to get us our check and waters. This place could be cool, but the emptiness is just disconcerting and thus the ambiance is affected. Some of that may be out of their control, but regardless it was still kind of creepy. I will be back for sure, I love mellow mushroom and the close proximity is great, but I hope the restaurant steps up their game a bit with service and maybe reaches out to the community a little bit more to help fill the place. Maybe a promotion or two will get the doors open."}
{"text":"After taking a quick look around when I entered this establishment, I was fairly certain they garnished their pizzas with \"magic\" mushrooms. The decor was definitely awesome with so much to look at. Straight out of the Beatles \"Magical Mystery Tour\" album cover. Not very ironically enough, there was a pizza named magical mystery....which we ordered. I'm pretty sure there was a metal sculpture of Captain Jack Sparrow in an arch in the wall as well. Nothing quite says pizza like Bob Dylan album covers and pirates. 

My friend and I came here on a weeknight around 7 pm, so I didn't experience the long wait like some of the other Yelpers. Though I could tell that it had the potential for super crowds. It was indeed on the pricey side, however, the pizza itself was pretty damn delicious.

We ordered half The Magical Mystery and half  The Red Skin Potato Pie. I tried the MM first and thought it was too good to top...then I tried the potato pie...Potatoes on a pizza is the best carb/starch overload I have ever had the experience of consuming. It had some of the best combinations of flavors. I'm wiping the saliva off my keyboard even now as I write about it. 

I really feel like a pizza place can only be judged by its regular pizza. Pepperoni, cheese, sausage, etc. Seeing as this is a specialty pizza place, I think I am confident in the 4 star rating. As far as specialty pizzas go, this is one of the better places I've tried. It's different and fun. One day I'll come back for a plain cheese pizza and put it through some real tests..."}
{"text":"Update -7/23- we had two pizzas yesterday and were adventurous in trying the calzone but regret wasting our resources as the calzone was 80% dough and very little cheese. Not a true calzone!!!  1 Pizza was perfect yet our other veggie pizza was burnt and slightly sparse on the toppings.. meh!

We have driven by Mellow Mushroom 100x and never felt a thought to try... till now. We took out their Gluten Free Pesto Veggie, And a Marinara Meat \"Gluten Free\" Pizza.
1- the Flavors were Very Good!
2- for A gluten Free Pizza it wasn't bad, coming from NYC, there are better Gluten Free crusts, this is about middle of the road but way better than stuff I had 17 years ago Gluten free lol
3- Meat pie was VERY good, and plenty of toppings but the Pie size aren't very large for the price paid!
4- Pizza was hot, sauce was good, and well balanced.

Unfortunately, It always seems more expensive to eat healthier or different than normal, and there doesn't seem to be an economy of scale to bring costs down yet. We will definitely go back, and hope there are better values than $40 for two medium pies!!"}
{"text":"Our server susan was the best! Very sweet and knowlageable about the menu, helpful as all heck! The food was also great, the veggies were all very fresh! Will totally be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent movie themed decor, cool bartender PJ, the servers bring your food and know you by name, attractive staff, good parking,  good location.  5 star worthy in my book!  Had the twice baked hot wings, a lunch special pizza with pepperoni,  bacon, n ham, AND a half chicken cheese hoagie w chips.  Excellent prices, very worth it.  I wish I could say more about this place,  but it was my first time.  A mellow virgin.  Def will return, soon."}
{"text":"I wish we had a Mellow Mushroom in California and would seriously consider it- Spoke with the manager at this location and he said that California does not allow one of the ingredients they use in the dough.  THAT'S WHY California pizza sucks!  The dough!  I need to find out what this ingredient is, smuggle it into my state, and TAKE OVER the pizza industry here in California!!!  Great service!  great beers!  Great selection of pizza and other foods- Everything is perfect- When you see a Mellow Mushroom you have to go in.  And enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch at this restaurant! The food was great and so was the service! I would recommend it to all! Yummy!"}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday after the movies and it was awesome. Jessica our waitress was amazing suggested the holy shitake pizza for me and it was yummy!! My husband had the house special and he was very happy too. We had eaten here when it first opened and got very bad service and food... but not any more, glad we gave them a second chance. Excellent service and plenty of leftovers for today....delish!"}
{"text":"My wife were here with a large group, so I was expecting a long wait.  But we waited a long time to be seated.  It was cold so I wanted a hot beverage.  Hot buttered rum? Nope.  Not a surprise although it would have been nice, but they didn't have coffee, either.  

It took forever to get our orders, which came out all at different times.  My wife and I shared Philosophers Pie, a Greek style pizza with Portobello, feta, olive, and beef.  It was very good, though I'm pretty sure the price on the bill was higher than the menu but by that point I had been there long enough and just wanted out of there.

Others in my party were dissatisfied with their food.  Indeed one woman ordered a burger and it looked tough and overcooked.

It was a good artisan pizza but there are far better places to go than this."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, and they have a few gluten free options. Unfortunately the gluten free pizzas are pretty small, but still good. We went in on a slower weekday night and it didn't take too terribly long to get our food. I wouldn't say I HAVE to go back, but if I was in the area again and craving pizza I'd go back."}
{"text":"Spent 45 waiting for a club sandwich and they only brought out 1 half. This was total epic fail"}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza!  I had the Kosmic Karma and the Buffalo Chicken, both were delicious, but I preferred the Kosmic.  Happy hour was 3-6 (only mon-fri I believe) with half price drinks and appetizers.  I got a margarita for $3.50 on HH and it was pretty good.  Service was okay."}
{"text":"It's got great pizza but is more than a pizza place. The salads are tasty and interesting, more than the typical romaine/iceberg with the usual dressings. The portobello mushroom appetizer is not listed as a salad but comes on a bed of arugula with a delicious creamy garlic sauce drizzled over it and is fantastic. I had my first beer cheese here and it was delish. It's a fondue like mixture of beer and cheese just in case you weren't sure. It went extremely well with the pretzels they serve it with which are made from their one of a kind pizza dough. Their dough is so soft and uniquely them, it just can't really be compared to other pizza dough. I think they use whole grain flour, yet it isn't cardboard like. The mushroom pizza is really really good and again has said creamy sauce drizzled all over. They offer a wide selection of beer on tap including several hefeweizens and a raspberry wheat which I loved. On certain nights they have entertainment, I've seen a DJ and some trivia games being played that anyone could participate in if they were staying for a while. Each time the service was speedy, friendly and humorous. Definitely at the top of my list for pizza night out."}
{"text":"I almost feel like Mellow Mushroom tries just a little too hard to be trendy and keep the \"stoner food\" theme going while making it family-friendly at the same time. I will admit, though, the hippie school bus and the mushrooms on springs are a fun novelty that keep me entertained.

But kitschy-ness aside, the food is pretty darn good. The pizza crusts are chewy without being rubbery, not too thick and not too thin. The topping combinations are certainly interesting - not anything I would have thought to put together on a pizza.  But they work.  I tend to go for the Philosopher's Pie, which features steak, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, olives, mozzarella and feta on an olive oil and garlic sauce. I recently tried one of their sandwiches, too, which make for great lunch fare. Added bonus: Mellow Mushroom can easily appease the vegetarian/vegan diners as well as providing gluten free options (expect a wait for gluten free, though: they take it pretty seriously and clean the kitchen before making gluten free dough to ensure it's safe and truly gluten free).

And the beer list is well developed for a chain, too. Yeah, Bud-Miller-Coors products are there for the unadventurous, but the craft selection is enough to keep most beer fans happy. You get the usual suspects (Bell's, Dogfish Head, Smuttynose, etc) as well as a great selection of local brews too. If it's in, be sure to grab a glass of Catawba Valley Brewing's White Zombie.

Be warned: they are a bit pricey. All said, it's a fun place to gather with friends for pizza and beer."}
{"text":"awesome beer and amazing pizza. Get the buffalo chicken pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Much better than the Selwyn location! Decoration is sweet and if you get a chance to sit at the touch table, your little ones will be occupied for the whole dinner. (Almost like a date night.)

Getting a table on a busy night can be a bit unorganized with the crowd and the faux hostess stand in the middle of the crowd. But once you're seated, it is worth the wait. 

Pizza is phenomenal. The crust makes the pie. Umami, house special and mighty meaty are choices that you can't go wrong with. 

The bonus is a nice beer selection. Nice local craft selection and some rare finds from time to time. 

Mellow Mushroom is a family favorite."}
{"text":"We like going here for the friendly service and great pizza!  There are soo many beer choices!   The pizza is super filling on thick dough."}
{"text":"Meh. Who cares if the product is good when the service is lackadaisical and thoughtless. Bad experience tonight, should've gotten a lot more eager attention being one of the only parties in the place. Sorry to disturb your \"mellow\" employees with our patronage. If you're looking to be greeted and treated right I'd suggest Nello's right down the street."}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood happy hour spot... Fantastic selection of craft beer that MM is known for, and also a great selection of apps are 50% off during 3-6pm.  Their wings are unique, sweet Thai chili and naked are my personal favorites.  Service can be hit or miss, but I've never had a bad experience here, nor at their High Street location, which would be a better choice if you're looking for a quiet evening.   The Norterra spot is far busier from my personal experience, more lively, and it being so close to my house, dangerously convenient (love me a pint of PranQster).   When they role out their annual Groupon 50% off deal, we snatch them up immediately because unlike some establishments, MM lets you use your Groupon during happy hour.  Win-win in my book."}
{"text":"Love the pizza. Crust is nice and chewy, topping are fresh. The issue with this location is parking. It can be tough to find a spot on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"Ok so we did NOT stay during our most recent visit. 

We had a Groupon so my husband and I decided to head here for a date night and it had been quite a while since we've eaten here. 

We sat down and ordered a couple of beers. (The beers were the only reason this review is 2 stars) While enjoying our beers we started noticing how overall dirty the restaurant and servers appeared. 

This place needs a deep clean, a fresh coat of paint and the staff could use a refresher course in grooming and their appearance. 

We ended up cancelling our order because of the unappetizing feel of the place. We paid for our beers and went somewhere else. 

Hopefully management can take notice and turn things around for this place. We used to like this place a lot."}
{"text":"So we went in today around 1:30/2ish for lunch for our first time here. We were excited but that soon ended after we realized the kind of service we were receiving. Both my significant other and I work in restaurant management in the area so we understand how restaurants work but also the difference between great service and poor service. First, our server never mentioned her name, so when we needed her multiple times, we had to call out to get her attention. Second, we told her it was our first time here and she told us nothing about the menu or drinks, she suggested water...... Yes i said water, isnt it free? Isnt a server's job is to upsell the menu? Not here i guess. Third, when we were ready to order, she was on her phone at the bar and we're looking at her waiting waiting waiting. Her phone was way more important then making money. Fourth, food comes and we're excited, looks great, we're starving! We got a half mighty meaty and half maui wowie pizza, the mighty meaty was amazing but we hated the maui wowie, the pesto was just not what we were expecting, and thats okay because we understand that personal preferences are not the kitchen's fault, but if im paying $30 for a pizza and want leftovers for dinner, i want to love what im having and not be feeling bad for telling the truth about it when asked. We tell our server we dont like the maui wowie and if we could switch it out for the mighty meaty completely, she asked us what was wrong with it and we told her we just didnt like the taste and she brought the manager over. Now for me i hate complaining to servers because i get what restaurant business is like and how servers can take complaints, im more inclined and open with a manager because its their job to care and make the experience better and take feedback constructively and go above and beyond for the guest..... Well i was wrong once again... The manager seemed annoyed that we didnt like our pizza and when we told her what we wanted, she had a dirty noncompassionate look on her face.... Well that did it for me, i was done with this place and wont be returning back simply because of service and management. Service is the invisible product and the reason why people return back no matter if you mess up because we understand mistakes happen, but the way they made us feel was we werent cared for and as if we were an inconvenience. When i walked into the bathroom i counted the amount of guests in the dining room.... 33 guests.... About 35-40% occupied restaurant. Server's name was Melissa, which we found out when we got the check, which we waited at least a good 15 minutes for. And when boxes got dropped off, they got slipped onto the end of the table and she just walked away with a careless look. Smh, beautiful, clean restaurant with terrible service. Should of just went to Bomba like originally planned but wanted to try something new."}
{"text":"Okay, so this place gets three stars for the food but one star for service and convenience. Granted, I've only done take-out here, but both times it was a bad service experience. First time, they tell my food will be ready in 30 minutes. I'm there 30 minutes later and it's still not ready. I sit inside for like five minutes then tell them I'm going to sit outside with my kids (there's a little bench outside), so please knock on the window or call outside to let me know it's done. 15 minutes later, I'm still waiting, kids are going crazy. I go inside and not only is my food done, but it's been placed in the warming holder waiting for me. By the time we got home, pizza was mushy and not great. Maybe it would have been better had they let me know when it was done. Thanks.

Second time (there only was a second time due to a Groupon and the fact that my husband likes their house special gluten-free pizza), both take-out spots were filled and no parking on the street anywhere. I ended up having to park in the freaking garage and haul my kids and my pregnant self all the way down and across the street in 105 degree weather to get our mediocre take-out. I get in there and SURPRISE I'm the only one getting take out. I mention to them that I just had to walk from the garage because both their take out spots are taken and there's CLEARLY no one in there getting take-out but me. They give me a little sad look and say, \"We know.\" I got a hoagie this time and my husband got the house special gluten-free again. My hoagie was fairly good, but nothing really special. I won't dare get take-out again from Mellow Mushroom for fear of the hassle I'll have to go through next time. Also for fear of looking like Rocky when I wake up like I do this morning from the crazy amount of salt in my food. No, thanks."}
{"text":"We have dined here dozens of times since it opened.  The food is average, the beer selection is pretty decent and the service at the bar is fine.  However, the overall quality of the experience is seriously lacking.  For the first time, last evening, my family and I chose to dine in the restaurant (not the bar).  We waited 5-6 minutes at the hostess station until an underwhelming goth-like teen, lacking facial expression, appeared.  She was so unobservant -- she brought our 7 year old a regular menu and then, after realizing the 3 foot tall skinny blonde was a child, asked her if she would like a kids menu.  

We then sat at the table for 10 minutes without so much as a glance in our direction from any wait staff.  The young teen hostess cleared the table next to ours, and seemed unaware that we remained seated without service.  There were tables being served all around us -- yet, we sat there.  A young man, covered (from neck to arm-sleeve) in tattoos walked by us after about 12 mins and let us know he would be right with us.  But then failed to acknowledge us again -- although, he walked past the table a dozen times in the following 10 minutes.  No one seemed to notice when we got up and simply left 22 mins after we arrived, nary a water on the table."}
{"text":"When I see a China Mist Iced Tea container I usually feel I'm in good hands.  I don't know if they just use the container and are using a cheaper brand of tea or it's just not strong enough but the Iced Tea was MEH.  I am picky about my tea!

 Pizza is near and dear to my heart and when I found out I had celiac disease and could no longer eat main stream pizza it just about killed me!  I have embraced the gluten free lifestyle during the past year and have been on a journey for excellent gf pizza.  I found it at Picazzo's and pay a very good price for it.  When I saw the $18.50 price tag for the \"House Special\" gf pizza at Mellow Mushroom I thought:  Cool.  Pricey but should be an excellent za.

Here is the explanation of ingredients:  Red sauce base, Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Sausage, Ground Beef, Onions, Green Peppers, Mushrooms, Black Olives, Tomatoes, Ham, Bacon, and extra cheese.  Wow!  Sounds great right?  

Okay, first off I am not a ground beef on za kind of girl.  So I asked not to have any. All the GF pizza is on a 12\" crust.  Pretty standard.  I asked and the server said that corporate makes their flour and sends it to them to make in house.  Okay.

The crust includes bean, rice and tapioca flours as well as many other things.  I have had gf pizza's many places and I have to say that this crust was the worst I've ever had.  Including those made with mixes from the store.  It was nasty.  Soggy cardboard about sums it up.  I finally gave up and just scraped the toppings off to eat those it was so nasty.

The toppings themselves were okay.  The meats were forgettable but the veggies were pretty good.  I think I've decided I prefer yellow and red peppers over green and I really prefer those and my onions caramelized vs. fresh. The other thing is that their tomato sauce was extremely bland.  Tasted like mediocre tomatoes which were just pureed with no spices whatsoever. Come on, it's almost a $20 little pie.  It needs to taste like it.

My husband had the regular House Specialty pizza and he was equally unimpressed. I won't be back!  I know where I can get my $20 excellent pie and this IS NOT it!"}
{"text":"Yukon gold is amazing, it is like a baked potato, just on a pizza!  I hate that they got rid of their Wyders Pear Cider, it complemented almost all the pies i tried... Guess i will have to settle for beer next time"}
{"text":"It was Saturday night. We had a medium pizza, half of Melchacho, half of Fun Guy, and a beef calzone. Waitress came to us and informed that the cook had mistakenly make a chicken calzone instead of beef one. She asked if it was okay. We asked for the beef. Because of this mistake and not being asked if we want the food served together, we had our pizza served before the calzone, so the person who supposed to have a calzone had to wait while I was eating. It was quite inconvenient.

The pizza was tasteless. The dough was worse than in Ahwatukee location. Fun Guy part was lacking the mushroom quantity, having big plain cheese areas. Overall, it was the worst pizza I have ever had in Mellow Mushroom.    

Waitress didn't try make even one smile toward us, that how great the service was. Awful experience, considering the gift card that covered the most of the bill. It is nice that the owner gives you a gift card as a formal apology, but it isn't worth going back when the pizza is not so good and the service is so terrible.

I got the feel that Mellow Mushroom came to conclusion that selling beer is more profitable than making tasty pizzas."}
{"text":"Love this place! Pizza is delish! Atmosphere is nice! We make special trips because there is not one close to us, worth the drive!"}
{"text":"If there were a 'zero' star option in Yelp, that's what I would rate this pizza dive.  Extremely slow, overwhelmingly overpriced and horrible is an understatement for the food quality.  I wouldn't come here again if it was the last meal in Phoenix.  So, if you're ready to partake in a night full of dismay, dissatisfaction and under indulging food, make your reservations now.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom keeps the consumption of pizza interesting in a casual, laid-back atmosphere.  Pizza joints are a dime a dozen in the United States, and I experience a serious amount of pizza consumption fatigue as mushroom pizza has become a food group in my family.  Enter Mellow Mushroom, stage left.  We've been enjoying Mellow Mushroom since our days in Georgia and were delighted to find a location opening up in the trendy Mill district of Tempe.  (Well, trendy for Tempe.)  I usually find a few pizzas that I'm interested in trying when reviewing the menu.  Having good bear helps as well."}
{"text":"Wait..Why does the pizza dough taste like wheat bread? The pizzas looked so good when they were being brought out, but the dough was kinda dense...The wings were 5 stars, very good! Very very expensive!! Probably wont be back.."}
{"text":"We had a lovely dining experience. We got a half order of wings, and a large pizza with half mighty meaty and half philosophers pie. Our server was friendly and attentive. The wait was a bit longer than we would have hoped but not bad considering how full the restaurant was. It was insanely loud inside so we sat on the patio. The tables were a generous size, but there was no outside light source and plenty of smokers outside the gate violating the proximity requirements making the while thing rather dark and smokey. Very much made up for by superb food and service."}
{"text":"I drove by this place the other day on the way back to my friends house and decided that I had to try this place out.  I've heard of it before, but never eaten here, so I thought I would give it a try.  

My friends and I came in on Saturday night and grabbed dinner.  There were four of us total and we were seated right away.  The place is decorated like a movie theatre, which I really liked. Place is spacious with plenty of seating. Two of my friends split a pizza with drinks, while I went with half a steak and cheese sandwich with chips.  Other friend went with a calzone and drinks as well.

The food came out and we all seemed to like it. Service was awesome, and the waitress was really attentive, which we liked.  Our drinks were always full, food was served promptly, and the menu had a great selection of items to choose from.  I got enough chips, but I felt like I got the bottom of the bag as most were smashed under the big ones.

I ended up not getting a drink myself, but they have a great beer selection from what I noticed.  I found the drink prices to be a bit high, but not outrageous.  $7 for a beer and about $10 for mixed drinks.  I don't know if they have happy hour or not, but I would probably go if they did.  I tried one of my friends beers, and it was tasty.

Overall, we had a really good time here. I don't think it's the best food I've ever had, but I enjoyed my time and would return in the future for more."}
{"text":"Artichoke dip was good.  Otherwise I dont think ill be going back.  $7 for a lil ceasar which is just some iceberg lettuces a tiny bit of cheese and 3 croutons.  That along with the wait- not worth it for me.
Thanks for the group on cause for 2 apps and two small salads it would have been $60 otherwise."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza, a little pricey. The dough is a little thick and chewy, but it's good overall. The pear cider is awesome though."}
{"text":"Not gross but also not good.

We came in here on a Sunday and got a jalape√±o & pineapple pizza and a \"giant\" chocolate chip cookie. The pizza was just okay. They put a lot of Parmesan cheese on it before asking if we like that; we don't. The cookie was not giant either... It was also quite cold and mediocre. The bartender was nice but I felt bad for him bc there was no waiter in the bar section so he was unfairly busy. Oh and why are they playing Micheal Jackson instead of the football game audio? The world may never know."}
{"text":"Coming from NYC, I've been pizza spoiled but Mellow Mushroom isn't half bad. They're pizza is slightly overpriced in my opinion but taste wise, they could do worse. On top of that their happy hour is bomb. 50% off most drinks? Yes please. Their desert options were a little lackluster but tasted great nonetheless. (Go with the brownie) Our server Cam, was excellent. Great sense of humor, quick service, and he made some solid recommendations. He's one of the reasons we'll return to this specific shop. Well, him and the happy hour..."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to mellow mushroom! The food is good but it's confusing that they have no idea about their yelp complimentary item when checking in. I asked for a salad and the manager told the server that giving items away are not acceptable. The environment is very brute and vibrant, staff is very friendly! Great beer list and many options outside of pizza. Highly recommend enjoying the outside seating while the weather is still nice! If you're close to rocky river walk on over and enjoy some drinks!"}
{"text":"I usually don't like to give bad reviews, but on a few separate occasions we've been here and had some issues. On a weekday I've experienced a 45min-hour wait for food (ended up being late to our movie our last visit) and on weekends upwards of an hour (which is a bit more understandable given the crowd). I've also noticed that more than once a few people from my group ended up sick after eating there (myself included). Servers definitely try their best from my experience, so it may just be short staffing or poor management in terms of the wait, but overall I'd pass on this place :/"}
{"text":"Pizza down! How embarrassing! OMG. The table size in bar area is 24\" for a 16\" large pizza. Doesn't make sense. Very uncomfortable. Servers amazing. No problem getting new pizza. Love the monthly beer special too! My 12 ye old boy is hungry!
Please get new tables and we will be back. Pizza delicious"}
{"text":"I will admit right off the bat mellow has some good deals and great beer selection which is why I have given them any stars. their late night happy hour is the best deal on mill ave on a week day night right up there with cue clubs drink prices. 
however that is where the good things stop for this location, this is some of the worst service I have ever received. I have been here on 2 different occasions and both times left a bad taste in my mouth here is just a short list of things that were not satisfying about it ,

going up to the bar and waiting for service for 5 min when the bar only had 3 other people at it. then waiting another 5 min for my beer
having then try and charge me for beers i did not order or drink
having them bring more then one person in party (3 to be exact) the wrong beers 
food taking upwards of 25 min for apps
bartenders giving 0 attention even when I am asking about specific beers on tap they do not know descriptions to give me 

no one in the place made me feel welcome , made me feel they knew anything about their own jobs or products, or even cared to try. its unfortunate  cus it is such a great location and I have been to other locations and never had any of these issues. even the manager who came to speak with us about our beers being incorrect and our tab being wrong was rude and seemed like he didnt care , will not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Very good pizza located in the heart of downtown Temp by ASU.  Always had delicious pizza and great service.  There selection of unique pizzas is what makes this place different.  Only issue is that the price is a little bit higher than your average pizza place.  Aside from the price this place is tasty & recommended."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to this location.  The service was much better this time around and everything came out promptly.  We ordered the Holy Shiitake (which was ahhhmazing) and pretzel bites.  The bites were slightly undercooked and doughy.   Nonetheless it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Everyone has covered this place to perfection in their reviews.  
My opinion:  it's OK.  The negatives outweigh the positives, though.

The food:  Good.  I had a pizza (Philosopher's).  It was good.  Solid.

Service:  Average at best.  

Wait time:  There's a sign that asks for your patience, as they bake everything fresh.  That's fine and all, but 30 freakin' minutes for a 10\" pizza?!  C'mon...

Prices:  Everything is $2.00 - $3.00 higher than it should be.  Not worth the $$$.

I likely won't go back.  The hippie decor is cheesy, the place is extremely loud, and I can get better pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"Took my mom to MM for the first time on her birthday. It was 10/5/14 (a sunday after the panthers game). They were busy and we were okay with waiting. However, we waited an hour and fifteen minutes for two pizzas that we ordered. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we only got ONE of our pizzas. After our waiter (who never gave his name) came back and told us that the cooks wouldn't tell him where our pizza was, I asked him to get a manager. The manager came back and said that our pizza had been dropped on the floor and the cooks didn't want to tell anyone and get in trouble so that it would be out in 6-8 minutes. meanwhile, our waiter was going to bring my mom a birthday dessert. After waiting for the second pizza for an additional 20 minutes and half of our party was done eating, I began to start on my pizza. Half way through, I found a disgusting hair in my food. Asked my waiter to speak to the manager AGAIN. It took the manager (who never gave his name either) 10 minutes to come to my table and explain this situation to me. Needless to say, we didn't finish, pay for, or take the meal home. This place is disgusting, the waiters and managers are extremely unprofessional and if you want good service and pizza, visit the Myers Park location. THIS IS NOT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO."}
{"text":"Overall - mediocre at best.  This time we had baked wings, meatballs and pretzels.  The food is ok - service is spotty, slow even. (I waited for quite a while to be acknowleged then nearly twice as long to be acknowledged again to place my order - I had to re-order the pretzels; just a little disconnect there)   The beer selection is pretty good but these days, that's almost a standard.   I am certainly confused about the theatre atmosphere..."}
{"text":"This place is OK.  The food is good and the beer selection is great however the service is consistently lack-luster."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience in last 5 years!! Sat down w/ 2 kids during lunchtime on a Tuesday.. put kids orders in rt away but noticed server was working several tables both inside and outside.. had to ask several times to place drink order and ordered a beer that came 25 minutes after it was ordered (kept time on phone)... Completely aggravated w/ service so told server to pack everything to go, salads and all as kids had still not gotten food. Waited an additional 20 minutes for pizza up front and finally asked to speak with manager. Manager told me he was in kitchen helping as they were \"overwhelmed\" w/ above normal lunch crown for a Tuesday.. first question I asked him was how long does it normally take to get pizza on table when ordered.. said 20 minutes! I waited 53 minutes for single pizza and manager stood there w/ dumb look on his face b/c he knew I was right. Told him I was not looking for anything free or taken off bill as bill was already paid and I tipped server 20% as this was not his fault.. business completely understaffed for a lunchtime crowd! Avoid this place at all cost and look at the other reviews.. seems to be common consensus that service is bad, place is dirty and overall just another overrated restaurant along Mill avenue run and serviced by \"at their own pace\" hipsters"}
{"text":"The service in the atmosphere are very appealing. Prices are a little high but quality is good. Sometimes don't think that attention is given to details as well as it should be. But for the most part would recommend it highly for good quality pizza and food."}
{"text":"You know Happy Valley is a boring road when a Mellow Mushroom is the most happening spot for food AND drink. Good thing they take advantage of it!

So there's a bigger bar here than I've seen at other locations, and a respectable patio to match. Even if you don't come here for the delicious varieties of pizza, it's almost got a dive bar atmosphere...with a couple dozen rotating tap selections with some really awesome beers like Magic Hat. Also, they've got some insane deals on cocktails...like the \"Irish Trashcan\" which is pretty much an AMF with a little can of red bull opened up and dunked in your glass. 

People are seriously getting their drink on here like it's the Mill Ave location. I love it!"}
{"text":"I dont see how this place ever got a bad review. Pizza was great a little pricey but great.  We did a half and half pizza , veggie and the other half was the meat piiza. Great crust sauce , the ingredients seemed very fresh.  Beer was great of course.
We also had apps, had the pretzels with beer cheese and the humus. Both very good. Great place."}
{"text":"if you can ignore the moody servers, you'll enjoy the pizza here."}
{"text":"The specialty pizzas at this place are phenomenal and come in thin-crust or original-crust styles. The tables and decor are interesting, and it's fun to share and trade slices with friends. Our 10-person party got a Hawaiian-style pizza; a Thai-style pizza; a potato-style pizza; a spicy pizza with jalapenos, spinach, mushrooms, and feta cheese; spinach-and-artichoke dip with bread chips; and wings.

My only gripes are that we had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to be seated due to another, larger party ahead of us; we had to wait quite a while between when we had ordered and when we had actually received our food; and not all of the menu options show up online.

That said, the pizza was well worth the wait, and we can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"What can you say about mellow mushroom that hasn't been said 1000 times already. Their pizzas are not your standard pizzas. The secret is in the crust which has an awesome garlic flavor and are extremely tender. And a beer selection is vast. Great outdoor seating"}
{"text":"I came here with my partner-in-crime Brian V. because I heard they had really good gluten free pizza...I was not disappointed. We ordered the gluten free House Special - Red sauce base with mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, ham, Applewood smoked bacon, mushrooms, black olives, Roma tomatoes, green and peppers...without onions. Our pizza was delicious! The service was great!  I will definitely return for more yummy pizza next time I am in Tempe!"}
{"text":"So, my wife and I didn't intend to eat here. The other two places we walked into had an hour wait. So we came here, cause I felt the building looked pretty cool. 20 minute wait for a table, which was ok, but we also had option to sit at bar. I'm not a bar type person, but my wife wanted to so we sat. That is our lead up.

The food was terrific. The bartenders were terrific. We are not alcohol drinkers, soda is our choice. All three tenders kept us refilled. They were all so pleasant. I checked in on Yelp and was excited to get a free salad for first timers. It came out with our wings. Both were delicious. The salad was served in a chilled bowl and the lettuce was fresh. It was a fantastic Caesar salad. The wings were tasty. 

Our pizza was delivered by wait staff. It too was delicious.

The atmosphere was upbeat, everyone seemed happy. There was a happy buzz going around. All in all, I'm anxious to go back..I'm glad the other places were too crowded. Next time I'm in neighborhood, I'll plan to go here. 

Great job folks."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of draught beers, the personal pizza is incredible value, their other pizzas are also awesome. Relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service was good and the food TASTED good. But we got so sick from it. We have been sick for 6 hours so far from it, FOOD POISONING. From the wings/celery or pretzel bites. Been up all night cannot sleep from the pain. Called them in the morning and spoke with a manager who seemed to not care so much. All he said was \"what did you order? I hope you feel better.\" Yeah I hope I feel better too I was feeling fine until I got food poisoning. Glad we wasted money on food that made us so sick. I hope nobody else gets sick . I'm sad how down-hill this place got.

Update: it's been 11 hours since and there's blood when I go to the restroom. I can't even believe a restaurant would do this to us. I'm going to my doctor now."}
{"text":"Don't go there and expect customer service.  Showed up on a Monday,  they had one customer and they wouldn't open the patio bar windows so we could sit on the patio.  Had to order my food to go and they never even bothered to ask if i wanted anything to drink while I'm waiting.  So glad their comfort was more important then a paying client."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours on Mill. They also have reverse happy hour. Their parmesan pretzels are amazing, and the pizza's are not too bad either. They have great sandwiches and a good beer selection. I would not suggest their bloody-mary's, but over all reasonably priced and a good place to eat!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times but this past weekend was one of my favorites.  We had gone to the Yelp event last week, in which mellow mushroom was there giving out gift cards/free bruschetta tickets.  I'm not usually a fan of bruschetta because the hard bread kills the roof of my mouth - but I thought I'd give this a shot.  It was delish.  The flavoring was amazing and the bread just right.  We also got a Meat Pizza.  We ate half of it and the other half some how ended up on the floor, slipping off the pizza stand.  We were devastated as the late night snack was something we were looking forward to!  Ashley B was our server, not only did she remember us from the Yelp event but she asked the kitchen to make us another small pizza ON THE HOUSE! Ahhhhhh so sweet of her."}
{"text":"I hate giving bad reviews but I have been three times now and hated it every time. The pizza has been soggy and the toppings fall off the crust. Crust is not good. Ordered salad w/ pine nuts on it and we got a whole two (2), yes we counted carefully...Great beer selection but otherwise meh! Other reviews seem okay so go and check it out, you might love it. Just putting in my vote."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I loved it! Their stuffed portobello was so good! Definitely recommend if you are going to have an appetizer!  Their pizza is delicious and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while we were in Charlotte and I thought the pizza was really good. I got the BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious and fresh. The only thing I wish they had were other options beside beer wine and soda. I love eating pizza with and iced tea or lemonade. But other than that, it was good!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the lack of vegan options. It was a hassle to get a pizza with no cheese. When I did, I had to pay for adding garlic but received no deduction for removing 3 kinds of cheese. 
I understand this a business, but wayyy overpriced!! Especially over priced for vegan and dairy free options. 
Definitely not a mellow experience for me! 
Do not order here!! Save your money for better food!"}
{"text":"Same old mellow. This is my 5th or 6th mellow that I've been too. But it was my first time in Charlotte. Same pot head ambiance, good choice of beers, a few TV for us sports fans and one of my top 3 pizza crust. It is a nice location and building, very clean and new.

If you are looking for quality pizza, with fresh toppings, and kind of a bar/laid back atmosphere it's a perfect spot."}
{"text":"Service was good, wings were good but both sandwiches, which were supposed to be best per server, the Philly and club had no flavor whatsoever accept the bread which was good."}
{"text":"Not sure how u can not love this place! The pizza is the best Ive ever had the pretzels well that just kicks A**. My husband and I tried this place because we just happened to drive by. We will now make this our regular Pizza joint. Our server was also wonderful!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here. Loved the smell going in and the decor was cool. Really good pizza, lots of fresh ingredients and the crust was the bomb-diggity!  Dad and I did a 50/50 house special and bbq chicken. Both were delish but after tasting, I'd do all bbq chicken next time. I'm just not into lots of topping. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday June 18th only for a quick drink & an appetizer. 
Many beers on tap, service was good.
Had the Meatball Trio-it was ok. Sauce could have had a bit more flavor for me, maybe spicier?
We will possibly come back again, to give this place more time and effort. Up to checking out more options on the menu.
The server did mentioned the Bruschetta is good. The Portobello (1) stuffed Mushroom appetizer was almost $10, it was to pricey for my taste!
Happy hour specials offered as well."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was well done,  good service but for a $20 medium pie there was no real wow factor,  good but $20 good."}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time for a work meeting, had a pizza and /shrug wasn't anything I would rave about.  Second time was a much different story.  Tried the Tempeh sandwich, not even knowing what tempeh was, but wow, glad I did!  I am not a vegan, vegetarian nor do I typically order tofu type items off a menu, however, this sandwich is enough to keep me interested in going back."}
{"text":"I recommend the happy hour or reverse happy hour for drinks. The pretzel with beer cheese is also amazing. That's about it though. Service is meh. Pizza meh. Prices meh..."}
{"text":"Nothing really special IMO.  They had solid pizza and beers.  The location is killer though - right between BofA Stadium and BB&T Ballpark.  Perfect to grab right before the game or after.  

Happy hour gets insanely busy because of baseball and suits.  I would avoid unless you are really craving pizza.  Uninspiring review, but uninspiring place.

dmo out"}
{"text":"I'm a die hard mellow mushroom fan. Pizza is killer so is the staff and the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Although the pizza is good the service is slow and our orders always come out at different times. Even if you ask for appetizer items to come out with everyone else's meal it all comes out at random intervals. Good luck getting a drink refill here! Better luck sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Finally a place that northern phoenicians can go to to get good beer.  Very much more like a pizza joint than a bar even though they have a wide variety of good beers, both local, microbrew and imports.  A little more like North Scottsdale prices than North Phoenix prices though which is funny since they are going to open one in North Scottsdale from what they told me. The pizzas were heavily crust oriented with a sweet crust, almost honeylike.Being the only real game in the area they will do good so if you like pizza and beer check them out."}
{"text":"So I've heard many a good thing about Mellow Mushroom and have been itching to get myself over to the now not-so-new location on Selwyn Ave. Tonight I finally graced the restaurant with my presence.

I was impressed with the sheer size of the restaurant which doesn't look that big from the street, it also wasn't that crowded for a Tuesday night (not that I expected it to be). 

I went against the grain and got a salad instead of a pizza (I eat pizza a lot). There were plenty of decent salad choices on the menu, I decided to go Greek (anything with feta screams my name). The waiter recommended the Esperanza dressing so I went for it, and thank goodness for that! The salad itself was H-UGE (the regular is more than enough for leftovers) and the dressing was perhaps some one of the most scrumptious I've had - definitely get it if you go.

The only downside was the wait for the checks. And if that's the only downside I'll give it another go and try the pizza when I return."}
{"text":"The food is good, but it's 80 degrees inside... Too uncomfortable to eat 

The blonde bartender mikale is the bitchest person I've ever met in the service industry. I will not be back because of her and her attitude. Fire her!"}
{"text":"While the decor is fantastic, the host stand employees are immature and could give two sh*ts! In the many times that we have been there whether it's the two of us or a big group, they seem like they are there to just hang out and talk. Not something you see when you are first greeted. 
Service has always been great. Food is good, but the pizza, way over priced for mediocre pie! A small pizza, 4 not so big pieces is high! And just for a cheese pizza! Eek! 

At least there are other things on the menu that are pretty good, Id come back as I have been but last night will be the last of the pizza!"}
{"text":"Gave a decent amount of time since last visit.  Seated quickly.  Staff polite.  VERY busy, but they got the order correct and food was fresh.  MUCH better experience.  Still slammed and oddly organized location. . .but they're trying hard."}
{"text":"Rude hostess staff and servers are clearly limited. Went in on a Friday for lunch and was told they'd have a fourty five minute wait because they only had 2 servers scheduled. Really?!? Not smart. Pizza was tasty and as noted by others, expensive. I'm sad to say, it's not worth a 45-minute wait. I won't go near this place on the weekends, let the rest of south Charlotte wait in line and skip on over to the other place by 'Toast' on Rea Rd. Or - True pizza by Target is a great family friendly option. Sorry mellow, I'll save my cravings for your Asheville location where they clearly know how to staff appropriately and have the best service....."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the food is great but the service was ok (not bad but not great).  This rating is based on an attempt to order a pizza.  I work at a near-by University and tried to order a pizza for pick-up.  We were ordering pizza for an event on campus.  Our in-house dining services is preparing our pizzas but we needed a vegan and gluten-free pizza option.  So that removed the normal pizza places including our campus dining services.  Last year we used Mellow Mushroom.  I was hoping to place the order for pick-up later in the day and pay for it over the phone (which your standard delivery places do).  First, the person who answered the phone definitely made it sound like I was being a big burden with the request for pick-up later in the day.  Then, when I asked if I could pay for it (so a student could pick-up the pizza) I was told they needed to get the manager.  When the manager took the phone they stated that due to an incident last week where someone committed identity theft they could not help me.  The individual didn't ask any questions or try to understand what I was hoping to do or where I was.  I understand how people may try to scam a system and I'm sure pizza places get a fair share of scam calls.  It would be really easy though to confirm who I was and that the order was legit.  Apparently, one incident is enough for them to change their policy on phone orders.  It's up to them, they must have done the math that the business from these orders isn't worth it.  Their customer service could definitely use some work.  I told them I would take my business elsewhere.  I easily found another pizza restaurant nearby that would work with us."}
{"text":"Great customer service and very nice atmosphere. The pizza was good but not the best I've tried. Love the view. I would definitely come back and try something else."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome and most of the time you come in service is pretty awesome. I had a little snag the last trip where it looked like maybe the server was having an off day (but everyone does so no biggie). Overall really great pizza, prices are a little on the high side once you get drinks and appetizers but you get what you pay for. All the food is top notch."}
{"text":"I wasn't terribly hungry, so I just had the Muffaletta Cheese Bread appetizer.

It was amazing! And a meal in and of itself!

Good beer selection, nice patio.

This particular location isn't near me, so I wouldn't likely return, or if I did, often.

But I would go back if I were in the area."}
{"text":"All in all, our visit to Mellow Mushroom was a good one.  There were 11 of us because we were celebrating our niece's birthday.  So, we got to try a lot of different items. 
For Starters we tried the wings, pretzels (with the beer cheese) and the spinach artichoke dip.  They were out of the mushroom soup, which seems a little odd.  The wings were hot on the outside, but frozen in the middle (yes, actually frozen).  At first they didn't believe us that they were still frozen, but we finally convinced them.  They were apologetic and replaced the order.  The pretzels were really good, but the beer cheese was a little thick and gummy.  The marinara was great.  The spinach artichoke dip was excellent.  As a matter of fact dipping the pretzels in the artichoke dip was the best combo of all of the apps.

Next we had our entrees.  We got three pizzas (each had two different toppings), one calzone, one salad and one stuffed portabella mushroom.  The pizzas were good.  One was really good (I think it was the one that was half ham and half pepperoni).  The \"Loaded Potato Pie\" that was on half of one was tasty, but a little weird (not sure that I can get used to sliced baked potatoes on pizza).  The other half of that one had the \"Rib Eye Pie\" topping  and although it was OK, for the price it was very sparse on the meat and therefore not very meaty tasting.

My biggest issue was the Calzone.  First of all I think $9.49 is a little pricey for a cheese calzone, but I wanted to try them, so I bit the bullet.  I noticed on their website that they had a \"Steak and Cheese\" Calzone, so I asked the waiter and he said they could make one (I didn't ask how much extra, so I guess that's my fault).  That brought the price of my Calzone to well over $12.00.  I would accept that since I didn't ask the price, but I could barely find any meat on it and fully one half had no meat at all.

My other complaint would be the extremely slow service.  I will cut them a little slack on this since there were 11 of us and they are fairly new with obviously inexperienced staff.  They were nice enough and you could tell they were trying.

I think they have a pretty decent Happy Hour offering and I will go back a couple of times to see if anything improves, but right now I can't go over three stars."}
{"text":"It seriously blows my freaking mind that this place only has 3 stars. Maybe the fancy-ass City North crowd is too cool for a little Mellow? Whatever the case, I give everything here a SOLID five stars.

The food? Fantastical. The pretzels with Abita TurboDog beer cheese? 1 word: amazeballs. Or is that supposed to be 2 words? Whatever. It's awesome. And the pizza! Oy vey. They come up with some of the funkiest topping combinations - that I would never try without prompting - but the quality and tender loving care with which everything is applied and baked to perfection just makes it work. And on the rare occasion that you come to a pizza-and-beer joint looking to eat light, their salads have never disappointed me either.

The service? I've literally never been less than thrilled with it. We usually sit at the bar, and everyone we've been served by has been friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. The bartenders genuinely seem to care about whether or not we're as totally enthused about our beer selection as they are, and that makes me do a little happy jig.

The atmosphere? Love. From the decor to the music (usually) and everything in between, I'm a fan. I feel that, if I was a man, I would model my man-cave after this spot. If I had a man cave.

*Edit* After reading some of the reviews, I've noted that a lot of the negativity is due to \"slow\" service. I've never found it particularly slow, but I guess I would never think to come to a restaurant with \"Mellow\" in the title and expect a Pizza Hut wait time. But I guess that's just me :)"}
{"text":"Great place for variety of pizza toppings. Tried the vegetable and white pizza both my excellent. Love that there is parmesan on the crust."}
{"text":"The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  However the food was not worth the price I thought I was eating at Peter Piper's with the quality that was served.  I ordered the HUGE portobello mushroom and received two small ones that were flattened  The only thing worth going back for was the beer on tap since they do not produce it.  I would say over all the best part was walking out the door.  The pricing on the menu was like a Scottsdale restaurant but without the atmosphere.  I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have visited a few Mellow Mushrooms in South Carolina and always had a delicious meal or unique beer that I enjoyed, so I was really excited to learn one was opening up in Rocky River.  They kept up really well with the funky, psychedelic theme.  The restaurant contains crazy colored walls and outrageous decorations.
I went on Thursday evening for happy hour and sat at a table in the bar area. Happy hour is a great deal that includes a selection of half priced appetizers, $4.00 glasses of wine and discounted beer.  Happy hour is until 7 pm.  Some of the appetizers include spinach and artichoke dip, bruchetta, and hummus. I opted for a glass of the house pino grigio and it was pretty delicious.  We also split a half off app called drunk pretzel buddies.  This item is not listed on the menu but our waitress recommended them after sharing the discounted list with us.  They were delicious!! Salted pretzel bites with a creamy beer cheese dip.  Something so simple yet so good.  For dinner we split the greek salad and a kosmic karma pizza.  
The salad was loaded with feta cheese, kalamata olives, banana peppers, tomatoes, cucumber, and shredded carrots.  I find it more rare these days to get a good helping of veggies on salads, but this one was definitely filling.   They don't have a greek dressing  but their esparanza dressing is similar to a well seasoned creamy italtian and went really great with the salad.
Our pizza was also very good.  I prefer my crust a bit more crispy and there were a few parts of the pizza I felt should have been cooked longer but over all it was good.
We went on a Thursday and found out the trivia was happen from 7pm-9pm.  If you are looking for a more quiet intaminte feel I would avoid this place because once the trivia starts over the speakers it can get pretty loud.
Over all I would return to try another pizza or sandwich.  I felt as if their pizzas are a little on the pricey side.  A small 8 inch pizza for approximately $14.00 seems a little much for me and it is not the best pizza out there.  I recommend going with friends and getting a medium to split!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. The Holy shitake is to die for. Great drink specials and nice bartenders"}
{"text":"I took my father here a couple of months ago. We had a wonderful time. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. Unfortunately, she had to deal with some jerk over a stupid Groupon. It does not help that he was completely wasted, but making a you know what of himself. I ordered an Irish Trashcan and they were very tasty. Another table saw what we ordered and wanted them as well! I like to come after 10 when their happy hour is!"}
{"text":"While searching for something new and different during our stay in Chandler, we were walking around Mill Avenue. The better half suggested trying Mellow Mushroom - fantastic choice. 

It was pretty busy but we were able to grab a table on the patio to people watch while waiting for our Mighty Meaty pizza.

It was amazing. I've always said that, when you have bacon on a pizza, crumbles just won't do. We had honest to goodness chucks o' bacon as well as sausage, pepperoni, ground beef and ham. I was in heaven and wished I had a bigger stomach.  The crust was interesting, too. I loved it.

When we were stuffed, we decided to take a little dessert back to the hotel with us - honey cinnamon pretzels. They are probably much better if you eat them right out of the oven but even after a quick trip in the hotel micro, they weren't too bad!

Since we aren't drinkers, I can't comment on the bar/drinks situation but the set up was quite impressive with a ton of taps.

They'd be a cool addition to Tucson - maybe in Main Gate Square or close by. 

Great service
Great food

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"House special is my absolute favorite!! Plus the pretzels with beer cheese are AMAZING. The staff is always super nice and I have never gotten bad service! Always an overall great experience. :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food the pizza is some of the best in town and the atmosphere is above par."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom isn't exactly the sort of place I'd ordinarily go. Woodstock murals, giant hippy-painted school-buses in the middle of the dining, and awkward wrap-around booths just don't quite appeal to my more refined dining sensibilities. But, my coworkers dig it. And the one on Selwyn has a reputation for slow, inattentive service - which is perfect when you and your coworkers are looking to extend your one-hour workday lunch break into a 2.5 hour marathon. 
During the carpool-carride over, the majority of us joked about how terrible the service would be. Shauna, our lone female (and lone optimist), righteously defended MM's honor. \"You guys are so harsh,\" she groaned. \"We got bad service one time... and now it's like they're the worst place ever.\" 
We were quick to point out to Shauna multiple specific examples of the bad service we had received on several separate occasions: 
\"Remember the time Mark had to go behind the bar and pour his own beer because the waiter never came back?\" 
\"Remember the time we were seated for 47 minutes before anyone took our drink order?\" 
\"Remember the time we had three different (lousy) waiters because none of them knew whose section we were in?\" 
Nevertheless, we keep coming back, hopeful each time that the experience will change. It never does. 
Last Friday we were welcomed and seated promptly. Out waitress approached, comely and upright, with jet-black hair, loose but not sloppy clothing, and a lovely porcelain-skinned face - plain and inexpressive... but not entirely lifeless. She introduced herself with a breathless murmur: Kim, Amy, Amber... I dunno. I don't think she even knew. 
\"Hi,\" we all said with genuine enthusiasm. She just sorta stood there and teetered like a weeble.
\"We need drinks,\" I declared. \"Any specials?\" 
\"Um...\" Kim/Amy looked bewildered. 
Bart leaned forward and read off the specials on the chalkboard behind her. The last one was a \"Mystery Beer: $3\"
\"What's the 'mystery beer'?\" I asked. 
Kim/Amy shrugged. \"It's a mystery.\" 
I was intrigued. So I ordered one. (Turns out the mystery beer is just a random bottle of a crappy beer like Grolsch or Longboard or something else they're trying to get rid of that shouldn't be sold for more than a buck...) 
Bart cleared his throat. \"Is there a lunch special?\" he asked, catching Kim/Amy completely off-guard.  
\"What day is it?\" she asked us, sincerely. 
\"Um... Friday.\" 
\"Oh, then yeah. We have the special.\" 
We all, then, politely extended a protracted pause. When no further information was offered, we were compelled to pry: \"Oh yeah? So... what is the special?\" 
\"It's a slice and a salad,\" Kim/Amy replied, quite matter-of-factly. 
\"What kind of slices can I choose from?\" Bart asked. 
\"You can get anything you want,\" She said. 
\"Oh!\" Bart's face lit up as he started scanning through the specialty pies in the menu's center page. \"So, I can get the Mighty Meaty?\" 
As if he should have known, Amy/Kim halted him sternly, \"No, you can't get those. You have to make your own.\" 
Bart, a bit flummoxed, tried to reason this out. \"Oh, so I can't choose a specialty pizza but I can get whatever toppings I want?\" 
Kim/Amy nodded. \"Yeah, you can get whatever you want. I mean, you have to pay for toppings.\" 
Bart, now more flabbergasted than flummoxed, persisted. \"Ok, so... toppings are extra?\" 
\"I mean... you get one,\" she said. 
Now the picture was forming more clearly. An audible \"ahhh!\" of clarity was released by half the table. \"So, it's a one-topping slice and a salad?\" 
Kim/Amy nodded. Now we were getting somewhere. But then, as if she were somehow made uncomfortable by the sudden moment of clarity, she decided to throw us an additional curveball. \"Or you can get two slices.\" 
Bart, now just being a jack-ass, forced her hand. \"Oh, so instead of toppings I can just get two slices - but does cheese count as a topping?\" 
 \"No, a slice and a salad.\" 
We all laughed. And she laughed too. Not sure if she knew it was an at-you-not-with-you type thing. 
Orders were placed. Most of us got the special, some got sandwiches. I ordered pretzels for the table (garlic bread in the shape of a pretzel with marinara for dipping). 
The side-salads came out promptly. Unspectacular - just some greens with onion and tomato sprinkled in. Then, we waited. Took about half an hour for the food to arrive (the appetizer brought at the same time as the entrees... sigh). And we did get one or two more rounds of drinks served in that time. So, all in all, not too bad. 
The food is... mediocre. Greasy slices of pizza with run-of-the-mill ingredients. The slices are large, so there's that. The guys who got sandwiches were impressed and noted that \"sandwiches are the way to go here\". Good to know. 
Checks were a bit of a situation. We had to each recount what exactly we'd ordered since Kim/Amy evidently didn't split it up as she took things down. No big deal. It's Mellow Mushroom. 
1.5 hours in and out. Best experience I've ever had there."}
{"text":"The beer selection is good.  That's it for the positives here...

My main issue with this place isn't even the food.  I believe MM may be in violation of a health code with regard to their bathroom water.  Shortly after eating here I got sick, and I haven't been sick in years! There is no hot water in either bathroom, my fianc√© confirmed the issue in the women's rr and mentioned it to an employee. At the time I didn't think much of it until I woke up sick. There was a little kid in the men's room that couldn't even keep his hands in the water for more than a few seconds because it was ice cold.  With so many people eating here and essentially not being able to clean their hands properly, assuming employees too, is pretty gross. I only hope other areas of the restaurant like the dishwasher have hot water! MM get this fixed asap!

The pizza was ok, I expected a little more. The crust was really greasy. I think they brushed it with oil or butter after baking which I am not a fan of. If your pizza is good you shouldn't have to 'butter it up' afterwards.

The service was under par as well. It was hard to get drinks at the bar without having to waive someone down every time. One server took our food menus away without asking for our order then of course we had to bust out the waive again.

I was hoping this would be my new spot, it has/had potential. It is hard for me not to like a pizza place honestly but MM was a big gross letdown. If they get the water issue fixed I'd try it again but not for a few months until things calm down."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this location but my boyfriend wanted some pizza for lunch.. this location was nice and big, very clean and the staff are friendly.. but the pizza and the Greek salad  itself was just okay... nothing to special about them... I don't know if I'll be back... rather just go to Grimaldi's that's to far from here and enjoy a better made pizza.."}
{"text":"Went for dinner early on a Friday night, about 6 PM. Was expecting a zoo because we were on Mill and were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately, no wait, with a party of six. Server was young but experienced, had no trouble handling our group, and was helpful and accommodating the entire time. Kept drinks full (actually got ahead of us, she was so on top of things), and was kind enough to share that even on the smallest pizza, you can get half and half. Sold!

We ordered cheesy bread as an appetizer. It's just okay. Not as garlicky as we were expecting and a little over-crisp and dry.

I got the potato pizza on half and the Mega Veggie on the other half. Mega Veggie was good, but the potato pizza was outstanding.

Husband's buffalo chicken ranch pizza was also pretty good. General four-star concensus around our table. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Everytime I've gone to this location I have had a great experience. My waiters / waitresses have been very tentative. They also have a great wing sauce selection and craft beer selection."}
{"text":"The beer selection and variety, in one word:   WOW.  The food; I enjoyed Philosopher's Pie - steak meat , portobello, artichoke, garlic olive oil, feta and yummy Greek salty olives.  This was very YUM and fresh ingredients worth the price.  The dessert:  I didn't try it yet but the picture of the brownie like cake with ice cream and chocolate on top makes me want to go back sooner rather than later.  The ambience:  I enjoyed the funky music playing.  It was an interesting mix of all decades and some other traditional music mixed in. The service:  Wonderful, fast and friendly.   I hope this place makes it, the happy hour seems an amazing deal too.  This well could be my new hangout on the way home from work. The menu looks like you can just about try a new beer every week for a year or more and never have the same one twice.  Recommended."}
{"text":"The Manager Kevin and his team are the best. Back in May Kevin helped host a prom party for my son and his friends. It went of without a hitch. This last Saturday we hosted a party of 27 for the guitar player of the band I manage 21st bday. Once again Kevin and his team were awesome! They made the reservation, followed up, and had the room ready when the guests arrived. They also helped me with the cake which was very cool of them. I would highly recommend this location if you are looking to have a laid back yet special occasion in the middle of the most happening area in Tempe! And of course the pizza is off the hook, and so is the beer selection!"}
{"text":"Good food but a long wait and somewhat overpriced. Could do without the pretentious clientele and noise. I fully expected to see someone walk in with a chihuahua in their purse."}
{"text":"I have never not had a good experience here. The food is delicious, made as you order. Beer is cold. Pizza is warm. Wings are AWESOME. Everything is so reasonably priced for the quality. I've always been a hippie at heart, so of course I'm in love with the decor and the atmosphere. Definitely a 5 in my book."}
{"text":"Giving four stars. Stellar gluten free pie I tried with a friend who eats a special diet. It was good. I'd order it again even without her recommendation. Beer list was full also. Located in the east end of River. Near Whole Foods and Sweet Melissa."}
{"text":"I fell in love with Mellow Mushroom while living in Georgia and after moving to the CLE area last year we were glad to see one around. We finally went this past Saturday after the RV show. There was 10 of us and and we were seated quickly. The food was great but here are the reasons for getting a 4 out of 5 stars: 
1. We were seated at a high table. This really isn't a horrible thing except for the fact that we had a baby. This location isn't equipped with high chairs for high top tables, I felt obligated to hold my baby the entire time because I didn't feel safe keeping his carrier on a chair, but that's ok because I don't recall them boasting about being kid friendly so I wasn't overly aggravated by this. 
2. We ordered pretzels as an appetizer and they were rolled thinner than I prefer so they were a little on the crispy side, so maybe next time I will ask for thicker rolled pretzels. Again no big deal. 
3. I wasn't a fan of their BBQ sauce. But that's my problem not theirs. I prefer a sweeter sauce theirs didn't taste sweet it was more smokey. 

There are also a few reasons I enjoyed our visit as well. 
1. Our server, Marlow. She was great! Friendly kind and knew her stuff. Let us know that things would take longer cause they were fresh etc. I don't think anyone waited for a refill. 
2. I ordered the funky q chicken pizza. Delish! I felt like their was chicken and or bacon in every bite. 

I will definitely suggest this Mellow Mushroom to anyone who asks!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Mellow Mushroom because of their vegan pizza option. You have to pay $3 extra for vegan cheese, but it's understandable since Daiya is expensive. I have brought tons of friends here and they've all loved it. Yesterday, my boyfriend and I came for his first vegan pizza. He's a picky eater, but after picking off all the veggies, he seemed to enjoy it. The service is always outstanding and even when they're packed the timing is great. 
Not to mention their huge list of 48 beers on tap!! They even have Papago (which I love!) 
If only they were a bit cheaper (or didn't charge extra for vegan cheese!)"}
{"text":"The Air Conditioning is not working at this location and staff do not know why...The bartender was not even interested in providing a response on why it was so hot,  all that he said \"this is what im dealing with\"...The restrooms were a mess and not being kept clean.  Try to Enjoy a pizza and beer on patio until management  buys a fan or fixes A/C...it is cooler outside!!!"}
{"text":"Obviously a glutton for punishment- been here 3 times and EVERY time our service is ATROCIOUS. The pie is amazing- but cold when it gets to us.

And seriously... Management stands around texting?! EVERY time we have been there. 
I'll buy the pie to go next time if ever a next time.

Happy Hours prices - STILL TOO EXPENSIVE 
(drinks are cheaper and more quantity at other places)
Happy Hour food - Over priced, and not that great 
Pie- Awesome, you should try it for sure..... BUT YES VERY PRICEY

just too expensive of a place to continue going, when the service is sooo bad."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the Mellow Mushroom concept.  I think this place has a great theme and atmosphere.  
Very laid back hippie, stoner vibe.
My daughter absolutely loved the bus and the fact we could dine inside of it
Perfect, good atmosphere and entertaining my 3 year old.  
We started with the Brushetta app.  This Brushetta is perfect for me.  It is served with feta and a balsamic glaze.  I will go back for this alone.
I am from NY and love my pizza so with that being said their pizza is a little different than the tradition NY style I am use to.  They have a sweeter crust and it is a bit thicker than my liking.  We did get the house pizza which came with a generous amount of toppings.  The pizza was good but it is not the best I have ever had.  
The beer selection was huge which was great, I ordered 2 of the \"dirty hippy\" beers they had on the menu.  This was actually really good, it was Sweet Water 420 layered with Guinness VERY TASTY! 

I will be definitely be back and recommend everyone to try it out if they have never been to a Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"Just went for drinks.. I wasn't in the mood for pizza.. or any of that stuff on the menu. Seeing \"Jada\" (Sushi) made me want sushi. Great space, not too crowded. I was told it gets PACKED on game days...."}
{"text":"I have been eating regularly at this Mellow Mushroom since it opened in 2012, and it seems to have deteriorated in recent months. Visited for dinner today at about 5:30 and was seated right away but had a terrible time getting the attention of our server. Tried to order a bruschetta appetizer for Happy Hour and was told they were out of bread. The server acted annoyed that we did not want to substitute another appetizer. Then he disappeared for about 45 minutes, showing up at our table again only after we had finished eating 10 minutes earlier and were waiting to request a box and our check. He apologized for not being around more, saying that he had had to take over tables for another server who had shown up drunk. I can empathize with the server, but someone on the staff should have helped him out more. Customers should not be made to suffer due to a staffing issue. I also noticed that many things in the restaurant were dingy or dirty--sticky menus, sticky table, water glass with lipstick mark, and multiple people were vaping outside on the \"no smoking\" patio. Disgusting. Seems poorly managed compared to in the past or to other locations (Norterra or MM in the SE US). I really love the concept of Mellow Mushroom and hope they will up their game."}
{"text":"This review is not a critique on the food or wait staff service - both of which were fine.  It is, however, a critique on the inappropriate remarks made by the hostesses on duty regarding my son's need to bring in a pillow to sit on.  Apparently, it was necessary for them to make derisive comments about his need for said pillow - both when he arrived and as we were leaving.  My son has a medical condition that necessitates the use of a seating aid.  This should not have been an object of ridicule for anyone, but apparently the shallow idiot hostesses felt the need to make fun of him.  I would recommend anyone with a disability not dining at this restaurant since any type of special accommodation might make one an object of ridicule.  BTW this happened during the evening dining service.  Who knows, maybe the day shift hostesses have more compassion.  If I could give zero stars, I would."}
{"text":"45 minutes later and we are still waiting on a large pizza. Staff hasn't interacted with us much at all. Be ready to wait and feel forgotten.
Update:  I talked to the manager and decided to give it another try. We had a much better experience. The food was great and service was attentive this time."}
{"text":"Fire Devon or train your staff correctly. Will never be back nor would I ever recommend this place to anyone that I love. Horrific service to the point of embarrassment. Bar rescue, help this place. After being in the industry for 11 years, I've never received worse service as a whole."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is our family's go to place for dinner. The food doesn't skimp on flavor and they have the best happy hour in the valley. Our first experience many months ago our server was Anthony. He went out of his way to walk us through the menu and he blew us away with his knowledge of the bar menu. He's polite, efficient, knowledgeable and by far the friendliest server at Mellow. 
We've come back week after week always asking for Anthony. The food is awesome, but Anthony keeps us coming back. 
If you're looking for a great night out with or without the kiddos, Mellow Mushroom is the place to go. Make it even more awesome by requesting Anthony."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out, when calling they told me an hour and 15 minutes, ended up having to wait another 15 minutes when picking up,  so a total of 1-1/2 hours for carry out. That's crazy !!! The shitakii mushroom pizza and spinach dip was good but part of building a loyal customer base is having efficient service. The spinach dip container was only 1/4 full so my suggestion is to get a smaller to go container. Will probably be a while before trying again, I'll stick to my trusted and true pizza place Angelo's."}
{"text":"I'm not over by Selwyn all that often but when I am, it's typically for Mellow Mushroom. I've stopped in on occasion for dinner and always end up getting the pizza... ummm... it's MM... that's what they are known for. 

The pizzas can be a bit pricier but look at the menu and you'll see why. The larges are indeed quite large and comes with toppings aplenty! Worth the price. You can get your typically pepperoni, veggies and whatever else here but I adore a pizza parlor that tops their pies with a variety of sauces as well, like the pesto swirl. If you're a mushroom fan, grab the holy shiitake pie - topped with mushrooms, onions, garlic aioli and black truffle oil - whaaaat?!

The draft selection is extensive as well and the last time I went Mellow was doing a pint night with Sam Adams... good beer and a free glass? Two, please. 

The service is excellent. From the host to the server to the management, all I've ever received has been supreme customer service. Nice job, Mellow. I need to swing by and see you all soon!"}
{"text":"Other Mushrooms are better. 
This location seems great for game day as the Panthers play just minutes from here. 
But I'm here on business. And I'm vegan. And I'm hungry. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who has similar needs. 
The beer selection is sweet. Bartender Alexis is super helpful. 
But...i ordered a double tofu salad and couldn't believe that six little slivers of tofu was a double. I had to triple up. And that's not good for the budget nor did it even come close to a 1/2 block of soybeans.
It's a bad value, but again, this place likely kills it on Sundays when i can only imagine the line is out the door for reasonably priced beers. That seems to be the focus. 
I'm not coming back, tho."}
{"text":"So, 

 Again I was told no by a restaurant.  Why is it so hard to make a pizza 1/4 cheese and rest something else. How can a hospitality establishment tell guess no when we are the ones that pay there bills. I have been a chef for 18yrs. Opened many restaurants and never told a guest no. I currently am the chef for an Asian restaurant and I have made shrimp scampi for a guest because they asked if I could... making guest happy is what this business is all about and no we can do that should not even be said to any guest unless you don't have the ingredients to do so or if your extremely busy then it's understanding. But something so simple..... really you can't do it or just wont.... well I guess I am not coming here again..."}
{"text":"It was really good. I had the beer cheese and the magical mystery pizza. There was a lot of flavor and tasty."}
{"text":"A service disaster every time, but today takes the cake. Did not see our appetizers until 1 hr after ordering, then forgotten pizzas almost 1.5 hrs in.  No explanations or apologies. We had 7 kids, thank God for technology. Lunch on a friday at pizza joint should not last 2.5 hrs. Ballantyne is a disaster, need to take notes from uptown location which is always on point."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places whenever I go to Austin. Then I found out one was opened on Mill, I was in heaven! The BEST pizza I've had."}
{"text":"Just couldn't get into the crust , toppings seemed to be good quality stuff, sauce was good , service was friendly yet slooooow."}
{"text":"The bartender Leigh was assume, very attentive,great beer selection, we ordered a medium conavour, flavor was good but it lacked in ingredients (5 piece's of bacon) really, for the price it should have ample amounts of ingredients, so we did not feel we got our money's worth"}
{"text":"I have visited this place several times during happy hour. Just was amazed with there draft beer varity,delicious appetizers and amazing environment. The past couple tiems Ive gone the waiters have been . They proivde you hospitality and just a great time. I recommend everyone to pass by and try there food and drink specials. Amazing place!!"}
{"text":"Prices for pizza were rather high but the quality matched the price.   The staff and servers were helpful"}
{"text":"STAFF+TIME-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff service was quite nice however pizza took 40 minutes to arrive but I wasn't in a rush so I didn't mind. My last visit about 2 years ago took about 40 minutes as well for the food to be ready so I expected that much.

FOOD---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The pizza was incredibly greasy. When the small pizza arrived to my table there was a small pool of oil in the center. When I took a slice off, the oil dripped onto my plate. I tried to soak some off with my napkin but the oil soaked right through each one. I used parmesan cheese to soak up some of the grease so my pizza would not drip. The toppings were tasty but i had to use my napkin very often because my lips was covered in grease after every bite. I took half of the pizza home because it was so overwhemling with grease. The next day the top and bottom of the to-go box was covered in a  thick layer of grease all over from just two small slices of pizza.

END THOUGHT--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am sure there are other great choices of pizza on the menu, I was afraid I ordered something wrong again like my first visit. 

End of story, do not order the shiitake(shit-take on) mushroom pizza.

{"text":"Mellow mushroom is terrible.  I have never written a review before but this place is a grotesquely racist establishment and i never want to return to it ever again.  I would give it negative 100 stars if i could."}

{"text":"What a disappointment. After positive experiences at the Tempe location, I was happy to see MM moving in to the old Rock Bottom location. My excitement had turned south after each of my three visits.  Take out order wrong, twice to start. Apparently any beer over 7% is only served in a 12 oz goblet, but you still get charged the 20 oz price at $7. Ordered pizza with 'extra sauce' it was dry with barely any. Also, cannot turn on the tv audio during a Cards game??  Seriously?  Yes the families like football too, but are forced to listen to jitterbug!  ???"}

{"text":"Pizza and fresh pretzels how could you go wrong? We ended up getting \"The Philosopher\" which had kalamata olives, portobello mushroom caps, artichoke hearts with an oil and garlic base. The best part was that it came with steak initially and they put it on the side for us so I could still enjoy my protein. Next time I am going to try the salt and mustard pretzels.  After the pretzels, a 14inch pizza and 1 ice tea we bounced with a little under a 30$ bill which seemed a little much but it was good and they took good care of us."}
{"text":"This mellow mushroom location is not great. We waited a longer than normal time to be seated because when we entered the restaurant there was no host to greet us or seat us. After we were seated, we ordered drinks which took very long to get to our table, even though it didn't look that busy. We ordered food which again, took very long. However our food was very good. Our server was kind but the service was not anything to write home about. 

TL;DR- Good food. Long wait even when it appears to be slow."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to be giving mellow mushroom a 3 star review, but the last experience we had was quite underwhelming. I do not recommend the veggie hoagie. Very sad sandwich with nothing to talk about. No sauce, very plain. The thai dye pizza with tofu on the other hand, I highly recommend. The blend of sauces is the perfect balance between sweet and salty. We also had the brownie sundae. Which was meh unfortunately. I wouldn't spend money on it again. 

We didn't have the best dine in experience. Our pizza came with chicken instead of tofu. Our plates were taken away and we were not brought new ones. When we asked for a sundae with ice cream, we got just the brownie. So we had to send that back too. And lastly, when we got the sundae, we were told they were out of spoons.....next time, we will take our pizza home!"}
{"text":"Okay,  so this is the first time I've ever been to the Mello Mushroom.   Worst eating experience in a long time!  Everyone one else in my party really enjoyed their meals.   The waitress totally forgot my order!   Everyone else got their meals while I sat waiting intently.   I was so looking forward to my pepperoni calzone!  Never came!   The waitress came back once!   When she finally did come back,  she said that \"THEY\" forgot to make it.   It didn't even come until everyone else was done eating so I told her to please make it to go.  Well she brought it, it wasn't even a pepperoni calzone it was a chicken calzone!  At least the manager was nice enough to comp my meal.   The finally topper was when I got home,  it was filled with bell peppers!   Not my favorite veggie!  Needless to say, this was my first and last time eating there!"}
{"text":"We came here on the night of the super bowl and the hostesses just said \"we're full\". Should have left then but we checked out the bar. There were 3 empty seats so we just went there. There was a 2-top and a 4-top open behind us.

We got wings for an appetizer and they were hands down the worst we've ever had. So dry and tasteless. Only got 5 and are 2... Barely. They took them away and we told the waitress but she said said \"ok\" (not letting us know if it would be handled / free). 

After we are no one came up to clear our plates or offer a box. We waited until someone came up so we could order dessert but the bartenders just stood there talking to each other. 35 minutes later someone finally came up and we ordered then.

Never coming back... One of worst Mellow Mushrooms ice ever been to."}
{"text":"I love the pizza here!  I get tomatoes, basil and meatballs with mozzarella. Plenty of tvs and a nice bar. The upstairs iPad like tables are awesome but last time we were here the waitress forgot that we were up there."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is a fun, eclectic restaurant with great food. If you're into non traditional pizzas and hippy decor, this may be the place for you. Start with an appetizer. The spinach artichoke dip is the best I've ever had. It's super creamy and delicious!My favorite pizza is the red skin potato which has potatoes, bacon, onions, sour cream and a spicy ranch drizzle. While I've been a Mellow Mushroom fan since they've opened, recently I've had some disappointing experiences. The menu has been constantly changing so you're never quite sure what you'll find, even though they'll usually make your old staple if you request it. Most concerning though is the service. They are constantly understaffed, sometimes with only one server for the entire restaurant. I'd suggest trying Mellow Mushroom but proceed with caution. You'll never be quite sure what you're going to get."}
{"text":"Great mellow. Has a bus inside to sit and kids to play. Food is great. Mushroom club and lil chef salad were great."}
{"text":"This place is good and always packed. Happy hour is great and the food is good. The service needs to get better. Went there last night and the server was okay. One thing that bothered me was the fact that her and no one else would ever grab our dirty plates off of the table. Literally had no room for our pizza when the food runner ran it out. She dropped it and didn't bother to take any plates or ask if we needed anything... like new plates. Who would want to eat pizza on a plate that had salad and dressing all over it?"}
{"text":"Umm.  What are these \"hippies\" smoking?

I only ask because:
a) this isn't a 60s-ish place.  Just because you calling your appetizers \"munchies\" (I get it!  Like I'm stoned!) and you have a psychadelic menu cover doth not make a hippie place.    This was like the bastard lovechild of TGI Friday's and a 5 and Diner.
b) This is some of the heaviest pizza I've ever had.  And not in a good way (like traditional Chicago pie).  You'd better like crust because you get a ton of it.  We did a cheese and a BBQ chicken. 
c) Tomato bisque soup is not bisquey.  My wife thought it tasted like tomato sauce.  When she sent it back, the server guessed right \"Did you think it tasted like red sauce?\"  Apparently we weren't the first.  That ain't a good sign, friends.
d) It isn't cheap.  You want good, cheap hippie food?  Go to Two Hippies Beach Stand @ 5th and Camelback.
e) Where's the peace on Earth?  It is loud.  We got sat in the back (near the kitchen) which was better.. but up front?   Find me an eating experience where loud helps your experience.  I never notice the noise levels in restaurants.  This was madness.

On the plus side, there are a lot of beers.  They are expensive but it looks like a great deal at happy hour (which is 2-6 M-F).  

Northsiders, don't let the convenience trick yourselves into thinking this is good pizza.  You're better than this!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here around lunch time yesterday.  We live in Sun City and had never heard of Mellow Mushroom pizza until I purchased a groupon  for here.  We like to try new places in our search for really good pizza that taste good to us. After looking at the online menu & reading the mixed reviews we delayed coming here until our groupon was about to expire. The prices seemed high and we were not expecting much.  Hubby ordered small house salad and small Rib Eye Pie. I ordered a small Mega-Veggie, even though the broccoli, banana peppers & tofu sounded like strange additions on it.  We  thought that a small would be a personal size & we could each eat half of each pizza.  Wow, we were wrong!!
Our wonderful server Johnny brought out the house salad along with 2 plates so that we could split it.  We thought he made a mistake & gave us a large salad. The veges were fresh & hubby loved the Balsamic dressing!!  The pizzas were served at the right amount of time after the salad.  They were much larger than we thought they would be and they taste so good.  All the veggies blended so well together on the Mega-Veggie and their was a lot of meat on the Rib Eye Pie!! The pizza's were so filling that we could only eat 1 slice of each pizza.  We brought home more pizza than we could eat there.  Great leftovers for tonight & maybe tomorrow. 
Drink prices were very high.  $2.80 for ice tea & over $4 for a Coors light can.   We almost removed a star for that, but decided that next time we well only ask for water or go at beginning of Happy Hour.  Most important is yes, we will go back again for the wonderful food!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good and the restaurant itself is very nice. This establishment has plenty of TVs, a good draft beer selection and full bar. Aside for the conventional toppings, they offer specialty combinations. The \"baked potato\" themed pizza is topped with ranch sauce, among other things. I'm a purist so I got half with pepperoni only. The pepperoni half was above average, in my opinion. 

All in all, this is an awesome place to grab some drinks, watch a game and eat some pizza."}
{"text":"Love the grateful dead drink, but it always has been inconsistent when it is made. You can tell right away by the color if it is going to be strong or not. I guess it depends who makes it. I always come here and yesterday I decided to add artichoke to my pizza, for as much as I paid for it I was expecting a good portion, but there was barely any artichoke and it was really disappointing and to the point where I almost wanted to ask for a refund of just the price of the artichoke. It either looked like they didn't have it in the kitchen and were really low, or maybe they just do small portions of it, but either way it wasn't worth the $2+ i paid extra for it. Now I know not to add it. Friendly staff every time I've come but it seems like we are always waiting the longest on our check being brought over. Mixed feelings!"}
{"text":"Matthew the bartender was awesome! He knew exactly how to dial my taste in for every beer that I asked for! Smiles and all ask for Matthew and he'll do you well!!"}
{"text":"Delicious quality pizza for a sit-down night out or with a group!

Tried this place for the first time in January of 2016 with some friends & had a blast. Great beer selection, cool interior decor that lives up to the theme, and awesome fire oven pizza! Until last month I hadn't been since, so I wasn't sure if my memory was deceiving me about how good it was, but it exceeded my expectations for a 2nd time. 

The pizzas are a very nice size (I've gone home with leftovers both times). The Loaded Potato Pie is very heavy, but out of this world. We also did a simple \"build your own\" with pep, cheese, basil, & great ground sausage as well, along with a fresh & light caprese salad. Combine that with your favorite brew and that's a great night. 

Need to check this place out in the summer too because they pop open garage doors by the bar for a cool-looking open atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, but I can't. The food is outstanding and that's what keeps us coming back. 
Unfortunately every time we have been here the service has been subpar. The servers always seem so frantic trying to rush around the restaurant and take care of everyone. It takes forever to get your drinks and food (even though the wait is worth it). We have found it more convenient to get take out or delivery from this place. Then we get the great food without the bad service."}
{"text":"I've only eaten the pizza here... Which was good. But the service is incredibly slow. It's been practically empty when I've been. Pizza takes 30 minutes. The Next Time I decided to call first and pick up, they told me 15 minutes.... 35 minutes later I still have not gotten my regular pizza. There are five customers here. Incredibly Slow kitchen so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is a neat idea.  The restaurants always have cool themes and a fun environment.  I have only eaten at the bar here and it's always been ok.  The bar space is large and roomy.  There are cool lava lamps set up to look at and huge tvs.

The customer service sucks.  The bartenders I have had are always rude.  The food orders take a long time.  They seem unapologetic about it.

The food is pretty good, never a complaint.  I like the pizza and calzones (light ricotta) are decent."}
{"text":"I have been here for happy hour three or four times. They have a very broad beer selection and all the appetizers are discounted at happy hour"}
{"text":"Service is decent. But I waited over an hour for a small pizza. Under staffed. No music. No sound on TVs. Nobody seems to know what's going on. There is a lot of pizza places in uptown Charlotte, this should be last on your list!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was okay when we FINALLY got it after a hour of waiting. The place was fairly empty so for 2 pizzas it was a crazy wait. The server was nice and made sure our drinks stayed full, but I don't think I would go back again."}
{"text":"We have given this place their last chance. Service is always slow and EVERY time our order has been wrong. Today, we had a receipt under our pizza! They did make us a new one however we still had to pay for it. Trust me and go to the Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn.  The service is great, atmosphere is great and food is great! Don't waste your time with this location."}
{"text":"I just ordered a large vegan pizza through postdates for $40 total. That is expensive as it is, but the pizza was soooo gross. The crust is a redeeming quality, but the pizza arrived cold, very mushy, absolutely terrible. I will never order from here again, such regret, $40 for a bad pizza!!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, food is very enjoyable, great selection of beers on tap and in bottle.  However, I went lastnight and asked for a table outside, and the hostess said there was a 45 minute wait.  I went outside and counted 17 open tables.  I went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with the pizza here. We had the the delicious meat lovers pizza and a Caesar salad. Food came out in a timely manner and our server Trisha was the nicest person we have met here so far. There beer selection is also a plus. Our waitress mentioned we should come back for happy hour so we will have to check it out."}
{"text":"Magic Kingdom meets Motor Speedway meets Hippies, Beer, and Pizza.

The most diverse selection of veg protein toppings in CLT - BBQ tofu (hm!), jerk tofu (HMM!) and tempeh (*GASP*) are the choices aside from pesto tofu (eh). Pizzas are greeeeeeasy, salty, and satisfying, and extremely unhealthy. I know it's pizza. But still, good GOD with the grease. Did that stop me from eating slice 2? Nossir.

The bright lights in your face, no garlic on the table, and unabsorbent logo-bedecked recycley napkins will remind you where you are (a chain) and what the original once was (VW van booths, well built specialty pies, regional beer selection). A good place to eat in if you're a breeder. Might be better off with take-out if not."}
{"text":"First timer eating here last night. It was pretty busy being Saturday and after an ASU game. Atmosphere was pretty cool though, liked the decor with graffiti and skateboards, that was pretty neat. Surprisingly we were able to get seated pretty quickly and our order was taken shortly after. I had the Kosmic Karma with pepperoni...(love me some pesto) and a Blackberry and pear cider. Cider was really good I had two of them lol and the pizza was a decent size, enough for two people. Waitress was really nice and sweet, made sure to check on us despite being super busy, smiled and was polite. I will be returning for sure, probably on a night where its less busy."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch at the Mellow Mushroom on Mill Ave.  Got there around 11:45, and we were the first there for lunch.  Ordered small spinach salad, which was very interesting w candied pecans, fresh spinach, feta, apples - very good, except the dressing tasted old. My friend ordered the gluten free pizza which was ok,nothing special, crust was chewy. Took over an hour to be served! Waiter was quite nice and kept apologizing - almost felt sorry for him.  Thought  the meal was only ok, and quite expensive."}
{"text":"Went to here on a Sunday evening. Our server Emily was great. The food was pretty good. However, saw the general manager goofing off at the kitchen showing pics to the kitchen staff. The food took a while to come out and I feel that probably had something to do with it. I would good back but only because the server was so nice."}
{"text":"Well the pizza is very good here. Their crust is probably the best feature. It's a very soft and crispy wheat crust. The decor is also very interesting, playing into the psychedelic themes. 

The one issue they have, which has been talked about a lot in these reviews, is their service. You will wait 35-40 minutes for your pizza. It is very possible your server won't be that great. I really wish they would become more efficient in this area because this would turn into a 4+ star restaurant."}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome! 1/2 off appetizers and most drinks after 10pm! Great atmosphere! A great hangout spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and dog friendly restaurant. We like the patio area which is shaded and perfect place to bring your dog."}
{"text":"Bleh! Bad customer service! I thought what I did was put my name down for three people outside, waited for 10 minutes without being acknowledged (even though I was sitting right next to the desk and no one else was in the waiting area) and finally got up to ask if they had my name down. They didn't. I repeated that I needed a table for 3 outside, which apparently was now not available because they were seating a party of 14. There were still plenty of other tables we could have had once folks were done and I would have been fine with waiting because I was very early for a meeting anyways, but they didn't even offer to take my name. I told the host inside was too loud and he basically shrugged his shoulders at me. If customer service was this bad from the get, I can't imagine being an actual paying customer. No thanks!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give one but the food wasn't bad, it was grossly overpriced though. 
The music was way too loud for 10:30 on a Sunday morning and it wasn't even good music. It sounded like a \"worst of the 90s\" playlist, chumbawumba would have been better. 
We didn't get our choice of chips. Apparently they ran out of the other flavors of prebagged kettle chips first thing in the morning and didn't want to run across the street to CVS to grab some. 
I was going to try one dish but I noticed the menus bragged about the sausage being grilled in pabst blue ribbon, why brag about that? It's not even good beer."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is one of those restaurants that I expect to find in the Bay Area. Seriously, there are pictures of mushrooms on the napkins, menu, and in the decor. And yeah, I'm not talking about any kind of mushroom, its the ones that you hide from your parents. 

But let's talk food.... YUM!!! My party of three ordered one pizza, and had 1/2 and 1/2. One side was the Mellowterranean and the other was Magical Mystery Tour. Mellowterranean earns an A- while the Magical Mystery gets a solid B. Its one of those awesome places located on Mill Ave. Its a place I would take my college buddies. =]"}
{"text":"Delicious food both times I went recently. The mega veggie pizza is amazing, as are the happy hour specials (my paradise drink was A+). Highly recommend the pretzel bites and portabello mushroom appetizers!! The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is awesome."}
{"text":"Definitely good food. Especially enjoyed the pretzel appetizer. We got the red skin potato pizza which was very tasty. Enjoyed the indoor/outdoor environment. Unfortunately, service was very slow. Very nice but very slow. We were there for about a little over an hour, sat at the bar an led ordered fairly quickly. It took about 30 minutes to get our appetizer. I'd definitely recommend going for the food and the vibe, but just be prepared to wait a bit. Only received one water refill too. They just need to figure out how to be more efficient there but otherwise, it was good!"}
{"text":"I took my family there for the first time last Wednesday evening.  Wasn't too busy.  We were told it would be a few minutes because they had to clean off a table, which I thought was unusual for it not being so busy.  We got seated, and after a little while our server showed up and he took our drink order.  He seemed very uninterested in taking our food order like he was distracted.  We didn't see him again for a half an hour.  Other staff members brought out our food and it was delicious, but our server never came by to ask about refills or anything else.  I had about 5 minutes left before I was going to ask for a manager and he miraculously pops up in time to get us some boxes and our bill.  I can't complain about the food, but the service was the worst.  The prices were a little higher, so I would expect better service.  I get better service every time I go to a Denny's.   We have no interest in going here again."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals. Sat on the patio every time I have been there and the service tends to be a little slower out there, but the servers were always nice and fairly attentive. (If there were a seperate rating for service, it would be 3 stars.) The food is delicious!!! Definitely try the meatball appetizer and the spinach dip. The pizza's are great as well. I tried the jerk chicken wings and was not impressed with the seasonings, but the overall flavor was ok. Tried the pretzel dessert, which by the way, is literally a large pretzel the size you would buy at a mall or sports event. The dough seems to be made in house and the pretzels rolled by hand, which is really refreshing to see in a restaurant that serves many items made with bread.

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you can go during happy hour."}
{"text":"I've heard nothing but great things about this place before going and countless friends saying how much they want to go, and indeed it serves the \"pizza fix\" quite admirably. 

As the name may suggest, the place is nothing short of making you feel like you're on an acid trip as you walk in with the entire place decked out in psychedelic decor and 60's rock playing, presumably all the time. 

Our party of 8 was seated eighth away since it was a Monday night and waiter was great in finding out if we had been there before and letting us know what they do well. The beer list was great and the prices are some of the best I've seen in Cleveland (Bell's Two Hearted for $4.75, for example). 

We had a tough time deciding what we wanted to get because we were fighting with deciding on a pie or the calzone, which looked equally as delicious, and my fianc√© and I decided to try with what they're known for in their Pizza. We got the House Special which came with just about all of the meat products and extra cheese. I think each person in our party got something different and it all looked incredible and not a complaint from anyone (but come on, it's pizza...no one complains). We decided to split a small because we had just come from a function that had some apps so we weren't terribly hungry and the small was plenty of pie! Even if we hadn't eaten prior the small pie to split is a great option if you don't want to stuff your face and go into pizza coma, but if that is your objective definitely go with a medium or larger. 

The only reason this place doesn't get a 5th star is because I feel pizza is something you always compare to your favorite place, and mine is Mama Santa's in Little Italy which is a short walk for me on the east side and I just didn't feel that Mellow Mushroom was going to replace my go-to. But there was plenty left to be desired leaving this place because I saw about about three different pies that I want to come back and try.....and one of those calzones! And not to mention I know can have a couple pints also and not go broke. So surely the next time I need my pizza and I'm on the west side, this will be very high on my go-to list. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm a frequent check in here and I usually give a four or five star rating. The food (late night appetizers) was on point as usual. After putting my order in af the bar, left card as open tab. They closed my tab no issues but couldn't find my card. The female bartender insisted she gave it back, I'm just waiting on a phone call tomorrow saying they have it which is extremely annoying. Make more effort next time in \"looking\"


Update: Picked up my card the next day."}
{"text":"Came to try the new mellow mushroom and it was not a good experience ordered the mighty meat pizza and dough was under cooked and it was so Greasy couldn't eat it waitress promised me a gift card if I would come back never got it paid for the pizza a beer and left they better pick it up or they will loose more then just me as a customer"}
{"text":"Truly the best pizza I've had in the valley! Tends to be very busy Friday and Saturday nights at dinner time, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom has a funkadelic theme and delicious unique pizzas. The only downside is that they're about 30% more expensive than most pizza places. I prefer the Kosmic Karma, which has Red sauce base with feta and mozzarella cheeses, spinach, sun- dried tomatoes and Roma tomatoes with a pesto swirl. This is one of a few options for the vegetarians out there. 

The uptown location can get busy around lunch, but the kitchen does a good job of churning out pizzas in a reasonable time.

On my last visit, I was checking in on Yelp and asked a cashier whether they delivered. It turns out that while Mellow Mushroom doesn't deliver, there is a service called QuickFox that will deliver MM pizza to you. The cashier even provided me with a magnet to help me remember. I have always experienced good service whether getting takeout, eating lunch, having dinner, or dining at the bar. It's a well run establishment and if you haven't been, make it a point to go."}
{"text":"We first tried mellow mushroom on a Groupon, and now we're regulars. The red skin potato pie is AMAZING (but make sure to ask for spicy ranch on the side if you're wimpy like me). 

We normally get take out, and they aren't always super speedy to get to the side door (might need a bell) but food is very GOOD!  We also liked their BBQ Chicken pizza and Spinach Dip. 

Today, a slow Sunday, we had a problem with our pizza being too spicy (forgot to ask for no spicy ranch). Hubby called the store after we realized our mistake, and they made it right. Customer service - heck yes! The team took care of us and were friendly and professional from start to finish.

Oh, and did you know they have gluten free crust and vegan cheese?!"}
{"text":"Came in here for dinner with family and were seated promptly.  The server took all of our orders in a timely fashion, but overall wasn't very friendly or engaging. We ordered the House Special and the Kosmic Karma, both of which were very yummy. It took over 25 minutes for our food to come out, which seemed extra long since we came in very hungry. 

The decor inside is much nicer than other Mellow Mushroom locations that I have been to, probably since it is located in Ballantyne.  Would be a good spot to have dinner with a friend and catch up since you will have time to kill waiting for food."}
{"text":"We had no wait time, just walked right in and found a booth. Our waitress came up and explained how everything worked, as far as size and types and how they can split the pizzas so you can try more than one kind. We got our pizzas fairly quickly and they were so good! We got the Maui Wowie, cheese, pepperoni and green pepper, and the supreme. The pizzas were filling but were so tasty that we didn't want to stop eating. My son, who is an extremely picky eater had two slices. We got. Groupon for $20 worth of food for $10, so I would definitely recommend buying one on your way in.  Great location, great customer service, and great food! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Amazing pizza at a great price, with a fun atmosphere. Such a unique tasting crust. I would recommend this for any fun family or friend gathering. I really liked the outdoor seating as well. Oh, and the beer cheese is definitely worth the extra charge! Yumm."}
{"text":"I'm a beer nut. I love Rogue, Stone, and any other west coast craft brews. When saw a picture in new times with a half dozen Rogue taps, I knew I had to go. We decided to wait until they had been open a few days and could get the hang of things.

So, Sunday night we drove all the way up to the north suburbs into some sterile power center with all the usual suburban crap. I was overly delighted to see pictures of downtown Phoenix all over the place. There are probably a couple dozen photoshopped shots around the restaurant. It definitely made me feel like it was at least not 100% a carbon copy chain restaurant, even though it is a chain, but it's probably franchised. 

The wings I would not order again. The quality of them seemed to be fine, and they were baked rather than deep fried, but they were so small that it made me feel a little ripped off. They were about 1/2 the size of the wings from NYPD and about 1/3 the size of Streets of New York's. I then ordered the Rogue Chocolate Stout and the girlfriend ordered a Rogue Juniper Ale, both on draft, along with just about everything else, including Chimay tripple... nice! Pizza was a Kosmik Karma, which was a vegetarian pizza and was tasty enough, but was a completely average pizza. Nothing was crispy, nothing was jumping out at me, but it was edible. I'd had much worse. 

The place is VERY chaotic. It's loud, busy, and has people running around everywhere. And, as you'd imagine on the northside, there are plenty of white trash families running around, lots of 15 year old girls in skate shoes and famous stars and stripes hoodies, and lots of lifted trucks. Be prepared to eat with a lot of douches. Service was excellent, though. I'd return if I were in the area, and while it's nice to have something to fall back on in that situation, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back since really the only draw for me are the beers."}
{"text":"This is really a fun place if you are in the Ballantyne village. Food is fresh and their pizzas are the best! Safe is not very knowledgable about their beers, unlike most Mellow Mushrooms to which I have been, but all-in-all a very consistent experience."}
{"text":"LOVE the pizza and philly cheese steak. It does get crowded but that just shows how good the food is!"}
{"text":"My son-in-law tried ordering 6 different beers on the menu and all were unavailable. This was the afternoon of New Years Eve. Two managers made excuses and blamed the problem on others. They said the menu was changing next February. He ordered a pizza that said it had extra cheese and there was barely any cheese on it. Sent it back and it came with a small amount of additional cheese. Very disappointing. Usually enjoy Mellow Mushroom but this experience was very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've finally gotten around to writing a review of this.  This is for the two times I've been to this particular restaurant, though I've been to other Mellows across the country.  To sum it up - the pizza is still just as good as it was at every other Mellow I've been to.  There's a great variety of specialty pizzas and really the dough is what you come here for.  The crust is fantastic - crunchy and dusted lightly with parm, but still soft and doughy on the inside.  This is really the huge selling point.  Price point is a little high but if you only go once every now and then you can stomach it.  Huge draft beer selection, ~$5-7/pint.  

The reason why I'm not giving this place a full 5 buckos is that the service just really isn't great at all.  Last time I went on a Wednesday night in the middle of February and the service was god awful slow.  The next time I went it was a Monday night right before ASU was back in session.  Service was again curt and slow.  I guess I shouldn't be too surprised by this considering that it IS in a college town and likely a lot of the waiters are college students and either a) don't care, or b) are weeded because they have too many tables.  That having been said, I certainly don't come here for the ambience and service, and certainly would avoid the place all together on weekends.  

Seeing as how it's on Mill Ave, your parking options are meters on the street or there is a close parking garage off Ash (Mellow does validate the ticket so it's free)."}
{"text":"Very disappointing food.  I went there with my kids and even they disliked it.  If pizza is their specialty, they need to do something different."}
{"text":"What delicious pizza! I would give it 5 stars but my waitress was pretty horrifying. Have had good experiences for the most part except once when I got awful customer service which is huge to me. However, no complaints about the food. Delicious pizza and the dessert is incredible and low priced. Definitely one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"Super consistent and creative. Service is slow but totally worth it and they're pretty upfront about waiting at least a half hour for your food. Beer selection is good and reasonably priced. Great vegan options (they have Daiya!). I appreciate the stoner decor lol. Wings, hummus, and salads are all good but obviously go for the pizza. They offer the ability to do two kinds of pizza on one tray which is fun and cool for groups."}
{"text":"Cute place. Bf wanted a sandwich and I wanted wings and something with mushroom on it. He ordered the meatball parm sandwich. Imagine a guinea ordering that in a non-Italian place?!!! Blasphemy! It wasn't bad. I ordered the stuffed mushroom on a bed of greens. It was stuffed with feta and sundries tomatoes. It was ok. The greens it was on had a balsamic vin. The Thai chili wings tho were delicious! They're baked, not fried and the blue cheese they came with was really good. I might go back, not sure."}
{"text":"I went at 6pm on a Tuesday night and the service was great. We got garlic bread which was awesome and then bbq chicken pizza which again was awesome! The drinks kept coming and the waitress got a good tip. I will be back again."}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday for a casual lunch trip and I was impressed. The server was nice, The pizza is phenomenal, but it takes way to long to get served. It took up to thirty minutes just to get a Caesar salad. Overall however, I would come here again for lunch."}
{"text":"Disappointing. That might not seem to be the case given the \"A-OK\" 3-star review, but we had Mellow Mushroom in Jacksonville Beach two summers ago and it was way better. So, we were disappointed. 

When we walked in, the place was clean and comfortable, but the host brought three of us (notice the number three [in written form]) to a table for two. This was despite several booths being open since it was early for lunch on a Saturday. My wife and I looked at each other in a puzzled manner and I asked for a booth. Request granted. 

We ordered and then waited about 20 minutes for our pizza. During that time, I visited the bathroom just to see how it looked. Clean. Check there. The service was also friendly, but obviously the food took a long time. 

As for the pizza itself (the most important factor), the dough is exceptionally good, but the sauce tastes like pizza sauce you would have if it a bowling alley birthday party. My wife agreed and added that it tastes like it comes from a jar. I know the sauce doesn't come from a jar (this is directed at management before they defend themselves), but it TASTES like it comes from a jar. 

I'll sum it up this way. I would assume this location attracts many drunks and stoners based on the location. Those people are going to leave higher reviews because drunks can't taste much and stoners think everything tastes great. Therefore, it's an ideal location. But to have this location and still only have a 3-star average is worrisome. 

We will try another Mellow Mushroom in the future for a tiebreaker, but it won't be this location."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate My Niece in law's Birthday. Had a great time. 
We ordered a few different types of pizza. They were all very tasty, everyone demolished them."}
{"text":"The pizza was good; I love the pizza crust, however the waitress, Rachel was awesome at serving up good customer service and recommending local brewery recipes on tap. For me, she recommended the Papago citrus brew and I loved it! I call that a \"great customer analysis.\" Way to go Rachel. I had a blast and I'm sure to be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza's not bad (AZ just doesn't do it for me when it comes to pizza) but the beer selection is definitely the best in the area. Be sure to thank Jenna the bar manager for that and her awesome service. She is truly the best.
Definitely a fun spot for any night out."}
{"text":"Best crust I've had in a while. As far as the pizza itself goes it's nothing to write home about but still good The extensive draft beer selection coupled with the welcoming atmosphere will make this a regular spot when me and my girlfriend move here next month"}
{"text":"Good food. Lots of beer on tap and very tasty cocktails. Prices are middle of the road."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time on Sunday at about 11 AM. As we walked in, my wife is holding a cup of coffee and I had some ice tea in the cup that I had picked up at QT if you minutes earlier. As the hostess met us at the front door she told us that she had some bad news for us. She would need to confiscate our drinks before we could be allowed to be seated. She would put them at the hostess station we could pick them up when we left.  I'm sure she was just following a policy that someone had set forth.  But it soured us on the experience before we even got to our table.  The food was pretty good, I thought the molasses sweetened crust was pretty good.  That was probably enough to dissuade me from going back.  The food wasn't so amazing that we could get the drink \"issue\" out of our heads.   By the way, we ordered water with lemon to go with our meal."}
{"text":"Pizza!! Who doesn't like pizza??  My coworkers and I probably came here a bazillion of times.  Every time we came we had an excellent experience.

The place is always kept clean and orderly, the staff here is always happy and friendly and super attentive.  The service is always reasonable, and the food is amazing!  We usually order a cheese pizza and a meatball sub to share.  Both are amazing.  And there sodas are amazing!! Taste just like everywhere else that sells them!  Their silverware is amazing!  Always clean and spotless and metal looking! Absolutely brilliant... Bathroom is always clean and well kept, props to the workers, and the tables... absolutely stunning, and the wood??  High quality, all organic wood indeed!  And the brownies.... amazing! 

Overall a great place, a fun place, a place with good food.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Finally decided to use one of the hundred coupons for this place. And I'm glad I did. Pizzas were different and delicious. I love the laid back atmosphere and the staff is GREAT!  My server, Joe, was fun and so great with my kids. I'll come back. 

On a lesser note....the hummus and a chicken salad was just so-so.  Good thing the pizza makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok service was far from ok. Prob will b my last trip, unless someone else is paying"}
{"text":"This is your typical chain pizza place only they have tons of beers to choose from. I mean a lot of beers, at least 30, and most of them are good microbrews. They also have good pizza (love the crust) and good salads. The service here was iffy, but nothing that would make me not return. This is a good, cheap place to get a nice base before going out drinking on Mill."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, food was just ok and wait staff was rather unfriendly. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place has a really good vibe and ambiance, the music is really good and caters to all age groups. It's ideal for a group of friends or family who are in the mood for good food and music you can dance too while sitting down. The pizza was really good, flaky, and full of flavor. The wings were on point, and even thought about taking an order to go. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We've been to this location twice now. The first time, they honored the face value of our expired groupons, which was much appreciated. 

That first night we went with three very active minions at dinner time. The server was friendly and funny, we had a lot of fun with him - great sense of humor. The apps, kids' meals, and pizza were all great. 

The second time, it was just the two of us for lunch. It was so sad, our waitress seemed to have a hard time keeping her shirt pulled down far enough to reach her waistband and cover her midriff and tattoo. I felt so bad for her! You know how hard it can be to find uniforms that fit - perhaps her manager can steer her toward an \"adult\" size next time they hand out shirts! 

On both visits the food was consistently high quality. I love that they have Daiya dairy and soy free cheese along with gluten free crust. It can be difficult to go out with multiple food allergies, but they were awesome!"}
{"text":"We really like Mellow Mushroom. After working around the house most of the day my partner wanted to go out for a late lunch. Lunch time at Mellow Mushroom is typically quiet and that's what we had in mind.

Today's order consisted of a large Greek Salad to share and a medium Holy Shiitake Pies. The small pie would have been big enough. After the salad, a draft beer and two slices of thin crust pizza I'm stuffed. Should have stopped at one slice of pie. 

The Geek Salad had a good variety of ingredients and was full of flavor. The Holy Shiitake pizza combined a garlic and olive oil base with a couple types of mushrooms, caramelized onions and a garlic aioli swirl...mmm. It was good. Needless to say we brought the leftovers home and now I know what I'm having for lunch tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The only down fall is don't go starving. Kinda slow to create the pizza or calzone. Huge tap beer list. On the up side the pretzels were amazing! My server was the man with the long hair. Super chill funny guy and someone I wouldn't mind drinkin beers with myself! His one lines were great. Definitely will be back and hungry for some more good pizza!"}
{"text":"Decent service, tasty wings, salads and pizzas. Pizza is fresh and crisp. Huge restaurant with a ton of seating in doors and out. This location even has a second floor. Bar is huge and has a ton of options."}
{"text":"Great service, ambience and food. Pizza was delicious. Pizza taste fresh and had a nice crisp to it. Pizookie (chocolate chunk) with vanilla bean was average. A lot of seating and excellent bar!"}
{"text":"The Short Story:
The management is unfriendly and unapologetic if their staff makes mistakes.

Jenna, the lead bartender, trains the bartenders to intentionally pour the draft beer with extra head so as to give customers less beer (I've heard this is because of a bonus system the place uses for management).  Her personality is abrasive and in general she is not pleasant to be around.  If you see she is the bartender (she is a tall woman with shortish hair and tattoos), I would suggest getting a table instead of sitting at the bar.

I used to be somewhat of a regular here, but the attitude of the staff (management and bartenders especially) is so rude and unwelcoming that I have no desire to ever go back again.  There are plenty of other businesses in the immediate area that will actually appreciate my (and your) business.

If you want pizza on Mill Ave, you're better off hitting up La Bocca (across the street) or try Slices (on 6th street). You could also go around the corner to Oregano's on University Dr."}
{"text":"The place is very nice,Good pizza! The greasiest pizza I've had without meat! I don't believe is for me"}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing!  The crust and cheese that they use here is so good.  It is a little bit pricey, but it is worth the price.  The wife and I came on a busy Saturday night and they served us pretty fast and our server was quick to give us a refill.  I would recommend the meat lovers pizza since it has all of their meats and is cheaper than getting a custom pizza with all the meats on them.  Wish we would get one in Tucson since it's probably one of the best pizza places in the Valley."}
{"text":"Poor pizza, salad and meatballs sandwich. Definitely Italy has gone downhill over the last year. Will not be returning. Major dissappointment."}
{"text":"Went during lunch and had to wait for 45 minutes for an order of chicken wings. However, the server was real nice and food was great."}
{"text":"Came here late Saturday night for the first time to get a pizza to go. Bartender was extremely rude and I had to flag down another bartender to finally put my order in. Took over 30 minutes to get my pizza when they weren't crowded and people who came after me where getting there food one by one. So long story short, the service was awful. 

Now the pizza. I got whatever they call their works and the other half was a chorizo style. I felt like the pizza is just a half step above ur average delivery pizza like papa johns. The crust was limp, sauce was too sweet, and the toppings weren't that fresh. 

If the service was even adequate I would give them 3 stars. Like I said, it's a step above delivery pizza, not bad. But with that kind of service I will never go again."}
{"text":"Been here a cpl times but only had a cpl pints first time I had the pizza .... ummm barf. I got the shitake pizza and the curry chicken one... the pizza dough is the main problem. Hardly a few mushrooms on the pizza... way over priced. Feeling totally ripped off!! on bite of each and in the trash where this pizza belongs. Only two stars for beer selection.. reminds me of a certain frozen pizza lol."}
{"text":"We ordered a chicken pizza ....it's so good like the veggies in it are like fresh and not a frozen things used in it ....
Service is good 
Best ambiance....with the music theme ....will recommend and will visit again"}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying that I might be biased because a good pizza is my favorite thing to order out, so due to that alone..I knew this place was gonna be a winner for me. I'm actually writing this review about the spinach artichoke dip, which is my favorite menu item. The pizzas take a minute to bake, so you should consider ordering something to munch on while you wait. The spinach artichoke dip comes with delicious garlic toast for dipping, and is something I crave on a regular basis. I know most restaurants offer similar appetizers, but this dip is special. Mellow Mushroom is also worth going for the atmosphere and the good beer selection."}
{"text":"Been to the Mushroom several times. They have a great happy hour during the week. The food however leaves a lot to be desired. I've tried several items, all seem to taste the same. Pretzels are totally bland, pizza, bland, meatballs like warm and bland. The food has absolutely no character what so ever. Go for the happy hour. Go elsewhere for the food. The staff are great, it's not their fault their food sucks so don't take it out on them."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Pizza is well cooked, tastes fresh.
-Decor is interesting
-Restaurant is lively.  Lots of people, fun atmosphere

Cons:
-For pizza, the wait/cooking time is very slow
-For pizza, the cost is pricey"}
{"text":"I love the Vegan Cheese option and the fact that they ask if you still want butter and Parmesan on the crust. The Follow your heart cheese is way better than Daiya, so happy they switched. Thank you for being vegan friendly and being a place I can go with friends and family where there are options for everyone."}
{"text":"The selection of beers are great just a little too expensive.  The pizza is probably as good as any other  pizzas you are likely to find around here. I go here because im tired of going to other places here locally."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the atmosphere is so unique. It's like a old movie set and they have a ton of beers, like 103 of them I think. Definitely worth a visit any time of the day."}
{"text":"I loved mellow Mushroom when I lived in Atalnta way back int he 20th century (1990s). Once I saw we had them in Phoenix, the wife and I decided to give it a whirl. It did not disappoint. The pizza was as good as I remembered and the service was fast, friendly, and efficient. Check it out!"}
{"text":"5/25/18 430-730

Environment: Busy and loud is the name of the game here. It has that pot head theme but it's not overwhelming. We only waited 10 minutes and received a booth. 

Service: the hostesses and servers dress like they're going to bed no uniforms here and that's really only mentioned because it matches their attentiveness. Received one refill the whole time we were there, no apologies or explanation, and after being seated no one took a drink order for 10 minutes. Order wasn't made as requested but since we waited 45 minutes for food we decided not to say anything. 

Food: Besides the cheese on the crust tasting like it sat out for to long the flavor of the pizza was good. $25 for a medium (6 slices) is a bit steep imo."}
{"text":"Pizza is OK. They do not allow outside beverages so do not call and ask about a corkage fee. They also do not take reservations."}
{"text":"I came here last Friday with my wife and daughter.  We  were seated quickly and greeted immediately. 

We started with a sample of beer, which was absolutely great since they have a large selection and most of which I'm unfamiliar with.  Their recommendation was perfect for what we were looking for.

We ordered wings with the sweet Thai chili sauce. The wings were flavored nicely but I felt they were rather small for what they cost under normal pricing. For happy hour pricing they were ok. I would say that a pizza place that has higher pricing should have meatier wings. The flavoring is great though. 

We then kept it simple with a medium pepperoni pizza.  That was plenty to fill us up. The flavor is great and the size is nice. The ingredients definitely tasted fresh. The gassy after effects later on are worth it though
 
Since the beers and appetizer was under happy hour pricing our total was cheaper than my last order from Papa John's so I can't complain much. If not for happy hour I would have been a bit disappointed by the small wings and cost of beer.

In the past I have ordered the house special.  It's great but you need a fork and knife to eat it since it's so heavy with toppings. It's good but I'd prefer to not need a fork and knife for pizza."}
{"text":"I wanted to really like this place and gave it two tries.  And I will probably go back.  The pizza IS good.  The dough is quite flavorful.  I had the Mega-veggie and it was indeed loaded with excellent toppings.  Not cheap, but that pizza fed me for three meals!

However, both times my order was screwed up resulting in incredible wait time and comping of my meal.  Staff was apologetic both times, but....  

As the place is new, perhaps that explains the messing up on my orders.  So I will give them another chance.

Decor is not sumptuous or warm - all concrete and steel with no padded seating.  This will be fine in the summer.  But in the winter it is uncomfortably cold in there to me.

Three strikes and they're out.  I'll be downgrading my rating after another visit if necessary."}
{"text":"First time and here and was expecting it to be really good. Waited about 45 min which was fine. No biggie. Order a cheese pizza for the kids and the steak and cheese for me. The pizza was ok. Nothing to write home about and the steak and cheese was cold with no flavor. A bit bummed about the food. Looks like we won't be back."}
{"text":"Their food is great, but until they get the staffing ish together for chefs/servers, they only get 3 stars from me.

Came here at around 12:00 on a monday which was extremely slow (There were 2 other customers there). We were seated within minutes of arrival & our server brought drinks over. The beers we ordered (5 of us) took about 10 mins or so, the food that we ordered though took up the WHOLE lunch hour! Now if it were busier I get it, but we had come here before for a work lunch for their soft opening (with a full restaurant) & had much faster service...

Now the beer cheese pretzels are a must. We also got the House Special & the Mighty Meaty, both of which were delish. I really like Mellow, I do, but please get your service up to par & then I will update my review."}
{"text":"Five stars for our truly amazing and interesting server Brian/Bryon (?) { the young man with an adorable Morton Salts tattoo inspired by Chicago} , he is hands down one of the best waiters my family & I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying! With a great sense of humor and style he really helped make the 40 plus minute wait for our food go by quickly. 

  I also have to give five stars for the tastefully haunting  freshly baked hot pretzels! The additional cheddar & beer cheese dip to accompany them is worth the hour long drive itself. The artistic & musically inspired environment also helps pass the time as you will discover some fantastic art work & furniture pieces. 
  However, as for the pizza I can only give two  stars. After waiting over 40 minutes I was anticipating something just as amazing as the pretzels were yet my niece, mom & I were very disappointed in the pizzas (cheese & idk what else). Even with 3 or 4 different cheeses you couldn't taste the mixture, every slice was just bland & boring. In fact there was so much cheese you could barley taste the sauce or enjoy the crust. I can honestly say that I have enjoyed the frozen pizzas from Aldi's & the ungodly greasy Chicago pizza from PZA better. 
  I didn't try the mushroom soup but my husband & sister raved about it & it did smell delicious. So if you're in the area it's worth trying but its not good enough to go out of your way for unless you are just getting the pretzels."}
{"text":"Strange experience for me.  Initially we did order to go food and due to others joining us for lunch and having to order from a server, we decided to stay.  Our to-go order was a small instead of the medium we had ordered, so we had to wait for a new one.  Our guests who ordered food at the table received their food a long time before we received our pizza.  Hmmmm...?  

Let's talk about our dining experience.  Our hostess, a very young girl was rude! She stared at our group the whole time and it was clear that she had some kind of issue going on.  Our manager seemed a little out of sorts but did his best to make up for the botched order (sorta).  What can I say...our waitress was awesome! She was engaging and very apologetic for the screw ups that the manager and kitchen made.  I've always enjoyed their food and the pizza was delicious...so three stars."}
{"text":"Great beer, great pizza, and great atmosphere at  the Tempe/ASU location.  One of the first pizza places we found when searching for gluten-free pizza.

Try any of the pizzas, the meatballs or salads and you won't be disappointed...check out the bar and be sure to inquire about the rotating taps to see what's on the menu.

Located on Mill Ave, on the edge of the ASU campus, this place can become quite crowded at peak times and during events held in downtown Tempe.  Indoor and patio seating is available.

Recommended"}
{"text":"Awesome experience. Our waiter, Eric, was very attentive. We had the might meaty, bruschetta, and wings the wings were just okay, but everything else was awesome!"}
{"text":"Service was decent. Server spilled drink over my food and didn't even apologize. Actual food was good. Really good menu and drink selection"}
{"text":"I love their crust! The buffalo chicken pizza was heavenly and it is good cold too. :)"}
{"text":"I come here a lot whenever I get dragged out to Mill, because it's one of the last venues that doesn't suck around Tempe. The food is just alright. It's friggin pizza. If you like pizza, you will like it. The beer is more what I come for and their selection is excellent, especially the local brews. Atmosphere, most of the time, is decent. Last time I was here, in March sometime, the service was really slow because the guy was running six tables and had been working since 9 AM. I told him I wouldn't give him a bad review because of that, because I understand. I tipped him well anyway."}
{"text":"Got the meatball sandwich and the meatballs were pretty dry and their was barely any marinara sauce, haven't had the pizza from here, but I probably wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"It's my first time here since they opened this location and I really enjoyed my visit! I got my usual, house special pie, and it was delicious as always. I was seated in a great spot ...I'm not a sports fanatic but I was able to view 4 TVs and I'm sure all of the major games were on display. Overall great, pizza and vibe. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really wish this review could be great because my wife and I love other mellow mushrooms were we have dined and very happy to have one now uptown. However, the Uptown location doesn't quite seem to be ready for prime time business.  Lack of staff but plenty of seating.  Be prepared to wait.  I can say the food was good after waiting 2 hours to get our food."}
{"text":"A family lunch on Saturday... and we had a Groupon to try this place. We had seen them in other parts of the valley and one finally popped up in our area. 

My wife and kids don't stray too far from the \"cheese and sauce\" pizzas -- the addition of pepperoni on half is a concession for one son. So, we got a medium one of those, which fed the three of them just fine. 

I wanted to try something different, so I ordered a pizza called the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR: pesto base with button and Portobello mushrooms, feta and mozzarella cheeses, spinach and jalape√±os on a pesto basted crust. This one has the \"V\" for vegetarian designation on the menu, but I added sausage since I am not, and the menu says \"awesome with sausage\" with an arrow pointing to this pizza. 

Since I was eating this one solo, I got the small. I can say that a small should be enough to feed two people --maybe not college students or high school athletes, but two normal people. Not wanting to waste food (we had a bunch of errands to run and it was HOT outside), I ate the whole thing. Then I needed a nap: Zzzzz...

The crust on the pizzas comes out very crispy on the bottom and soft on the edges. Even mine, which had a bunch of \"stuff\" on it, stayed crispy, which is pretty impressive. The flavor of the pesto and jalape√±o was unexpectedly good, and the addition of the sausage did, in fact make it better. \"Awesome?\" Maybe. 

Everything tasted fresh and our service was good, despite the place being pretty full. The restaurant was clean and I'd say we had a good experience. Soft drinks are about $3, which is a little steep, I think, but the pizzas are reasonable for \"gourmet\" pizzas from places like CPK.

The kids gave their pizza an 8/10, mostly deducting points because the bottom of the crust was a little more charred than they like. However, it must not have been too much of a problem since It did not prevent them from eating it ALL. 

Overall, I would go back. It may not be worth a long drive, but the pizza is good."}
{"text":"If you're okay with below-average pizza and absolutely terrible service than the Mellow Mushroom in Mesa is for you! We waited over an hour for our pizza, and had to remind the waitress to come back multiple times (we would have ordered more!). 

    But that isn't the worst of it, their computers kept crashing and they kept our methods of payment for nearly a half hour. We were in a rush to leave, but couldn't because the staff didn't come back and ask for cash or check, (basically holding our cards hostage to spend more time in a tacky furnished \"pizza\" dump). 

     Sure they apologized (twice, over the period of nearly 3 hours) but no meal was comped, nor discount given. Seriously the manager walked straight in, reminded us of the problem and left after waiting 15 minutes for the checks to return! I am very disappointed in my experience, please, don't come here."}
{"text":"Loved the food (had the thai pizza, so yum!), and prices during happy hour on beverages, but hated the service. My friends were there maybe 15 min ahead of us and had asked for water 3 times with out receiving any. I had to ask twice before receiving any water. I'm usually not too harsh on servers but i just started to feel rude for having to ask for things, which should not be the case. We also ordered pizzas and it really took a LONG time for the pizza to come out, not sure if it was our slow server or a busy night but either way, it took a long while."}
{"text":"I love that Mellow Mushroom has pizza options for everyone in my family! I love the healthier, ancient grains crust - vegan and gluten-free. And my dad can eat pizza because of the vegan cheese option. I ordered a veggie pizza with the gluten-free crust and vegan cheese and it tasted amazing!! My dad even raved and usually if it's not the real deal, he can tell. The salads are delicious and huge. My boyfriend loves the pretzel appetizer and how light and fluffy they are. The salads are great and a very nice size. I cannot wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"*I don't have complaints with the food.
*Wish happy hour was till 7, but it's a great happy hour till 6.
*Sometimes service is slow. 
*Best tap handle selection in the area. 
*Always clean. 
*Indoor-outdoor bar is cool."}
{"text":"Awesome draft beer options. All natural food, no deep frying is also very nice.

Food was excellent. Spinach artichoke dip and the Thai dye pizza, both outstanding. 

Service could have been better, was slow."}
{"text":"terrible mangement....good product.  Crazy thing....I sneak in for food to go!!!  Place should be mobbed with people"}
{"text":"Went for the first time the other day, during lunch time and got a Mighty Meaty pizza. Service was friendly and there wasn't a very long wait and the pizza was excellent. I think next time I'll try something a bit more basic because all the toppings kind of bury the cheese, crust and sauce flavor, but no complaints. It was also very good the next day when I heated up the leftovers in the toaster oven. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by this afternoon for an early dinner and ordered a caesar salad, meatball trio and mighty meaty pizza. Everything was brought out really quickly and was excellent. Our waitress was fast on bringing refills and we got in an out much quicker than I expected."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my friend's retirement after decades of service so our party reserved the loft. The upstairs loft seats about 20-30 people easily and had its own bar service (big plus). They catered snacks like wings, mellow balls (excellent), and other finger foods which made for a pleasant, casual atmosphere. The beer selection was expansive and had something to suit everyone's tastes.

Decorations were movie-themed and fun. Overall a very casual atmosphere. The staff were friendly and accommodating (example: they did not have a drink available upstairs so they ran downstairs to get it for me).

Parking lot is huge, so no worries there!

Definitely recommend it for a nice happy hour or group lunch/dinner!"}
{"text":"Always great service, pizza is good and atmosphere is bar like in evening but we'll worth it"}
{"text":"Except for the really sloooow service, it's a good place to get good pizza.

I had the Caesar pizza only because I wanted pizza but I wanted a salad and couldn't decide which I wanted more. Not worth the 15$ for a small that had hardly any chicken on it though.  I will remake this at home for less then half the price.  But it's now a favorite pizza combination. 

Hubby has a canzone...good as well."}
{"text":"Alright guys, this review has been a long time coming. Amazing selection of beers plus a crazy good happy hour. I typically go to the location in Happy Valley, but I'll venture to Mill Ave before heading out in a Saturday night! Reverse happy hour has saved me so much! Haha the oven baked wings are great with a cold 20oz draught! Half price on apps and alcohol is definitely a win win! Great for groups, pregame or even a casual date!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  Great atmosphere and really great food.  Lots of vegetarian options, which I really appreciate.  
I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came in tonight after a relative suggested it. I had heard that the food was good. Let me tell you that I am echoing much of what everyone on here with a critical review has to say. The food is terribly bland, I got the jerk chicken sandwich which just tasted over peppered as to mask the blandness all stuffed  in a soggy lukewarm bun, accompanied by a greasier version of lays. It seems like they are cheap since they can't even offer real fries as a a side. It's the very  it's the least they can do considering that  they are charging 11 dollars for a blandwich. It took over 20 minutes to get an appetizer salad and soup to the table. Seems rather odd since it was empty on a Saturday night which leads me to another point there was no music playing so all you could hear awkward silence followed by the occasional person speaking, I've been to funerals livelier than this place. It took at least 30 minutes to finally get our food we had to ask our waiter 3 times for ranch but he seemed distracted he said he got sidetracked, which I don't understand considering this place was super dead.The manager did come and apologize for the delay, but it's like don't be sorry, just be better. Which based on every other critical review leads me to believe this is not the case. This was my first time coming here and probably my last. So if you like being disappointed by all means come here."}
{"text":"Hunter is very knowledgeable. She made my experience at Mellow Mushroom pleasurable. Its not often you find to enjoy a brew and find a server who puts the cherry on top of the of experience. Recommend to go to Mellow and ask for Hunter. She also looks like becca from californiacation"}
{"text":"Yums! I've been here twice now and both pizza's ordered were hot & delicious. One was the large Meat pizza which fed 4 men and myself. We also had a bruchetta appetizers and drinks which held us over otherwise I don't think it would have been enough. We sat upstairs at the \"computer tablet tables\" which was entertaining! I love the vibe and decor."}
{"text":"Well, this groupon has been burning a hole in my wallet for at least a month. Having gotten hooked on gluten free pizza at Fired Pie, I ordered a gluten free VegOut Pizza. Awful, not ready for prime time, tasteless cardboard. 

Our server Jody seemed to loose interest in us once we responded that the pizza was not to our liking.

Nice decor, somewhat noisy, glad it was on a Groupon."}
{"text":"Food was ok, not what I expected. Kinda disappointed. Had the buffalo chicken pizza. It was really dry. Could have used more sauce."}
{"text":"Ordered the rib eye pie and the order came without ribeye. I called to let them know and waited on hold forever to speak w someone else then the person finally got on the phone to tell me the manager will call me back. It's been nearly two weeks and I haven't received a call back. The food was good, yes it was good without the ribeye, but it was pricey so a gift certificate or a credit would have been nice. But a call back w an apology would have been nicer. I will not be back without magnifying my pizza and immediate resolution demand if it's not right. 1 star for good food, 1 star for great location."}
{"text":"Happy hour pricing is great if you can get a seat. We are not spring chickens so the noise level is quite loud. Food is good. Beers and drinks are made well depending on the bartender. Seems like new staff is being hired regularly. I would like to say in the restaurant the wait staff is very consistent, attentive and prompt. I could use a few new menu items but I like the regular favorites. Always a noice place to enjoy a craft brew."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here I was reluctant to go to this one. I have been to 3 others and have not been disappointed. The good things about this one was our waiter and our pepperoni and sausage pizza. He kept our drinks filled and kept checking on us. Now the bad things, our hot wings were not their usual crispness and at least 4 of our wings were so tiny and almost unrecognizable as chicken wings the they should have never been put on a plate. They brought us a new batch and gave them to us for free but no visit from the manager however our waiter apologized. It took about 25 minutes for our pizza and when we did get it it wasn't that hot as if it had been sitting for 5 minutes before we got it. I wouldn't go back to this location, it doesn't do the brand justice."}
{"text":"The only reason this review is getting one star is because one of our  pizza's was good otherwise it would get a zero.  Everything else was bad! 2 of our 3 pizzas were burnt on the edges. Our wings were significantly over cooked and dry, like rubber. My friend said the shrimp po boy was not seasoned.The service was terrible, we sat, and sat and sat before any help arrived, then we only got help because I raised my hand and asked for it. Our appetizers/salad came out literally one minute before our pizza. I have been to many mellow mushrooms locally and in other states this was by far the worst experience. Also it was not crowded so no excuse for crap service or crap food. Completely unhappy and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Over-priced, oily, tasteless crap.

My rule of thumb regarding pizza places is that for the $10 Costco combo is the best dollar value, and the Nello's Combo is the best $20 large pizza you can get.  Mellow Mushroom fails across the board.

Last Monday I took a date to the one on 50th street, and ordered a large 50-50; one half being their red potato, and the other Thai-something.  The waiter informs us that as it's baked on stone it till take a bit longer than the usual pizza place.  Fine.  I'm OK with waiting a bit for good crust.  I bake my own at home and it takes all day for the dough to mature.

The delivered result was a mess.  On top of the potato half was a squirt of sour cream that was totally unappetizing.  The Thai half had a squirt of what I can only describe as being similar to that garlic-flavored sauce you get with Domino's breadsticks.  The rest of the pizza was covered with oily cheese.  I wish I could load a photo of the mess so that you could all see this creation.  My date ate one slice and I was able to choke down 2.  I had the rest packed into a box for later, thinking that maybe we were halucinating this monstrousity.  After spending the night in the fridge, I nuked up a slice, held it up and watched the oil drip off.  This thing isn't worthy of human consumption, unless you consider the county fair \"Deep Fry Fantasy\" as haute cuisine.

Finally, I think the cost of a 22 oz beer was $7.50 (honestly, I've tried to purge the memory of the visit, so I'm probably off on the cost and quantity).  Maybe at Chase field, or the U. of Phoenix Stadium, but at a neighborhood pizza joint?  The pub I usually go to has many of the same beers on tap and a 25 oz is more like $5.50.  But then again, it's not a corporation masquerading as a bunch of enterprising old hippies.

Total bill, with tip was $50+, and that included a $10 off coupon.  I'd have been better off with a $10 Costco combo and a craft beer 6-pack.  Don't worry about contacting me and a mea culpa and coupons.  I won't be darkening your doorstep again."}
{"text":"Not a fan. All pizzas on the menu are very funky. I am not sure what the hype is about this place. Peperoni is not even on the menu! Lol. PIZZA IS WAY OVER PRICED. The server reminded me of Moby and was very odd. He wasn't friendly at all and called me a \"whimp\" for wanting cheese and pepperoni pizza.. Sorry, I  must be from another planet. I'm not going to go here again. Everything is overpriced. On a thursday afternoon this place was so loud I couldnt even hear my thoughts.."}
{"text":"Visited last night for the first time. Avoided the one on Mill because it's college student central so I was glad to hear they opened one up near me in the east valley. Happy hour is absolutely amazing! My friends and I drank to our fullest and even shared an appetizer and the total bill was astonishing! I was ready to fork over at least $70 dollars but it wasn't even close to that. Bartender was great, even chose great music for that time of night. 

In regards to the poor ratings, I feel bad for newly established restaurants. It's hard work, and yes I agree everything should be ready to go once the doors are open but people should give new restaurants more than one chance. I gave them 4 stars because I haven't had their pizza yet. Hopefully I can give them a 5 once i try the pies!"}
{"text":"great pizza and beer! Beer selection is great and is always changing. Be on the look out for special tappings and tap takeovers. Food is always consistently good. I really enjoy the late night happy hour starting at 10 PM with half price drafts and slices of pizza. Great value and solid offerings."}
{"text":"Very good food and a great beer selection but it's so expensive 25 dollars for a pizza yikes...."}
{"text":"Good food! Impressed for sure! Waiter was very friendly and extremely helpful with our questions! Definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Awesome product.  Worst service I have ever seen.  Embarrassing!  Just go and witness it.  I'm 48 yrs. Old and never been on yelp here.  Love the food but WOW.  They don't get it.  Every other place on High Street gives awesome service.  Such a shame when they have good product!  Need to clean house.

I will not be going back but owner did reach out to me personally..He said he will work with his staff.  I'm no angel...I called the manager a p***y on the way out.  I'm ashamed I stupped to his level."}
{"text":"Eating here is the closest you can get to gambling in Charlotte. It will either be absolutely delicious or a giant waste of money. We lived in the apartments above Mellow for two years and ate it far more than we should have. Probably spent thousands of dollars over two years. It was so convenient. That is why they have as much business as they do, unless its a game day. I feel bad for the new manager to some extent. Mind you, there is often a new manager. Like there are ALWAYS new employees. Our last visit, post-living upstairs, we ordered salted pretzel bites to go when we were leaving a Hornets game. We got there and they were ready. Except, they were parmesan, not salted. This would have been no issue if I didn't want any, but I like the salt and don't eat the parmesan at all. They said they would get a new order \"right out\". 45 minutes later I'm standing up because I'm about to demand a refund and leave and they come running over with my new order. I was so furious, I was almost shaking. The manager asked if I'm the one that just left the bad review....yes, because you left me sitting here for 45 minutes waiting on pretzel bites so I had some free time to leave a bad review. At that point, I was so tired and annoyed, I didn't even eat any and my boyfriend who would have preferred the parmesan had he known that I wasn't going to eat any, ate a few and also became annoyed and we threw them out. When the kitchen screws up an order, let's not be on Facebook reading notifications and be out here making sure the customer is getting their order corrected quickly and before those that just walked in the door. So disappointed that some place with service this bad can do so well."}
{"text":"I love Mellow Mushroom.  I can't eat there often because I would be morbidly obese, but there is nothing like the Buffalo Chicken pizza there.  I've never had an issue with their service - it has always been good."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch several times and I have to say I would recommend you come for lunch and get the Mushroom Club.  Its consistently good and tasty at a great price (the lunch special).  Just walk back to the bar area.  If you show up because of me stick to this menu item!  I'm NOT a fan of their pizza (which I had at another location - so I'm not too interested in trying it again here at this time)."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the Mushroom club sandwhich at another location and I wanted to give the pizza a try!  We got the House Special - and there wasn't anything special about it for me - NOT something I would give another chance - Sorry MM.  Also the crust is very doughy - which doesn't work for me (and I've seen reviews stating that's how they got it too) - if your not ok with that don't order the pizza.   I do see other reviews raving about the pizza - so there might be one that I'd like.  I know Its RARE for anyplace to have a menu lineup that everyone likes.  The server was akward and the interior just doesn't vibe with me.  They have got to replace or get rid of that Mellow Mushroom mascot that stands well over 6ft inside the entry - its hideous - especially waiting by it.  The lighting and musical instruments almost works for me and reminds me a bit of the Cirque LOVE (Beatles) - so that was kind of interesting when it worked...  I keep it A-OK for the sandwhich I've enjoyed N/W in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that a Mellow Mushroom was opening in Rocky River since I have visited their locations in the south (Charlotte area) and enjoyed myself at them. I decided to travel up there last night for a late dinner (Saturday 8pm) with my lady and her friend. The parking in the back of the restaurant had available parking but during the day from past experiences it may be difficult to find a spot. 

Now to the restaurant itself...the decor of the restaurant has a cool vibe with vibrant, colorful pictures all over the walls. There are pirate decorations (JACK SPARROW!) and a cool table lined with guitar picks. Definitely a nice to look at and clean restaurant. We sat down immediately and was greeted by our server shortly after. We did have a great waitress, she was attentive, got our refills, and had our food out in exceptional time. She was soft spoken though, which made it hard to hear as the restaurant itself is very loud and we were right next to the bar. 

We all split the FULL order pretzel appetizer (one parmesan cheese flavored & the other just butter & kosher salt). These didn't taste bad by any means but they were definitely undercooked. I much of rather have gotten a mall pretzel instead. 

My girlfriend and I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza (which is one of our favorite types of pizza). This pizza comes with a buffalo sauce topped with bacon, chicken, caramelized onions and blue cheese. First the GOOD: the crust was great, soft, chewy and had a nice layer of parmesan cheese. Next the BAD: everything else on the pizza. The chicken was next to nothing, the bacon was on there but maybe like 3 regular slices in all (each slice did not have bacon on it), the caramelized onions were not spread out on the pizza but rather in lumps all around and lastly it was drenched in blue cheese sauce. The menu states its served with blue cheese or ranch, which I assumed would come on the side but it was all over the pizza. GROSS. We only were able to eat a piece and a half before saying that it was enough. 

Our friend ordered the Mushroom Club hoagie, which came with turkey, ham, onions, mushrooms and cheese. It really just looked like a bunch of bread to me. She said it was just ok.

Needless to say, the pizza was pretty terrible and expensive. I have no problem paying for quality but for a 6 slice pizza to be that poorly made for 22 dollars basically tells me to not come back. I will say that we DID have very adequate service and hats off to our server BUT the food is just not up to par to make me come back. We'll stick with Romeo's Pizza takeout instead which is a lot cheaper and a lot tastier. Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and service ! And its open later then most restaurants nearby. They serve food till 1am."}
{"text":"We came to this establishment when it first opened. Loved it so much at my husbands request for a early Fathers Day gift we went here to enjoy dinner with my family. The food was good however, the service was terrible.  When you spend that much money on gourmet pizza you expect customer service, since my family of five is so large it usually is the expectation that we spend a large amount on eating out it is a treat for my family and they look forward all week for our weekly outings of good food and a great experience. This did not happen on this particular evening, very disappointed that our service was terrible and The Who seemed to be the manager on duty walked around checking on tables never once came to ours. Perhaps then she would have noticed the pile of dirty dishes and upset customers if she had! We will never return to this place since our expectations are higher than this place can deliver we expect clean plates our table cleared and refills pretty standard in the restaurant environment but most of all we expect not to be ignored and make felt like we didn't matter."}
{"text":"My SO and I chose this place as they currently have a Groupon going and wanted to give them a shot for some delicious pizza. Dutch, our server made our first time here spectacular, he was so friendly and accommodating, he also really knew his stuff!!! The restaurant itself is awesome visually I would have never thought it looked like this from the outside! It has really cool pizza themed statues and movie posters and seems like a great place for bigger gatherings. The food was great and the medium pizza easily fed the two of us. I will definitely be coming back and appreciate the fantastic service!"}
{"text":"$5.99 lunch special!  Our experience was kinda weird, because Hubby's sandwich came out before our pretzel appetizers, which came out before my sandwich.  But, in her defense, our poor waitress was also the bartender and to-go gal and phone answerer.  She was running ragged, so I cannot fault her for the order in which we received our food.  My Italian sub was DELICIOUS, as was Hubby's meatball sub.  The pretzels, garlic parmesan, were not really pretzels; really pizza dough shaped into pretzels, but they tasted good with the marinara dipping sauce.  To her credit, our waitress kept our drinks full, and she processed our check/payment quickly (and she was chirpy and smiley, so good for her!)."}
{"text":"Went here on a hot n sunny late afternoon and we were glad to find the happy hour on. Half off munchies and alcohol! N mind you the munchies come in pretty good quantity. The server was super nice and she suggested pretzels with beer cheese sauce(yum!) and spinach artichoke dip. We loved both. the honey cinnamon pretzel is the best! Small plate of pretzels was three big pretzels for 2.50 $ in happy hr. I m going back again, this time maybe be for reverse happy hour."}
{"text":"We live in a top secret location in North Scottsdale. It is so new it doesn't show up on Google or Garmon.  We ordered a pizza for delivery and in spite of clear directions the first driver got lost. The staff called us several times and then the manager called and sent a new driver with a fresh pizza, who managed to find us.  When the dust settled, the pie was about 15 minutes late and they compted it. 
      I couldn't be more impressed with the service.   And the pizza was wonderful. We are big fans of the High Street location."}
{"text":"I like their pizzas. They've got cool unique combos (the loaded baked potato pie is awesome). It's a little pricey.. 15 bucks for a small pizza that looks more fit for a single person is a bit much in my opinion, but they are good. Also wouldn't venture into anything else besides the za on the menu.. the apps I've had are all mediocre. The wait usually takes a bit but I don't fault them for that, just be aware you won't be getting a quick lunch or dinner. But hey, the baked potato pie is still worth it."}
{"text":"This was My daughter and I first vist to Mellow Mushroom in Ahwatukee.  We've heard good things about them so we decided to try them out.  Upon walking into the restaurant, we see a greeter's stand, but no greeter.  \"So what, we'll pass on that.\"  Then we step forward and look to the left, which was a bar and then to the right, which seemed to be where they prepare the entrees.  We go to the bar and a young woman by the name of Stephanie was there but we were never acknowledged.  So, I saw a woman at a computer screen by the kitchen and I think, \"Oh, this must be one of those new fangled places where you have to type in your order.  As I headed towards the screen, a young man stopped me and asked, \"could he help us?\"  My daughter said, \"yes, this is our first time here and we'd like to order a pizza.\"  He said, \"ok, right this way.\"  and lead us to the bar where the young woman Stephanie was busy talking to what seemed to be a co-worker.  Maybe not.  She comes down, she gives says, \"What can I do for you girls?\"  That was mistake number 2.  I've already let the fact that we were not acknowledged go,  I'm sure being called a girl to most is flattering, but when I'm old enough to be your mother, it's not.  I did correct her and say \"ladies.\"   Don't judge, today I chose to be petty.  My 30 year old daughter didn't want me to choose that direction.  She's from a different era than I.  She said she will handle it with corporate.  \"What ever!\"  So, to make a long story short (lol) The service was an absolute terrible!  But the pizza was good.  Would have been better if I didn't taste resentment (angry face)."}
{"text":"Cute decor.  Unique pizza choices.  Will go back again to try more things.   Excellent root beer on tap!"}
{"text":"First timing stopping in last night...nice environment..we liked the open kitchen ..my kids enjoyed watching the guys flip the pizza dough. Waitress was friendly and very helpful. We order two larges and some garlic beard. Everything was really tasty and good. My kids we happy which sometimes they can be picky about pizza. Prices were a little high but we will return someday for sure."}
{"text":"I always order the same thing, holy shiitake pizza, and it is excellent.  The pizza dough is very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly staff- great food and definitely get the pretzels with beer cheese oh my heavens"}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 4 times and the service is a hit-or-miss. It either is mediocre or pretty good. It seems to depend on your server. Fortunately, the wait time for a table is short and the pizzas I've tried are pretty good. The Holy Shiitake Pie is a favorite for any mushroom lover. I wouldn't recommend the Kosmic Karma though. Even though I don't know what to expect regarding service, I keep coming back for the pizza!"}
{"text":"I was in the area after the Saturday farmers market. My kids were asking for pizza. I saw this place didn't rate well but I figured how bad can pizza be? Honestly the food here is mediocre at best. The salad dressings are not made from scratch. The pizza was doughy. The food seems to lack soul or individuality. It's like cafeteria food. It's sad that most of the restaurants in the area are pretty crappy. So much potential for such a pretty street."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom - WOW

As you may tell from recent reviews, I have been on a Pizza crusade. Well, I took a friend to Mellow Mushroom today and the pizza rocked.

We shared the Thai Die Pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome. The crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when I bit into it. I am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked.

Great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off.

I'll be heading back...soon"}
{"text":"Love this place, awesome pizza, amazing baked (not fried) wings, and one of the best happy hours around. Service is always fantastic even when busy, and food is served within a reasonable time. I have been here many times and I will definitely be back. Great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Fun and vibrant with a great atmosphere Mellow Mushroom will not disappoint. My friend and I sat at the bar to enjoy a few cocktails and munchies during happy hour. Appetizers and cocktails are half off from 3 until 6. The space became quite crowded while we were there.

One thing I cannot complain about Mellow Mushroom is the service...everyone behind the bar kept checking on us just about every minute or so, which was a bit overwhelming (again not complaining here).

The cocktails at MM are quite creative and delicious and again inexpensive....tried the Orange dream, the dragonberry mojito and the camping smores martini.

For food, we tried an artichoke dip and baked wings which were scrumptious.

All in all, a great experience with delightful service and food and a good atmosphere. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here this evening. More of a family atmosphere. Lots of families and kids there. We ordered the house special pizza. The pizza came out fairly fast. Lot of meat on it, which we enjoyed. It was somewhat soggy, which could be from so many toppings. It was definitely still good. Nothing to write home about, but good pizza. Keep in mind that I also lived in Queens, NY so nothing really compares to New York pizza. The service was great, our server was very attentive and quick. 

Worth checking out at least once. You won't be wowed, but you won't be disappointed either."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is as good as pizza gets in Charlotte.  If you're looking for unique pizzas on fluffy, gooey dough while wrapped up in an atmosphere that is \"groovy, man\" you've hit the pizza lover's jack pot.

Each Mellow Mushroom is uniquely decorated and this one is one of my favorites.  A fun atmosphere where you can eat inside an old school  bus, or sit at the bar and watch lava lamps do their thing.

The service is always on time and the food is delicious.  Only here can you get one of a kind pizzas such as the \"boozer\" which is made with beer cheese, ham, bacon and chicken.  

This visit would have received 5 stars, but we went on a Sunday night and they were out of some of the ingredients (fresh mozzarella) to make one of the apps we ordered as well as a few beer selections.

Nevertheless, what we did get was yummy!  I recommend starting off with the meatball trio and the parmesan pretzels.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for Mellow Mushroom, and I was a little disappointed. 

Service was okay - definitely not super crappy like others have mentioned. I went for a late-afternoon lunch (about 3PM on a Monday) and the place was pretty dead. That probably had something to do with it. 

I got a bowl of their mushroom soup ($3.99) that was surprisingly good! I was expecting something a little thinner since the menu mentioned a wine base, but it was very thick. Still tasty. 

I also ordered the Philosopher's Pie pizza. Pretty disappointed in that one. The steak tasted a little funky. Overall, it just wasn't quite what I had hoped for. The crust was very good - quite possibly the best part. 

All in all, gourmet prices for pizza that doesn't measure up. The soup was tasty, and I might be back for happy hour. But I wouldn't go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom just never disappoints. NEVER. 

Yes, I know it is a chain and you can find them anywhere, but it is so consistent and so good. The staff is always happy to help, and you can tell they are happy to work there. 

My new favorite is the Holy Shitake pie. Holy sh** (no pun intended) it is good. Mushrooms and truffle, and aoli what else could you want? Their crust is dense but delicious. Sprinkled with parmesan and good to the last bite. The dough is on point. We had the bruschetta this visit, and it was good as well. You can also never go wrong with Kosmic Karma or the Mighty Meaty. 

Also, they always have a great beer selection and good specials throughout the week. 

Honestly, I have had a hard time finding pizza this good in town, even at local places."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE pizza place! The potato pizza is so delicious, and I also love their garlic parmesan pretzels! This place has a great vibe and friendly staff! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For being a chain they have good food. I like them they have special artisan pizza. They do warn you that things are baked to order so it takes a while but I feel like they are extra slow when it comes to other things. Like drinks and bringing your check. I tried to go on a lunch break with my husband and had to box up my lunch cause it took a whole hour to make a calzone. That's a little extreme."}
{"text":"Ordered out again and was so disappointed. They told me it would take 30-35 minutes. In reality it took over an hour. No apologizes. By the time we got home (we live about 3 miles away) the pizza was cold. For the price and the hype I don't think it is worth it."}
{"text":"Love coming here for a late dinner/drink. Reverse happy hour starts at 10pm and their Thai wings are AMAZING! Bar staff is always great."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good, but like so many other places in Tempe, the service is fair at best.  I don't think the staff likes hearing \"I have a groupon\" from their customers, either.  Luckily they have a pickup counter if you just want a good pizza without being ignored by the not very busy looking bartenders.

3 stars seems too low because of the quality pizza, clean bar, and cold beers on tap.  4 seems too high because of the unattentive service and prices.  Settling on 4 stars because they frequently have groupons."}
{"text":"We came as a family of 8 for our first trip and we were really happy with our night! The service was great. We sat on the patio because it was so nice outside, but unfortunately they do not have any lights outside so it was pretty dark. I mean, we had to use our phone flashlights to read the menu. Anyway, we ordered the mushroom pizza, the house and the bbq. The mushroom was soooo good and different! The other two were yummy but we especially enjoyed the mushroom! Only 4 stars because they need lights on the patio and the others two pizzas were about a 7/10."}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner graduation celebration.
Service: was very good very attentive, also quick
Facility: restaurant is located near a group of restaurants
Food: we ordered pizza and it was ok
Value: A bit high, but it is justified by the location
Overall: very good experience"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE......We stopped in today at 11:15 am to have lunch.  We walked in and stood behind another couple that said they had already been waiting for a hostess to show up for over 15 minutes. Finally the hostess showed up and was only concerned about the party of 16 for the patio.....completely ignoring the rest of us. Finally another gentleman went and got the manager and when he approached the desk he had an attitude already. He told us, not asked us to be patient and that they were working on the large party. At that point I informed him that the hostess had appeared 2 times and another girl once and neither of them even acknowledged any of us. The manager again said to be patient, that they just opened and had a large party. I said, you have been open 45 minutes, this is very poor customer service. He sarcastically said again to be patient. I told him we would be leaving and going to eat somewhere else.....his reaction was to Thank me for my patience. .....
DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCATION......the one in Tempe is always awesome."}
{"text":"It was our first time at this new location.   My family just loves this place! Our pizzas wer delicious. We fot a 1/2 mega veggie and 1/2 Funky Q chicken. Although, my daughter specified no onions on her half, they did put onions. We told our AWESOME server Maverick he quickly told the kitchen and brought a small pizza that was comped, j ust for her.  She was a happy girl! Maverick did good! We then had three different managers come over to us apologizing for the mistake, and we got a card for a free appetizer for next time. The staff made us feel welcome and important. We will absolutely be returning. Thank you to Maverick for making our experience a great one. We  Mellow Mushroom! Oh and the drinks...omg outta this world!"}
{"text":"If you like a rude, lazy and unprofessional server staff and half arse  pizza dine here."}
{"text":"First time in this fabulous new restaurant and was wowed from the minute we were greeted by not one but two enthusiastic young people at the front door wearing fun and artistic Mellow Mushroom T-Shirts!  The space is so cool!!  Fantastic lighting, artwork and bright and open feeling during lunchtime.  The entire vibe is fantastic--relaxed but very individual--a great soundtrack plays in the background--not too loud to have a conversation but loud enough to hear!

The food is fantastic.  Without question, best pizza crust ever!  We had a terrific server; Kaley.  She was able to tell us some things about the interesting menu (also very creative--and love how they show the calorie counts for the dishes available!).  She suggested honey mustard to dip the pizza crust in--a huge win!  The wings are baked not fried but crispy and tender inside with all kinds of sauce options we didn't have to feel guilty in enjoying!  The Thai Dye pizza is incredibly good with a mix of flavors that simply made me smile.  My husband got the house special--loaded with traditional meats and veggies--also excellent.   Apparently they use REAL mozzarella cheese--it was clear that all the ingredients used were top quality.  We also tried a caesar salad--great dressing and delicious shards of parmesan--the perfect accompaniment. They also have a prolific beer list--I will definitely be back to try some of the interesting selections!  Happy hour pricing is best deal in town!

We ordered iced tea to drink.  Kaley realized once she set our glasses down that she should bring more ice--I am not sure I could count the times on my left hand that a server in ANY restaurant has been that observant and offered to bring ice without being asked!

The manager of the restaurant, Mark even came over to our table and spoke with us.  Hard to believe this place has only been open for 2 weeks.  The food was terrific, service fantastic and everything served quickly and HOT.  I noted other servers around us seemed cheerful and had great, fun attitudes--must be a great place to work.

So very pleasantly surprised and look forward to returning to probably the best pizza in the Phoenix area (Sorry Chris Bianco!).

Congratulations Mellow Mesa management and staff--you are exceptional!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place and I may have to visit again to give it another star. I have been here once for lunch and another time for happy hour. The prices during both of these times were very reasonable. What i was impressed with the most was the selection of beer that they have. Being here in AZ it was the first time I have seen any Rouge beer on tap. During happy hour all drinks were half off making a delicious brew of Rouge hazelnut brown an amazing $3.50. The appetizers aren't your normal fried bar food you would find most places either. Along with my friends we split the meatball appetizer, the stuffed portobello mushroom and the oven roasted wings (medium).

The meatball appetizer came on a triangle plate with a generous helping of their red sauce in the middle. The three meatballs were cut in half and placed on skewers laying lightly in the marinara sauce. The meatball was juicy and the sauce complimented it nicely. This is a true definition of an appetizer because it was just enough to start off your meal but not enough to make you full. I would take great taste over a full stomach when it comes to an appetizer any day. 

The portobello mushroom also tasted great, stuffed with cheese and spinach with a drizzle of a balsamic vinaigrette on the top of it. Once again great taste but not so filling.

The wings were excellent, with them being oven roasted the flavor of the juicy chicken and the sauce on the wings was amazing. The meat was falling off the bone. 

I have also had the pizza from here and I love the creative specialty pies that are available. The pizza we had was a \"hot potato pie\" which came with potatoes, bacon, onion and a drizzle of sour cream. There was no red sauce with this pizza. The flavor combo was interesting and good. I was looking forward to eating the crust the most, it was delicious. 

My recommendation is to try this place for happy hour and try a couple of appetizers off the menu with a tasty craft beer.

Quick Note: I have always wanted to come in on a Wednesday for \"WTF?? Wednesdays\" where for $3 I believe you get a mystery beer in a brown paper bag haha."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience! I hosted my sons rehearsal dinner here for 50 guests. The service was exceptional from the communication with the catering specialist Danielle to the manager Anthony  making sure everything went smoothly and great service from Robert. Not to mention food was excellent! Thanks so much for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Thank you Keith and staff for putting together such a wonderful event for our department \"Meet-n-Greet\".  The event was well-planned and the service and food were really great.  Well done!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I love testing all the beers! The best time to go is during happy hour all the apps are half off and most of the drinks are too! All the people who work there are friendly and down to earth. Even if you go and it not happy hour the food is great and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Ok so it's my 4th time and I had my 4th different pie and still I can't find one I don't think is amazing.  Today I had the Protein pie (not sure the name but something meaty).  It had pepperoni, ham, bacon, sausage, and cheese tons and tons of protein so that means it was healthy ; ).  

Mellow Mushroom hit it out the park again and I can't wait to go back for another new pie."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience while eating here.  The atmosphere is funky,  the staff is friendly,  the food is fantastic.  The gluten free pizza is some of the best I've ever had.  

During my visit last night,  my pizza accidentally went to another table.  The manager himself came over and sincerely apologized for their mistake. To make it up to me,  he gave me 2 gift certificates!  The waitress was very attentive the entire visit,  despite the fact that she was beyond busy. 

Be warned,  if you venture on a weekend night you'll probably have a bit of a wait,  but if you want delicious food cooked fresh, WAIT!  It's so yummy and so worth it!"}
{"text":"They have the best vegan/gluten free pizzas I've ever had. They're loaded with vegan cheese which I totally love.

Recently, I ordered a pizza that I felt wasn't quite as good as the other ones I had ordered, not as much cheese or toppings.  I called to explain the situation, and the manager offered kind condolences, and asked how he could best help make the situation right. I really appreciated that kind, on-point customer service. He gave me a full refund, and I will totally come back next time I was craving a pizza!"}
{"text":"After my initial review, Jay, the owner, reached out and suggested I try the larger pizza which is a bit different than the lunch pizza. A couple of us went in today for lunch, and not only did Sean, the manager, take care of our whole meal for us, the larger pizza was great. Such good crust. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I love Mellow Mushroom, and this location is no different. Surprisingly, we had never been to this location, and you have to try the unique pies at every location. So! I chose the Spin Trippin' and added Italian sausage to it, and didn't regret it one bit. Awesome flavors, fresh and well crafted, like you'd expect from any Mellow Mushroom. They were a bit busy and the wait was unfortunately long that night, but that I think that was pretty atypical. 

Just a side note, the interior is relatively subdued, as compared to the Selwyn location, which has a freakin' bus inside. But I like it, especially with the fire/water fountain outside and the benches. Nice."}
{"text":"Gourmet pizza in a funky environment. Split a medium Kosmic Karma pizza with a friend, who added pepperoni to her half. Otherwise it has most memorably pesto and marinara sauce, Roma tomatoes, and really good breakable feta and mozzarella cheese! It also has sundried tomatoes, but they weren't that memorable, and leafy spinach.  Pizza is expensive.. but it's gourmet.. you can tell that it's hand-crafted and made with love. 

All of their pizzas are creative with ingredient combinations. Next time I return, I'd like to try a calzone, salad and/or dessert."}
{"text":"Love this location - nice neighborhood & fun decor here. The food was great but the service was odd. Our server took our order, someone else brought us our pizza, and we didn't see our server for at least 20 minutes and she just handed us our check, no refills, we didn't order dessert and we had REALLY wanted to. It was a bummer and awkward. Not sure what happened as we are kind & courteous customers. :("}
{"text":"3rd trip to Mellow Mushroom with a group of 8 friends. Sat at the bar. Love the bartenders Jena, Mike and Amanda. Food was great, service was awesome. Can't wait to go again next week."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The food was bland and basically the same type of food you would expect in college at 2 am ordering from a local pizzeria. We ordered cheese bread and a pepperoni pizza. The cheese bread was a hoagie roll with cheese and something green for color on it. I had hoped the marinara sauce would provide flavor but that was basically tomato paste with a little Parmesan cheese sprinkled on it. The pizza was greasy to the point that all I tasted was the grease. My comment to all this was that someone really was not trying. I do not hold the staff there accountable. This is a franchise, so I figure that they do what all the other Mellow Mushroom restaurants do, replication. I am disappointed. I even asked the server if he had tried the cheese bread before and he said he liked it. I have to give them credit, though. I told the server that I did not want anything for disliking the cheese bread but the manager still took it off the bill. I five them kudos for the service but the price of the food is highly prohibitive when you taste the food. Added to the fact that this restaurant is in High Street (high end food is expected here) and I find I am very Mellow when it comes to even thinking about returning here or any of the franchise locations."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is a staple pizza joint. They have an amazing beer menu and the Charlotte location is in a prime spot. With a beautiful park across the road you can enjoy and mouth watering pizza with a eye opening view."}
{"text":"Great friendly service every time we come here. Awesome pizza and \"munchies\" that have been delicious every time. Just blows my mind why this place never makes me wait for a table =) but then again I often go on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"Only giving this place a 3 because of the servive...they just opened 3 days ago. Will be back because if u are a vegetarian this place is great. Had the tempeh hoagie and it was fab. The server was about as young as you could get and was  nice and attentive and trying hard but  I don't think she was ever a server before and it showed. Ordered a white wine and it took two times for a white to arrive instead of a red. Sides to the meal  were forgotten. Will be back especially after waiting for things to settle down after just opening. Only thing I think i won't like is the noise as its quite a big open space and it'd hard to hear. Big windowed styled garage doors in the front which will be great in the summer and fun atmosphere. Very kid friendly do must be tolerable of loud kids."}
{"text":"Great food- specialty pizzas & 48 draft beers! Did I mention their happy hour deals??  Half off drinks and munchies from 3-6 and reverse happy hour drinks from 10-2 Mon-Fri! The staff is friendly and the restaurant has a laid back feel. Ask for Kevin if you want great service. Each pizza is made to order on a stone and hand tossed, so prepare for a wait depending on how busy the place is- or start with a salad. I love the Dude's Chicken Salad and the Mellow Chopped salad with pepperoni!"}
{"text":"My husband & I are regulars & now our son too. The atmosphere is relaxing & fun as well as staff being super friendly. They know us well now & are always saying hello & have mini conversations with us when they have a bit to ask how we are. The food is delicious as well!! This our \" GO-TO\" place to eat & just chill!! So fun!! We love it here."}
{"text":"The pizza was awesome!!!   The first time we went at lunch time which the service was great.  At night everyone is too busy running around.  I would suggest going mid day to get the best service and the best pizza.   I don't like how the bar is step up or the lay out of the whole place but its not my business so I'll just shovel their great pizza into my face."}
{"text":"Sorry. I don't get it. Very pricey. the pizza \"dough\" is like a loaf of wheat bread. My Italian ancestors are rolling over. No, thank you.

It was clean. And the people were very nice."}
{"text":"I had read about this place before and it sounded interesting.  When my friend Kate wrote a review about it, I knew that eventually I had to check it out.  Her review of the place was that it was good albeit a bit expensive.  The manager of that particular location (not this one here), wrote her back explaining their ingredients, pricing structure etc.  I thought that was pretty cool that they would write back like that after seeing some small issues within a review.  That is a good customer service and I like to go to places that exude that.  I was at work one day and decided to place an order for pick up.  I went with a plain cheese pizza.  90% of the time, that is my order at a new joint.  If they make a good cheese pizza, the rest of their pizzas should be good too!  I drove up the 17 to pick it up.  I parked and walked in.  Here is what transpired...........

I walked into the place and was greeted by the hostess.  I told her that I had ordered a pizza and she told me that I could go to the bar and pick it up there.  I got to the bar and told the bartender that I had ordered a pizza.  He then left said bar area and went back to the front of the store where I came in at.  He picked up the pizza from there and then brought it back to the bar area.  Maybe it would be easier to just have the hostess ring everything up and handle takeout orders?  Anyways..........I paid for my pizza and took it to go.  I brought it out to my car and dug in.  Here is how it was.............

Small Cheese Pizza ($9.49)-  I opened this up and could tell by the looks of it that it would be good!  It was cut into 4 large slices.  I picked up the first slice and bit in.  It was delicious!  The crust was a thinner crust but was sturdy and held up well.  You could fold this slice in half and eat it no problem.  The sauce and cheese were great.  I learned from my friend Kate that they use 100% whole milk mozzarella and you could totally tell.  It wasn't greasy at all and it was salty and delicious.  Now on to the crust.....  They butter up their crust and then top it with sprinkled Parmesan cheese.  The crust was awesome!  Thick enough to chew but still tender at the same time.  The Parmesan cheese topping sent it over the top.  Messy on your fingers and hands, but delicious!  I woofed down those 4 slices pretty darn quick.  It was a really good pizza.

I would definitely come back.  It is not the cheapest pizza out there, but it is definitely delicious and I could see myself craving it at one point down the road.  Its only a few miles from work too, so that is good!  I was impressed."}
{"text":"Staff was nice, we had outdoor seating. Pizza was ok, but I am a spoiled NYer.  Try the extra cheese pizza."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is our favorite community hang out and local pizza joint. Living in the NW Valley, it was hard for us to escape from chain restaurants. When Mellow Mushroom opened, we were excited to try the new name to our community. Although it is technically a franchise/chain, we had never heard of it (or anything like it!). After our first trip, we were hooked. Going there frequently on Fridays, the restaurant hosts a nice crowd with a mix of families, couples, hipsters, and seniors. I am happy to see the crowed is still there nightly, because we were worried that it might close (People in the NW Valley seem to hate anything that isn't a Chili's or TGI Fridays)

Needless to say, we enjoy delving into a basket of wings, a buffalo chicken pizza, or my personal favorite, the Steak Salad. I highly recommend Mellow Mushroom to anyone who enjoys a nice variety of beer, a fun atmosphere, great customer service, and a different take on pizza-baking all-together."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The only thing that wasn't disappointing was our server and the person I went with.  (so they each got a star) We had the chopped salad. Nothing on it was chopped. Why call it a chopped salad? I have done kitchen prep before so I know that this plate was sitting with friends on a tray in the fridge until our server went to go get it. It was not fresh lettuce. It was white, hard, some brown, old pathetic lettuce. We shared a pizza which he said he would have cut into 6 pieces and it wasn't. Pizza was unremarkable. Didn't ask us if we wanted dessert. If you are a server a piece of advice is ALWAYS ASK!!! If we say yes, then that's MORE TIP FOR YOU! I went once before to the Norterra location with my husband and I love me a soft pretzel so I was looking forward to trying theirs. I'm from Philly so we are used to pretzels which are sold everywhere (on the street corners to the airport) in sets of three, in a brown paper bag. Theirs was pizza dough in the shape of a pretzel. Hmm. No. The pretzels at Brat Haus were WAAAAAAY better. I probably will not go back."}
{"text":"The best pizza! Love the selection and the prices. You can mix/match specialty flavors however you want and the crust is gluten free. The atmosphere is fun and the location is excellent. You can't visit Mill Street without getting some mellow Mushroom Pizza!"}
{"text":"Overall I had a good experience here.  I appreciate a place that offers vegetarian options since I don't eat beef, chicken, or pork.  

The tortilla soup was vegetarian, which is nice, but it was a little too spicy for me.  It seemed more like chili.  

Their bbq chicken pizza (without the chicken) was very good.  Nice bbq sauce.  I agree with other reviews that mention the crust being very big and thick, but I really like a thick edge crust sometimes, so I was fine with it.  

I had a make your own sub with tofu.  It was pretty good, but I do wish they would put more effort in to the preparation of the tofu.  It was not the firmest, and needed more time on a grill.  It was a bit mushy.  

Service was good.  I would go back again, but if you're gonna have vegetarian options......get the tofu right!"}
{"text":"Went in after hearing a pretty significant amount of hype, and we were pretty underwhelmed. Had 2 different pies, and neither was anything to call home about. Bartender was a little lackluster in her attentiveness as well. Nothing was \"bad\" per se....but call dominos and save 30 bucks ."}
{"text":"Always a favorite. They have a unique style of pizza with a thicker, chewy crust... great selection of topping and 'specialty' pizzas. Love bringing people to try who do not have a MM in their area. It does take a while for the pizza to cook... so dont come too hungry because you will be waiting! But it is definately worth it. Great drink specials and this location has a nice big patio with good people watching on a nice day."}
{"text":"The worst service ever! I was seated in the patio then told there was no one taking orders outside but I could order at the register. I went to order my food and when I went back to my table others were sitting there. I politely told them it was my table. They refused to move then the staff wanted me to move because I was outnumbered. I offered to share my table and they said no. I asked them to cancel my order and they said they would. I left. Next day the charge is still on my bank account. I have no desire to ever deal with them nor will I recommend."}
{"text":"Ok first I need to say I did take food to go... 

We used to have a Mellow Mushroom down the street when we lived in a different state... now it's 2 hours away. So usually when we're on the way home we'll stop by and pick up mellow mushroom pizza for the drive home. 

This time, we were staying in a hotel right down the street and grabbed some pizza to eat in our room. And it was just ok. It made me sad. Next time I'll have to eat in restaurant, see if that helps."}
{"text":"I have been driving past this place everyday for the past year. On Saturday night, I decided to finally go in and give it a shot. I've always enjoyed pizza and if you ask what my favorite food is, the answer is usually pizza. I rate this place a 4/5. I've enjoyed pizza from California to Massachusetts and everything in between. The crust is very interesting. I would go on a limb to say it's one of my favorites in AZ but not overall nationwide. I will definitely return and try other things on the menu. I went at 10pm and they still had happy hour, which was awesome. Give it a try, I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super dope pizza , and vegan options as well, drinks were cool to, staff was on point with the selections."}
{"text":"I know other reviews have been very hit or miss on the Uptown location, but we went last night and everything was perfect.  We got there early since it was Panthers Fan Fest and they were packed!  The hosts were very friendly and quite accurate with the wait time, roughly 1/2 hour.  We were sat a little before the 30 min mark in server Brandie's section.  What a joy she was!  Super friendly, prompt, full of good suggestions, and despite being crazy busy took really good care of us.  We ordered the hot wings, mushroom speciality pizza, and a kids pizza.  The food was really good and came out in good time.  Overall, I was very pleased with the restaurant and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Poor service 
Over-priced
Food was not so great
Was very underwhelmed. .. had hoped for better. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great food and insane beer selection. Fun little spot to post up and enjoy a few"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and Caesar salad. Crispy crust and generous toppings. Fast service and attentive. We checked in and got free salads. Free wifi."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the pizza at Mellow Mushroom is good and they have a good beer selection. However, we will not be going back any time soon because of the crappy service and terrible atmosphere. We were there Sunday evening around 5:30 and were seated right away. As we were there we saw kid after kid come in. It was like being in Chuck E. Cheese. There were even kids in the bar area. It was extremely chaotic in there. I don't know if it is always full of kids or this is just a Sunday night thing. 
Also, our service was not good. Our server scoffed because we didn't want to keep our dirty salad plates to use with the pizza. He did not check on us a single time after we got our pizza, never refilled a drink. When he brought us the check he didn't say a word. 
I'll stick with Revolution in NoDa."}
{"text":"So I drove about 50 miles to eat here. I live in Gilbert now but lived in Florida for the past 4 years and had a mellow mushroom right by my house. I've been back in AZ for a few months and was very excited to hear there was a MM in town even though it was an hour away.

The Good - Food. All of it. We brought family there for the first time and had lots of food. We had the parm & Garlic pretzels, Hummus, and meatball appetizers. All were awesome. Their hummus is probably my favorite. We also got 3 different pizzas and 2 salads and everyone was very happy.  Everything tasted just like I remembered from Florida.  Exactly what I was looking for!

The not-so-good - The decor. Hands down. Whoever designed this room must have designed it for another restaraunt. All the previous MM I have been to have had a really cool \"hippy type\" charm and were really comfortable. the decor matched the menu design and the logo. This room is cold and very modern design trying very hard to be ultra-hip.  Not what I was expecting. Very disappointing.  The beer selection here is very good but rely's heavy on the Rogue and Four Peaks breweries. Previous MM I have been to had more of a variety from many many breweries with a much larger selection.

Overall - I'll be back. The food is great and if I close my eyes I can pretend I'm sitting in a more comfortable room!"}
{"text":"Yes they are a little overpriced BUT their happy hour deals are amazing and super competitive and they have so many beers on tap that change often so for the craft beer lover it's perfect! Their spinach artichoke dip is also the best I've ever tasted which says a lot coming from the typical mediocre bar food you'd get at places like this. Also their Thai dye pizza is delicious as well. We go here at least once a week when we can make the happy hour :)"}
{"text":"I've been here before and it has been great but not this last time- I was with two other guests and one had 3 ants in her drink and the other had a tiny spider in her water. We informed the manager on duty and he asked if we would like to box our food up to go.... Ummm no thanks! If there is bugs in our drinks there is no way I am eating the food. This is an absolute first for me!"}
{"text":"We ate @ Mellow Mushroom for the first time last week.   We ordered the Magic Mystery Pizza.  It was excellent.  Being vegetarian, it's not often that we find that many choices, it was hard to choose!   Our waiter, Jody, was very helpful and took very good care of us.  We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is a perfect place for late night food when you're lit with friends, but I'm not sure if I would recommend it for a nice formal dinner, even if you're craving pizza. We had the \"constant karma\" pizza, with tomato and a pesto sauce. Unfortunately, the pizza was pretty soggy after the heated cheese and pesto sauce mixed, and so it was difficult to eat the pizza, even when using a fork and knife. While I do appreciate a good pizza that stays simple to tomato + basil combination, the flavors just didn't pop for me, on top of being difficult to eat.

* the caveat is I wasn't drunk when I had this, so maybe the experience is enhanced when not completely sober. But for those of you who are straight edge, Fired Pie across the street has some better customizable and fresh pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza and some super beers . Nice atmosphere  and seems quite busy. A definite must try"}
{"text":"Always good food, but this is the slowest Mellow Mushroom on the face of the earth. We came here a month ago before a Knights game and had exceedingly slow service. We thought (hoped) that was a one-off situation. We were so wrong. It took well over an hour for one pizza tonight. I don't understand how a restaurant can have such consistently slow service. Not enough staff? I don't know what the problem is but we won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"This one is long overdue. We've been to this location 3 times, well actually 4, but we didn't stay one time. We drove down to the location in Tempe.

The ambience. It's decorated with an old time movie theater vibe. Cute but really, what does it have to do with anything? This location used to be a brew pub so the bar area really is more of a major focal point than an add-on.

So as I mentioned, we've eaten here 3 times but been here 4 times and each time on a Saturday night. The first time we got here kind of late, 10ish, but we were sat in the dining room. This will make sense momentarily. The second time we came here we arrived later in the evening again. But we were sat in the dining room. The 3rd time we tried to come here we were told that the only seating was in the bar area. What? Yes. It was around the same time in the evening that we'd been here before but this time I guess they didn't want any new arrivals in the dining room so the only option was the bar. C, our 10-year-old son, was with us so the bar was not going to be an option. Just a quick note here. The restaurant is supposed to be open until 2am. That's really not true. The bar is open until 2am. The restaurant portion is only open until the manager / bartender / server of the month, whomever, decides it's not busy enough and closes that side down. Hence, our experience on our 3rd visit. Back to the funny part. So since we thought they were open until 2, K called the Tempe location to see if their dining room was still open. The person on the phone told K that indeed, the dining room was open. Now this is down on Mill Ave. near Arizona State University and I thought for sure it would be packed and just be a hassle. It wasn't. Leaving the Ahwatukee location, driving down to Mill Ave., parking and yet by the time we arrived which was 30 minutes or so later, we were sat in the dining room. Hmm. You can read that review under the Mellow Mushroom Tempe location. Our 4th visit was much earlier in the evening so there wasn't an issue.

The food. The 3 times we've eaten here the food has been decent. The pricing is on the high side in my opinion. We always get the same thing. On our first visit our server turned K onto a special beer they had, it was a sour beer. K loved it. She tried to order it the next 2 times we were here but they were out. Figures, right. Anywhoos, the \"special beer\" was $6.50. Seems a bit high for a can of beer that probably cost them $1-1.50. I had the Papago Orange Blossom ($7.50). Again, overpriced. Plus, it's a local beer that you can buy at tons of locations including Target of all places for around $7 a four pack. Charging so much for a beer that's brewed down the street is a bit much.
We ordered a couple of pies. The first was a large cheese ($16.49) with Italian Sausage ($2.89). Just under 20 bones for a large one topping pizza. Well, the price is high but the flavor was great. We all really enjoyed the pizza. The cheese was hot, the crust was tasty, slightly sweet with a yeasty hint, and the sausage was not overly fatty nor spicy and quite tasty. Winner winner pizza pie dinner. Our second pizza was a medium Cheese ($13.49) with Ham ($2.19), Caramelized Onions ($1.79) and Pineapple ($1.79). See how fast the price rises? We've gotten these 2 pizza's each time we've been here and each time they've been pretty good pies. The servers we've had on our 3 visits have been pleasant and the food good. If you don't mind sitting in the bar, don't bother looking at your watch but if you want to sit in the dining room, make sure you're there before 10pm.

Funky d√©cor. Hours at the whim of the Mgr/bartender/whomever. High prices. Good beer selection. Good Pizza. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"This is a review with a rating that is mostly based on management culture than the product which is sold here.
After C wrapped up closing night of Fiddler on the Roof Jr. we decided to stop by the newest Mellow Mushroom in Mesa. We had stopped in once before and amazingly the experiences were very similar.
On this visit our server was Gabriel. He was good and unfortunately had to be put in that oh so awkward position of \"getting the manager\" for something that had nothing to do with him. I'll get to that shortly.
The food. On this visit we started with the Spinach Dip ($3.95hh) We all enjoyed the dip. It was bubbly hot, seasoned nicely, made with saut√©ed spinach blended with nice pieces of artichoke in a melted mozzarella and parmesan cream sauce. Then they top it with parmesan cheese. Totally worth the happy hour half price app deal.
The Pizza? Not so much. Well, it's good pizza. Just not worth the price. We got a Large Cheese ($16.49) and added Shaved Parmesan ($2.89). On half we added Italian Sausage ($1.45) and on the other half we added Pineapple ($1.09), Bacon ($1.85) & Onions ($1.09). That's a total of $24.86. Kinda pricey. The Pizza though is really good. I love it. K loves it. C loves it. Winner winner expensive pizza dinner. :)
We had a couple of sodas ($2.89ea) and a Black Diamond craft 10oz ($5.50hh).
We were enjoying our Pizza talking about C's latest play. Basically having a nice evening. Then the background music became a little louder. Not enough to really bother us and it was just a tad after 10. Then I happened to hear a song I like, one that I actually have on my IPod BUT one I DON'T let my 10-year-old son listen to. Take The Power Back by Rage Against The Machine. The bottom line is the lyrics of this song are NOT appropriate for ANY restaurant. Bar, strip club, nightclub, house party sure. I sat there in amazement. Why would a family pizza joint start playing music that contains such vulgar language? Then another song came on. Funny enough, I also have this song in my playlist. My Own Worst Enemy by LIT. But again, not appropriate for a restaurants background music. (In my opinion). This is where we asked Gabriel if we could speak to the manager.
The manager arrived at our table and when I expressed my dissatisfaction with the choice of music he told us that after 10pm, the restaurant becomes a bar. The bartender then had the option of changing the music to a more \"Adult\" variety. Seriously? There were 2 other families with young children in the restaurant at the time that we could see. The bar area is not segregated from the regular dining room. The restaurant is open until 2AM. Why, at 10PM, would you think it's time to change into a bar? And why would you think that changing the music you play is going to bring in more customers? I feel like Mellow Mushroom is a restaurant with a bar inside not a bar that serves pizza. The music is just a distraction from the normal sounds of a restaurant. However, it should NEVER be offensive. The manager did tell us that if we did come back in just let the bartender know that we're there and they will not switch the music until we leave. Sure. That's a big IF!
Great Pizza. Good Service. Good Happy Hour pricing. Expensive Pizza. Becomes a Bar after 10PM? 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Our son C is an actor and he had just finished a run of a play he was in. It was Saturday night and we were looking for a place to eat but it was close to 10pm. We had visited the Ahwatukee location of Mellow Mushroom a couple times prior so we headed over hoping to grab some pizza. We arrived a little after 10. The hostess took us back but as we entered the dining / bar area she told us that she was only seating guests in the bar. The dining area was closed.
Mellow Mushroom is open until 2am. Why is the dining room being closed 4 hours before the restaurant? Plus, we have been to the Ahwatukee location twice before, at around the same time, with no problems. Since C was with us, sitting in the bar area was not an option. We opted to leave.
Once back in the car, I was trying to figure where to go to when K decided to call the Tempe location. She figured they were pretty close and maybe they kept the dining room open longer. The person K spoke with on the phone was very nice and informed K that indeed, the dining room was open and that the restaurant was open until 2am. So, we headed over.
Now parking in and around Mill Ave. can be tricky. There is parking in the Chase garage which Mellow Mushroom will validate. We were lucky enough however to find a spot almost right in front. Boooyaa.
As we entered the restaurant we were greeted by who I would call a bouncer for lack of a better term. I get it, we're in a college town but seeing the bouncer sitting on a stool by the host stand seemed a bit odd for a restaurant. A bar, sure, but Mellow Mushroom does not present itself as a bar / restaurant in my opinion but a restaurant with a bar inside. Regardless, the gentleman was very pleasant and he asked to see K's i.d. O.K., now without divulging too much info., suffice it to say that K's birthday year starts with a 6 so being asked for i.d. was a game changer for her. She was on cloud 9. Plus, the guy on the stool was very nice and was actually the first bright light since we started this odyssey.
The hostess sat us down and told us our server would be right with us. Our server came by and asked us if we'd been there before. We explained that we had been to the location in Ahwatukee a couple times and in fact had just left there because the dining room was closed. She apologized and left to fill our drink orders. When she returned to drop off our drinks and take our food order, she brought the manager with her. He asked us if there was a problem and we explained the situation we had just had with the Ahwatukee location. He said that closing the dining room was at the discretion of the manager, there was really no set time to do it and he fully understood our position with our 10-year-old son with us. He was very pleasant and very apologetic and said he was glad we gave his restaurant a try and hoped we enjoyed it. Another bright light.
K got her sour beer ($6.50) so she was even happier. C & I both just had water. We ordered one large pizza for the 3 of us. I knew this would be plenty. We ordered a large cheese with Italian sausage ($19.38). The pizza arrived and it was bubbly hot with a lot of sausage on it. The crust was nicely browned and not burnt. The crust has a slightly sweet yeasty taste which I like. The sausage was not super spicy hot and works for me. I like Mellow Mushroom pizza. Heck, if we didn't like it we wouldn't go back. Winner winner pizza dinner.
Our server was also very pleasant. The whole experience at this location was by far the best of the now 3 times we've been to a Mellow Mushroom. Kudos to the manager whom we spoke with, the server who was very sweet and of course the bouncer (sorry) who actually was a very charming man.
Great staff. Very good pizza. Prices a bit high. Clean facility. 4.5 Stars."}
{"text":"I went here with the Vegetarian and Vegan Social Group.  There was supposed to be eight of us, but only five showed.  They gave us a smaller table without any negative attitude.
I ordered a small Magical Mystery Tour pizza.  It had a pesto base, cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and, most delightfully for me, jalape√±o peppers!  It was a good pizza.
But, I will tell you the real reason that I am giving Mellow Mushroom five stars.  Number one:  the waiter.  Do you know how hard it is to serve vegans and vegetarians?  We made Meg Ryan's ordering in When Harry Met Sally look like a piece of cake.  \"Can you give me a raw crust?\"  \"Do you have soy free tofu?\"  Ok. I am exaggerating a bit.  But, these folks really did place some detailed orders.  This sweet, patient man actually went back over everyone's order, delivered our pizzas to us and made no mistakes.  Plus, he was pleasant (although I am sure it made for an interesting story to tell his friends).
The second reason that Mellow is getting five stars is because of the valet parking staff.  And, I know that they help the whole shopping center, but still.  Nobody called me ma'am, and they were flirty-appreciative with me (in an appropriate way).  They were fast, efficient, and friendly with the taking and delivery of my car.  Refreshing!
I want to go back.  Give me the same waiter.  And valet parking please!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time on Monday and I was impressed. A little pricey, but good food and good service. Plus great location for dinner and a movie! I couldn't eat more than two slices because they're big and filling. It was interesting having white sauce, but really good still. Makes good left overs as well."}
{"text":"Two stars because I really have had better.  It could have been because my boyfriend and I did not follow the golden rule...we ordered hoagies at a pizza place and that's what we get for not ordering the pizza....which is the specialty at the Mellow Mushroom.

The service was pretty good considering this place was not that busy at all on a Sunday night.  We were seated rather quickly and in a nice roomy booth at that.  Right away our server was very attentive and explained the menu.  We ordered the hoagies, which she explained would take 20 minutes to prepare and would be served hot.  20 minutes later our hoagies came out but where not hot, they were more like room temp.  

This didn't really bother me because I ordered the meatball hoagie and I didn't think it was too bad.  But my bf ordered the Italian with lots of salami and pepperoni with no melted cheese...so we asked if they could reheat it for us.  Our server did this with no hesitation and a few minutes later it was back on the table very heated up.    

The hoagies were just okay--nothing too great here.  Mine could have used a little more sauce."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have had in Phoenix by far. The pizza is easily 5-stars. The atmosphere is a 3 star however. I have been to Mellow Mushroom bakers in quite a few states... I can count 8 off this top of my head, and this one is by far the noisiest and the decor is not nearly as impressive. The best Mellow Mushroom I have been to is the one located in Wilmington, NC. That one has giant Alice in Wonderland-style amanita mushrooms that tower throughout the restaurant and live music on a very frequent basis. While the food here is excellent, the other Mellow Mushrooms I have been to are a lot more fun to be at. I almost always get delivery or pick up here due to the noise level."}
{"text":"Good food, poor service, very disappointed. I like Mellow Mushroom and have been at this location several times. Food is always on par, and until tonight, so had service.  When taking our order, our server (never gave us her name) wrote on her hand. Not exactly the best tool to use as she forgot parts of our order which never made it to the table. Had to ask several times and waited more than 15 minutes for plates and napkins. Didn't get them so I had to go up to the counter, only to see her chatting with a coworker. Our server was pretty much oblivious. I will go back to this location as the food is always great but will ask for another server next time."}
{"text":"This place is the place to go for pizza and wings! We ordered a small pepperoni pizza with hot wings. The restaurant has cool paintings inside that reminds me of EDC hahaha! The workers are friendly and the food is great. The environment Is pretty chill, we sat outside since it was packed inside. I've only been here once so I can't comment on the other food that they have. But from my experience here, I recommend trying it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Went to Mellow Mushroom on a rainy Friday night. They were able to seat us fairly quickly. Pizza and salad were both good. 

Giving only 3 stars due to the environment. Restaurant was very loud as there were not enough separators/dividers to contain the bar noise. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting, water (hopefully) on floor and an awful smell. 

Recommendation is to go to the city north location if possible."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. My service was very slow and our server was difficult t locate. I had to go to the bar to order a round of drinks because of this. I have previously had numerous wonderful experiences .....I hope this visit is the exception."}
{"text":"With so many great pizza options in Ahwatukee, and throughout the rest of the valley, it surprises me that Mellow Mushroom thrives and survives.  We did not enjoy our pizzas - they were under cooked, soggy, and the toppings were low quality.  Totally not worth the money!  Two stars for good service and a nice beer selection."}
{"text":"Why is a medium pizza with 8 slices $25?  Why oh why?  I just don't understand. 

I'm one that will spend money on good food but I have a hard time with this...

That being said...The fluffy crust and awesome toppings make for a great piece of pizza if you are in the mood to be creative.  We tried the buffalo chicken and it was pretty good.  

One of my dining diva partners that evening tried the mushroom soup and couldn't shut up about it.  I hate fungus personally so I didn't try the soup but she LOVED it.  So, I guess it is worth mentioning.

I ordered the make my own salad with pesto chicken on top and that was pretty good as well.  The chicken seemed a little undercooked and the pesto seemed runny.  The chicken didn't necessarily seem marinated in pesto, it seemed topped with pesto-like sauce.  The chicken also didn't seem grilled.  It seemed...baked...for just a few minutes...  But it was certainly edible!

It was loud, babies were crying, there was a wait by 6:30, service was just okay, nothing special.  I don't see the big hype about this place.  It is overpriced for what they offer and I can get a bangin slice of pizza down the road from Tony's for 2 bucks.  

Probably won't be a regular at Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"We loved it! Thank you very much to Steven for his outstanding service and delicious pizza recommendations. The greek salad was superb as well. Our family will definitely return again."}
{"text":"This place is so unfriendly you go there they push you for drinks,The pizzas are gross what kinda pizzas they have not my food,Plus they need to be more friendly."}
{"text":"I don't know how the mushroom isn't rated 4-5 stars by everyone.  First off, they possibly have the best happy hour deal with 1/2 price craft beers and 1/2 priced mixed drinks (including top shelf booze).  There draft beer selection is constantly rotating and I would say they have 40+ beers on tap at any one time.  The staff knows there beers.  Appetizers are really good and 1/2 price at HH too.  Their sandwiches are great.  Pizza better than 90% of the places out there.  They have great beer events every few months. And they have an outside patio that is nice to belly up to the bar at.  Bottom line, even with Growlers who opened near by, the Shroom is the place to go for great beer and good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours around. All alcohol and apps are half off, and with over 40 beers it's a great selection. A 20oz craft IPA is $3.75!!! Happy hour 3-6 during the week and 10-close. Pretty sure weekends are only 10-close. Definitely worth a stop if you're passing by and thirsty for great beers."}
{"text":"Not a bad place for lunch or happy hour!

First time here, we came for a late lunch on a Friday afternoon. To our luck we had just arrived at the beginning of happy hour (great prices). Started with the wings in the thai chili sauce and hot sauce. Though they were a little smaller than the ones over at Buffalo wild wings, they were delicious! Definitely better tasting than BWW, not super drenched in sauce but has great flavor. We preferred the thai chili flavor, sweet and spicy. We also ordered the stuffed portobello mushroom. It came on a bed of lettuce drenched in balsamic vinegarette... it was a little much. The stuffing consisted of artichokes, sundried tomatoes, feta and mozzarella. The mushroom itself was tasty but the stuffing was cold and unappetizing. We could have done without it. 
Lastly we ordered the steak calzone as a pizza. It came with mushrooms, onions and green peppers. Didn't blow us away but it was good. I liked the thick crust of the pizza, almost reminded me of honey wheat. I never eat the crusts on pizza but I ate this one! 
For drinks we got the dragonberry mojito and man was it strong! They used the berry flavored bacardi and it tasted like cough syrup. Not my favorite drink, and it was a little strong for lunch...unless you're looking to get a good buzz haha. 

Service is a little slow and inattentive, especially during happy hour. 

I think we will be back to try a few more items!"}
{"text":"I love this place's pizza, it is the best in the valley.  If I were to pin it down to one particular thing, it's the crust, I don't know how they make it, but it is always that perfect balance between soft and crunchy, without being too much of either.  While I'm not a huge fan of all of their specialty pizza's, they offer a huge ingredient selection, and as much customization as you could ask for.
While I don't drink much beer, their rotating taps are insane in the number of options, which change all the time.  One thing I like is the service, which is always on point, friendly, and fast.  Staff remember your name if you're a regular, know what to offer, and will give recommendations on drinks, food, and whether something is actually worth ordering.  Taste is a subjective thing, of course, but describe what you're looking for, and chances are they'll give it to you."}
{"text":"Love Mellow Mushroom!! I always order a calzone. They are huge! My favorite is the Maui wowie calzone (the Maui wowie is actually a pizza, but I get it as a calzone). Jerk chicken, bacon, pepperoncini.... It has a bit of a bite! It comes with pesto sauce and marinara. Yummy. This place also has a great beer menu. For an app, order the spinach dip with pita... In love with that creamy goodness!!"}
{"text":"I have been back a few more times and have always received excellent service and delicious food. Always leave happy and looking forward to going back. I am always 100% confident when recommending this to friends and family."}
{"text":"I have been to the Mellow Mushroom in Ahwatukee multiple times and always had a great experience. I was disappointed with this location, unfortunately. I ordered take out, I got hot pretzels, the Portobello mushroom appetizer and enlightened spinach salad. We waited at the bar where I had a Grateful Dead cocktail and my husband had a beer. The guy taking our food order was nice, but seemed like he was new or just didn't really know what he was doing. He came over to us at the bar and told me they didn't have the dressing I ordered, which was fine. The bartender was great, knowledgeable, friendly and made a delicious drink. She was also extremely thoughtful, offering water (I declined a second drink because I was driving) and checking on our food when we were waiting forever. Our food was obviously sitting there when they checked on it. My husband has food allergies and I was very clear when ordering the pretzels with just salt, I repeated several times \"NOT the garlic parmesan\" well, we got home and had the garlic parmesan pretzels. He couldn't even try them. He tasted the beer cheese and didn't like that. I tried both and they were not great, I definitely wouldn't order them again. I did enjoy the mushroom and appreciated that it was packaged separate from the lettuce. The salad was small, but tasty. Bottom line, I'll be back for pizza, but I'll most likely eat it there rather than take out. I doubt I'll be able to convince my husband to join me."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried out Mellow Mushroom on 2/27. We were told there would be a 25-30 minute wait and we were seated right at that time. Too many kiddos in here for my liking but not too rowdy. The decor is worth the trip, even just to see one time. The pizza was excellent, but took quite a while to reach us (around 45 minutes after we placed our order). I understand that the crust is made with molasses which infuses quite a unique taste. Our waiter was very accommodating and checked on us often without being intrusive. All in all it was enjoyable and we shall probably return."}
{"text":"Hit or miss on service at the bar.
Takes them quite a bit of time to return to you to order, even with just one other person sitting at the bar. 
For table service, They didn't have beer lists one day so we had to walk from our table to lean over the bar to see what they had on draft.... Kind of awkward.. But okay. 
Happy hour is pretty awesome though, cheap beer (great selection) and even cheaper appetizers. (How do you go wrong with half priced?) 4 dollars vs 8 dollars? I'll order two!
I really liked the bruschetta (it's a little sweet) but the by-far best thing there is the spinach artichoke dip. It's the bomb.com.
Don't know if I'd come here outside of happy hour cause the food seems a tad bit expensive, or maybe I'm just super cheap. Hahah 
Every time I come here it's super slow, which can actually be nice for a mill ave place since you can hear yourself think and it doesn't get rowdy. At least from what I experienced."}
{"text":"My family and I came here to venture out from our normal pizza parlor. I have got to say that they decorations inside are really cute and fun which gave me a great vibe of the place. It was a nice, warm afternoon so we decided to sit outside on the patio. 

Im giving this restaurant 3 stars for several different reasons. The first one being our waiter and although he seemed like a nice guy, he didn't seem too focused on working. It being our first time at this place, we had a several questions about the menu and/or entrees and he didn't really give us an answer. He seemed lost or tuned out and kind of just reply \" yeah yeah thats good\"  and not really describe what some of the pizzas were, etc. We decided to order just a regular pizza and a salad and they brought out the salad first, cool. 

We had finished our salad and was waiting for our pizza to come out. 30 minutes later we were still waiting and our waiter would either run by us or speed walk while telling us our pizza was coming soon. He wouldn't even stop or make eye contact to tell us, just speed on by. 45 minutes later our pizza still wasn't out which made us angry and hungry.  The manager did come out to tell us they had lost our ticket and were working on making another pizza. Not really the greatest thing to happen to first time customers. About 10 minutes later the pizza did come out and the manager ended up giving us a discount for all our troubles. However the pizza was not that good enough to make me want to come back. Especially because of our waiters lack of attention to our table and the kitchen being disorganized."}
{"text":"Friends have taken us to the Glendale Mellow Mushroom several times and it was always prety good pizza.  Today in Tempe we tried some other things on the menu.  The Bruschetta as well as the Portobello mushroom were pretty much drowning in oil and vinegar.  The steak and cheese calzone was ok but I was a little disappointed in the steak.  Any time we go back we'll stick to enjoying the pizza and great Brews.  I'm sure with that I'll rate them higher."}
{"text":"Okay, so this review kind of breaks my heart. I grew up in Atlanta, and I actually went to HS with the daugher of one of the first starters of this restaurant. I absoltutely. LOVE LOVEEEE Mellow Mushroom - in Atlanta.  The moment I heard there was one near my house, well of COURSE I had to go! I ve gone twice. The prices are comprable to the Atlanta prices so I knew what to expect - but in Atlanta it's so good that  you don't mind paying the high prices even thought there is A LOT of Pizza competition. I've even had it in D.C. and  Charlotte -it's pretty darn good there too. But, the owners in AZ are MISSING THE MARK.  

My Gripes

1) It just isn't good. I am not a fan of Oregano's too sweet for me. But at least at Oreganos they USE OREGANO. Sigh. Use seasoning and definately use salt. 

2)Never call that pretzel thing a prezel (parmesean and garlic). You can get the same thing -6 of them- at Little Cezars for  3.99 :(. It needs a little salt or something? And, more fizz, less pizza crust like??!? 

3) Use organic cheese. If I am spening almost 32 dollars for a large Pie (Shatakii mushroom and shrimp) .. I expect organic, not low budget.

4) Lower your prices: If you aren't going to make mouth watering; I just came out of heaven pizza, there is no way in the WORLD  I am going to spend this sort of money for a larger version of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. sIGH 

5) Never EVER order the salad. That too was almost 10 dollars. And ... not really a lot of salad. I've gotten better from the Habit. :/."}
{"text":"I would like to start with 'I LOVE the food here'.  It is one of my absolute favorite lunch spots.  

So why the two stars you ask??  Because 95% of the time our order is wrong.  When we are dining at the restaurant  it isn't that big of a deal, it is when we order to go that it is extra annoying.  The funny thing about it is that we always order a 'build your own sub'.  So it isn't like we are being super picky and changing orders around!!  It has gotten to the point where we won't order to go anymore and we are hesitant about going because it is pain to always send our orders back.  Such a shame too, because this place could be great!"}
{"text":"I have never really had a bad tasting pie at any of these \"chain\"  locations. The pizza came out nice and hot and I am truly a sucker for wheat dough. 


They have a nice selection of draft beers and a cool school bus to enjoy your pie inside of."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place, other than that drinks are super cheap during happy hour and reverse happy hours. Everything is half price! That's assuming you can get a server or bartender to serve you.

We walked in around 1am. Every single table in the bar area was dirty. All of them. So we grabbed drinks at the bar and went outside. Two more dirty tables out there. We hung out on the patio for an hour sipping our cocktails. Upon leaving an hour later, ALL the tables were still dirty! Aside from the 10 or so people a the bar, my party of four was the only group in here! Dirty tables are a sign of a lazy bartender/server. Clearly they don't want to make money and don't want anyone sitting there. 

The upside was that because it was so dead, it was a nice break from the noisy Mill crowd."}
{"text":"On Sunday afternoon we decided to check out Mellow Mushroom, hoping it wouldn't be too long of a wait, as the shopping center and other resturants looked pretty crowded.  We arrived just around 12 and were seated right away, but within 30 minutes every table was full.  And, after our experince and food I know why.  We started off enjoying the $4 bloody mary special with chicken wings, mild sauce.  The drinks were great and the wings came out piping hot and were delicious..next time I might spice it up and go a little hotter though.
After looking over the menu and having never been we decided to split a hoagie and pizza.  We chose the steak and cheese hoagie and the classic white pizza, with grilled chicken.
The white pizza was light, creamy, and ha a great crispy, but not too thin crust.  Loved it! As for the hoagie, I unfortunately only got one bite but my friend loved it and ate the whole thing, plus a slice of my pizza!  Our waitress was very friendly and we were even approached by the Manager making sure everything was going well.  I definitely look forward to my next visit and want to say thanks to the staff who made our first visit very nice!"}
{"text":"My first Arizona restaurant :) my friend took me here on my first trip to Arizona. The place is really cute and I like the feel of the place. The service was also really good and our waitress was really nice and sociable. 
My friend who brought us here said she really liked this place so I was excited to try it. We got 2 pizzas, one with steak and mushrooms and one with eggs and prosciutto i believe? (I forget the exact names of them) I was really excited about the egg one but it didn't turn out as good as i thought it was going to be. It was kind of lacking in the flavor department. If there was more garlic or something it would probably be a bit better. The other pizza was alright but nothing anything too spectacular. I want to come back though one day and try out the other pizzas because I feel like I would probably find other pizzas on the menu that i would love."}
{"text":"We had the pretzel appetizer and the sweet potato pizza at the bar. Different, but good. Beer selection good and I liked the design/decor. Holiday weekend on a Sunday evening and the bar was understaffed, so service was slow, but the bartender did his best considering. May check out again even though a little on the pricey side. (It was the beers)"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch recently and  regret going. I chose an outside table because the weather was pleasant enough to justify it. The waitress seemed cheerful, but inexperienced. She took a while just to get my water and when she was taking my order she got distracted by a couple of her \"friends\" who were walking past the restaurant. She called out to them and started up a conversation with me just sitting there waiting for her to take my order.

After five minutes of this nonsense, I decided I had enough. I firmly reminded her that I was a customer and since she was on the clock, I was to be her priority. Her friends walked away, giving me the evil eye. She rolled her eyes at me and proceeded to take my order. I ordered two slices of pepperoni pizza. After 40 minutes she came back with a vegetarian pizza. i calmly pointed out that she had gotten my order wrong and she disappeared for another 20 minutes. Another waitress came out and apologized for the bad service, asking me if I wanted to wait a little longer for my lunch. I said no and left the Mellow Mushroom.

No sooner had I exited the door I was practically cornered by some homeless booze hound. He wanted spare change, reasoning that since I was \"rich enough\" to eat here, I should be able to be able to spare him a little money.

The whole experience ruined any good impressions I had about Mill Avenue in general."}
{"text":"I love coming here during my lunch hour! They have the best pizza! A coworker and I have tired every pizza on the menu and just cannot decide which is our favorite! 

The only thing I think they can improve on is the wait staff. Although they are very friendly and helpful, they tend to disappear for a while after you get your first round of drinks. If they could improve this i would give them a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Wow!  We used to love this place. Tonight we waited 45 minutes for our pizza to arrive to our table. Then our waiter just disappeared . We had to find him to get our check. They still charged us for the entire meal and did nothing to reconcile the poor service.  I have no words for my level of disappointment."}
{"text":"Went to Mello Mushroom on a groupon, we liked the setting, great atmosphere, server super friendly, service was great. We had the house special pizza, it tastes great, the reason for the 3 star is our crust was over cooked and impossible to cut, saw or tear. This one thing killed the experience for us. Maybe it was a one off, but fix the crust and it would have been 4+ stars for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat it is a hippie flashback I as a former hippie loved it first of all the staff is very friendly and the waitresses are lovely the pies are quite Delicious my favorites are the house special and the mighty meat you might think them expensive at just over twenty five dollars for a large but they are massive I always get the biggest pie it will take you days to eat without help. The sandwiches which are small for my taste are yummy try the meatball and the spiked sausage they might fill you up but I am used to a fourteen inch sub so do not mind me. There is variety on their menu like hot pretzels stuffed mushrooms and bruschetta and salads there are vegan options also yuck lol please stop in and take a magical mystery tour for your palate!"}
{"text":"Great food and service!  Loved the outdoor seating area. You have to try the Kosmic Karma pizza!"}
{"text":"I had the best experience here. I actually came with 20+ people and since we didn't make a reservation, we wanted to be reasonable and split up in groups of 3 and 4. They noticed we were all kind of \"together\" and sat us all by each other without us even asking! That's amazing service, especially during a busy lunch. Our waiter was a lot of fun and the food was absolutely delicious and affordable. I got the portobello sandwich and I wouldn't have changed a thing. I got a bite of my friend's pizza (what they're known for) and that was a little slice of heaven, too.

Also, any restaurant will get 5 stars if the adorable waiter sings to me."}
{"text":"Went to Stapley Mellow Mushroom today (Sunday) around 1500 (3 pm).  Was seated right away. Ordered the pretzel bites (A+) and the shiitake mushroom pizza (A+++). My husband ordered a beer which he said \"went so amazing with the pizza\". Total awesome food. Awesome menu, with options to fit ANYBODYs needs. Super cool art all around to look at. Very cool place. 
Why wasn't it five stars? Flies. Every where. A new place with that many flies made me question if I would return for a second time, even if it was THAT good. There were easily over 20 flies that were extremely attracted to the booth next to us. We told the wait staff but they didn't seem to care. When the flies stated attacking my face when the appetizers arrived we moved. Our waiter asked why we moved and we showed him the massive amounts of flies attracted to the seat right next to us. He said that it was gross and told another gentleman but about 10 minutes later they just sat more people in those booths without cleaning anything. Oddly enough the flies still stuck to the booth backing even with people around them, so I think there had to have been something on it that they were attracted to, but it was never cleaned. 
Hopefully it was just a cleaning issue but it has made me hesitant about returning."}
{"text":"Dave's Cosmic Pizza. Very friendly vibe, energetic staff. Got me a pie and wings in 20 minutes on a busy NFL Sunday night. Love the concept, freshwater dough and preservative free toppings(I'm looking at you, Papa John). Definitely needed in that commercial district with only Danny Boy's north of the tracks and Dewey's to the east. We won't mention that dump, Pellicano's. Eagerly awaiting my next visit."}
{"text":"Service from a restaurant named \"Mellow Mushroom\" that proudly displays psychadelic art, giant colorful mushrooms, and various other stoner-culture memorabilia around the store is, as expected, horrible.  I sat at my table, menu closed, for at least 10 minutes before I got up and went to the bar to see if I could get a beer.  Lo-and-behold!  my waitress saw my move and was right over.  

After I ordered a pint of her finest, trance-inducing ale (which by the way they may have TOO many beers to choose from - I spent another couple of minutes getting the low-down on each of the local brews, which of course my waiter had a lot of \"uhhh I dunno what that one is, I can go ask\" moments) we crushed a meatball appetizer and had a large pizza with 'roni and fungus.  

I will admit - the pizza was killer.  It wasn't the ole moon dog, watered down angry-as-hell Mellow Mushroom before they left Charlotte \"forever\" pizza... it was the good ole Mellow Mushroom pizza from back in the day before all the drama - delicious.

So 4 pints (that were on special), meatball appetizer (which is like 4 average sized meatballs) a large pie with 2 toppings... ~$50+tip  REALLY?  how is that a good family night value?  Our pizza was around $25 by itself!  That's ridiculous, and I don't care how good it tasted.  Honestly, for at least $10 cheaper a meal, Hawthornes is a way better value - the only reason to choose Mellow Mushroom is because they have those sweet Dyson-style hand air-blade dryers in the bathroom.  Maybe I'll stop into Mellow Mushroom to wash my hands on my way to Hawthornes - they're just the type of thing to keep the stoner in me coming back for more."}
{"text":"I too need to reference the old one(s) because this one flat out does not measure up.  I used to frequent the one in Quail Hollow because the pizza was outstanding and the beer selection was top notch.  

The problem with this one is, that it's just not as good.  The pizza recipe has changed, I don't care what they say, it's different.  The sauce is sweeter, the crust not as delicious, and for the love of god, please turn the oven down.  Every pizza I've gotten here, and I've given it a good 4 or 5 tries, has an overcooked crust that's obviously the result of a pizza oven being too hot.

The service is exactly what you'd expect from a restaurant that has a hippy bus inside it and is named Mellow Mushroom, not good.  You might be able score some reefer here though, not sure if that's an ingredient you can put on your pizza or not... 
\"Can I get the Maui Wowie with extra Wowie on my 'za.... brah?\"

The only reason I'm cool with 2 stars is that the decor is sweet and they have those Dyson air-blade hand dryers in the bathroom - how cool are those!?!

It does sadden me that it's not better, I really want a pizza place to dethrone Hawthornes."}
{"text":"Always been a big fan of mellow - best crust on pizza i've ever had but wow the service and \"cleanness\" of the place was horrible. The entire wait staff were horrible and looked stoned. Place was gross and tables weren't cleaned up properly. Wont be coming back here"}
{"text":"I've been here many times since my first review and the service has always been great. I think the key for me is sitting in the bar area. They always take care of you there. Pizza is amazing. Excellent buttery soft crust and lots of toppings. Mighty Meaty is still my favorite. Their beer selection is hard to beat. Definitely the best in North Phoenix. I love the Purple Haze and Orange Blossom. I don't think there is another bar within a 20 mile radius that has both of these. Also, I was there last night and wanted to watch a football game and a server promptly changed it for me right away! That's how you get people to stay and come back. Three and a half stars is just wrong. Come here on a Friday night and it will be packed so obviously a lot of people like it."}
{"text":"This is an interesting Mellow Mushroom location... their lobby looks like a movie theatre... neat! Anyway, I came here with a group for lunch. They have decent lunch specials, an 8 inch pepperoni pizza for 5$... not bad. The only thing that kinda sucks about their lunch specials is that they limit the toppings you can order to the mundane options. This is fairly unfortunate because if you would like any of their interesting pizza combinations they cost at least 12-13$ (only come in the larger size). The service was fine, but the food took a long time to come out. The pizza was fine, but nothing special. I would like to come back and try their regular pizza another time."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night after finishing one of my last finals of grad school (woot!) with a big group of friends (20 ish people). We came for happy hour but missed it by like 5 minutes. We were all disappointed, but our waiter pulled some strings and gave us all happy hour pricing on one round of drinks, so that was respectable. They were accommodating for our large party, which was appreciated, but the drinks and the food was very slow to get to our table. I tried the white chocolate russian (good, but not great spin on the white russian) and the tequila sunrise (good, nice tequila to orange ratio). A friend and I split a caesar salad and a pizza with roma tomato, garlic, and pepperoni. The salad was pretty standard, nothing too special, but the pizza was really good. My main complaints with this restaurant include the high prices and the slow service BUT I would come back because the pizza was ridiculously good. 


PS Tuesdays are 1$ PBR pint days....awesome!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time ever at Mellow Mushroom, and I just wanted to say that it was amazing.i know they are known for their pizza  but I kept it safe and ordered the wings (which were delicious). I don't know if they make the ranch themselves but that was some of the best ranch I ever had. My friend had the pizza and he said it was worth everything dollar. We sat outside and the view was everything . I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I gave Mellow another shot after a credit card issue the first visit. I did not regret it one bit. Our server was very kind and energetic. The pizza is something you have to keep going back for. The atmosphere is very fun and the beer list is just a bonus! Good company, good food, and good service."}
{"text":"We ordered the pretzel bites and they are just pizza dough over cooked, but the cheese was good. 

The Pizza is creative, but the taste is not on point. 

Service is slow and not friendly. 

Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Pretty freaking tasty!

Mellow Mushroom is pizza chain more similar to Dewey's than California Pizza Kitchen.

They have quite a few unique speciality pizza's as well as the opportunity to build your own from a wide range of toppings.  Another plus is the addition of Gluten Free pizza, they also follow strict gluten free guidelines including changing gloves and aprons, separate work stations and pans as well as covers for the pizza so it never comes in contact with the pizza stone.  All of these practices are awesome for someone who is gluten intolerant.

I was most recently here on a quite Thursday evening with a friend.  We sat in the bar and received very good and attentive service.  Our waitress was friendly and honest when it came to how long the pizza's would take since we were on a tight time schedule.  We started with 'lil tossed salads which were very boring and bland, I guess I should have paid more attention to what was in the salad or lack there of.  Our pizza's came out piping hot in less than 30 minutes.  I ordered the Funky Q Chicken, tasty with large chunks of chicken, crispy bacon and sweet bbq sauce.  My friend ordered the Gluten Free Kosmic Karma, gotta love that pesto swirl.  She also mentioned that this was one of the best gluten free pizza's she has had since it tasted more like pizza and less like a flatbread/cracker.

My only negative was the price.  It got pretty pricey to each have a small pizza, side salad, and hard cider at almost $28 w/tip.

Overall, this was a solid 3 stars and I would come again if I'm in the neighborhood and check out the Magical Mystery Tour pizza next time!"}
{"text":"Yum! Had the same pizza again, it was delicious! Also had the spinach salad and it was very good as well! I really like this place!"}
{"text":"I am so incredibly disappointed and flabbergasted. We were charged $2.00 for ice! We ordered Grand old dad on the rocks and were charged $7 when the menu clearly said $5. Upon clarification we were told that's when you order the drink on the rocks. The server did not inform us of the upcharge nor was it listed anywhere on the menu. I honestly do not understand. How is this good business practice? Clearly patrons will be upset when they get their check. How sneaky !"}
{"text":"Their food is really good but when the orders always come out incorrect there's a problem.  I have gotten food here twice and although it's tasty, it's beginning to be not worth the hassle of trying to get your order correct.  My first experience I got the tofu hoagie no mushroom and it came out with tons of mushroom that I had to pick off. Okay whatever, I attributed that to my server not writing anything down and just winging it when it came to remembering the order. But the food was good none the less so I decided to get a to-go order tonight. Once again I got the tofu hoagie and chef salad because it really was good. I drive the 15 minutes to get my order and 15 home only to see they literally forgot half the ingredients of my salad( ham, cheese, sprouts, onion all missing). So I call and wanted both the salad and hoagie remade because by the time I'd get home with the remade salad, the original hoagie would be 45 minutes old and cold.  So now after about an hour of this total and getting home with my remade food, my hoagie is wrong. No teriyaki, just hastily made soggy tofu made by someone trying to rush out of there, it's kind of disgusting.  Seriously? Now I'll be returning for a 3rd trip for this single order tomorrow just to get my money back since their kitchen is closed and I apparently am not aloud to have dinner tonight. This is extremely frustrating and alot of wasted time and gas."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is become our favorite pizza spot in town. Their pizzas are perfection -- make sure you get that pesto swirl on top, it is amazing. If you aren't feeling like eating a slice, you have to try their avocado hoagie. I dream about this sandwich. It is delicious. Cheesy, fresh, zesty. As soon as I eat one, I start planning my next chance to get another. It's that good. Also, this place has my favorite beer on tap, White Rajah from Brew Kettle. All in all, it's a super cool place to hang out. Their food is great, beer is cold, and the atmosphere is laid back. Their patio is the summer is really relaxing as well. Oooo, if you get a chance try their magic mushroom soup too!"}
{"text":"Just ate here and had the house special pizza and my son had the Buffalo wing pizza and both were great! Would recommend this place for someone looking for good pizza!"}
{"text":"Never go on a Sunday, all the servers are slackers and the kitchen is slower than ever. Love the fact that the have a gluten free pizza option, but won't you put the prices on the menu? Then you get the surprise of how expensive these specialty pizzas are. I love mellow mushroom but haven't have a good experience at this location the last couple times!"}
{"text":"Just a quick review  - first time visitor today at lunch.  Service was horrible - took forever.  Appetizer of Bruschetta (which the server pronounced Brewshetta) was tasteless - toast was 'toast' actually - hard as a rock... bout broke a tooth.

The pizza (Mellowterranian) was good but not spectacular.  Again - took an act of a higher being to get our food out.

Don't know if there will be a next time -"}
{"text":"Was ok. Didn't like the food with the hype created. Have tried in other outlets and they were good. It's located in nice location but I felt they may need to improve on taste"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and we walked into the bar and sat at one of the high tops. There were two girls working with probably a half full bar top. They both looked at me as we walked in and still proceeded to not come up to us. 15 minutes of waiting, one girl is gossiping with her friend and the other one is flirting with the guys at the bar. We go up and ask for menus and she goes \"uhh... yeah are you both over 21?\" first of all why couldn't she have came over and asked us as she saw us walk in. we both are, so she gave us menus. another 15 minutes pass and they don't come over so we just leave. they looked like rude bitches. i work in the service industry so i know how it is. never had a problem with this location but those girls should probably not be bartenders. i made eye contact with one of them several times. still nothing."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom will always have a special place in my heart since my fianc√© and I had a lot of dates here in the past 4 years. We have been to all the locations in the valley and this one has a music theme. 
It is located in a shopping/living/dining area next to Desert Ridge. There is comedy club a few doors down which is cool if go to a show you can come to reverse happy hour after. They have a nice patio and a huge bar and plenty of seating in the dining area for the whole crew. 
I usually get a Groupon when we visit so I get a little bit of a discount on food and drinks. Sometimes other business give you a hard time about using Groupons but here it was a fast and easy transaction. 
I ordered the Gourmet White and a Lil salad. The salad was crisp and fresh but I had to ask for croutons -which was just enough crunch to balance out the greens. The pizza it was okay but greasy from the cheese and only a few pieces of sun dried tomatoes. It was different from other white pizzas I've had in the past and not in a good way. Don't get me wrong -pizza is a food group for me but I've have better for cheaper. I've gotten the Funky Q Chicken with Jerk Tofu substituted in the past it was always on point. I should have stayed with my go-to this trip. 
If you don't really like pizza sauce, veggies or meat then get the white pizza is just kinda too meh for me. 
I love this place despite my wrong choice of pizza."}
{"text":"First restaurant in Arizona! Great spot for a late night snack while walking through Mills. Since it was happy hour, we ordered a couple drinks, which came out to be too artificial and sweet for our table. We decided to order the chicken wings, the stuffed portebello mushroom, and the five guys pizza with five types of mushrooms.

The chicken wings were pretty standard, but a good starter snack. The portebello mushroom came out cold, and we could not enjoy it at all, so we sent it back. What a bummer. The pizza, on the other hand, made up for the appetizers. The thin crust was nice and crisp, and the toppings were fantastic. We really enjoyed the pizza and finished it within minutes. 

I would recommend sticking to the pizza and maybe skipping the appetizers if you're not that hungry. Our total came out to be around $45 which was pretty reasonable as we also got drinks."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good, very clean joint on the inside. Staff is friendly and on top of things."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress forgot to put in order, and the restaurant was completely empty. Walked out furious.  The manager did not even offer to comp the meal.  When the food finally came out, it was not what we ordered. Never again will I go back. Look at their Facebook reviews. They are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went in on Wednesday for happy hour. Stayed for a few beers and some appetizers. They have a great beer selection and the food was good. My only complaint would be that the beer is a little overpriced when not on happy hour. Happy to have them in the neighborhood and will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"WORST MELLOW MUSHROOM. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE 

I've been to this place several times and EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. they're ridiculously slow. You have to wait 10 minutes just for someone to show up in the front to seat you. Then, you'll wait a good 30 minutes just for a waiter or waitress to take your order. Then, you have to wait 45 minutes to an hour for your food to come out. 
I was there today and the waitress said \"we have a lot of parties so it may be a little slow for the pizza to come out.\" I appreciated her telling us that but it was AFTER we ordered (should have told us before we even sat down). Also, you're located right next to communities and office buildings; you should know that you're going to be crowded all the time. If you can't keep up with it, then the restaurants deserves to close down. 
I overheard the manager talking to another unhappy customer and was saying \"this is not normal for us.\" Interesting because, as I said, every single time I have come here, it's been slow."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times for a group happy hour. 

The first time, it was excellent.  Had a great waiter who stayed on top of things and even came over to remind us about happy hour ending and to see if we wanted any more drink orders so he could get them in before the cut off.

The second time, it was a bit worse.  We had a large group, and took up the entire patio.  However, there was only 1 waitress for about 40 of us.  She forgot orders, brought out wrong things, and had no idea who ordered which thing.  She overcharged me too many drinks that had already been paid for.

But since they have decent food, and GREAT prices during happy hour, we decided to come a third time.
Apparently the manager didn't appreciate our business because he immediately asked when we would be leaving.  He said that we take up the entire patio and no one else can sit out there because we take all the seats.  Mind you, every single person there is a customer.  Every single one of us ordered multiple drinks and plenty of food.  It's not like anyone was just sitting taking a seat, but not paying for anything.
This manager was so rude, that my co-workers debated leaving right then.  We will definitely not come back again.  We also do a fund raiser with them and our school once or twice a year.  We are planning on canceling that.

They have lost our business now, which is unfortunate.


If you have a large group, go elsewhere.  If you are looking for cheap drinks, and there's only a few of you, this is an okay place.  The pretzels are cheap and okay, nothing special.

My major compliment is that they have Wyder's Pear Cider, which is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The pretzel bites. Oh, the pretzel bites.  Why are they so good?  And the beer selection.  The beer selection is amazing.  I want to go there right now and have pretzel bites and beer for brunch!
GO! The Happy Hour will make you happy."}
{"text":"Amazing beers, tasty food.
Slightly odd waitstaff-but that can be fun too.
Their Happy Hour values are wonderful.
We literally ate everything on the HH menu and drank about 70% of the beers (we had a large crowd) and everything was lovely.  One note, we kinda were bored with the hummus.

GO!  EAT!  DRINK! DRINK SOME MORE! Then get a ride home!  We all did..."}
{"text":"Awful food and awful service.  I would recommend you skip this location and keep driving to the Happy Valley location where the food and service are great! Sitting with two small children, no crayons and the food taking over 45 minutes to arrive at our table wasn't the half of it.  The appetizer was cold and the lunch special pizzas that I purchased for my kids (thinking it would be better than the kids menu options) looked and tasted terrible.  In my opinion, they need to train their chef and wait staff over again."}
{"text":"We went there after a spring training game on a Sat. It was probably around 5:00 p.m. and not crowded at that hour.  We went in and sat at a booth by the bar.  I scanned the chalkboard list of beers (not even close to a list of all the beers they had on tap).  I asked the bartended if I could taste the nut brown ale and he immediately poured me a sampler at no charge (as it should be everywhere).  It was a bit bitter for my taste but our waiter had suggestions for us.  One of us said he like Shock Top (I know, I chastised him for his beer preference) and the waiter immediately suggested a Hef that my friend said was quite good.  I said I like Newcastle and he suggested a brown ale which was excellent.  A third member of our party selected one of the multiple porters available.
We ordered two pizzas, one with all meat on 1/2 and a specialty pizaa on the other half.  The other was 1/2 carne asada with kalamata olives (that has to be the most creative combination on a pizza that I've yet come across), the other 1/2 chicken, artichoke and garlic.  The crust on both pizzas was very good, thick but not overly filling.
The staff all seemed really friendly and casual.  If they're students (this is near ASU) they didn't come across as smug hipsters or anything of that sort.  They were genuinely friendly to us (3 40+ year olds and one teenage girl)."}
{"text":"Magical mystery tour pizza - absolutely awesome! This outfit is a class act with the best zah and beer in the valley. The management is everywhere making the experience unforgetable. The manager is Blake and what a hospitable host he was! He's determined that MM has no one above  it for food, service, and fun! I'll be back soon! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is the first time here.  Service was awesome and very helpful with suggestions.  Beer was really good.  Ordered meatball appetizer, flavors were good but meatballs were over cooked, still tasted good. 
Pizza was awesome and they use real mozzarella unlike some the the big pizza joints.  
Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker, I am never really into trying new pizza joints but I must confess Mellow Mushroom has won me over.  There pizza with garlic pesto swirl and oil drizzle is to die for plus the beer cheese drip is amaazzziinng.  They also always have a great list of beers on top including strongsville's greatest invention White Rajah!"}
{"text":"Good food but the prices are crazy. Long waits to get seated and once you are seated the entire establishment is so loud that we could not hear each other across the table and the waiter had to ask us to repeat our orders as he could not hear us. I like the food and beer but the prices and atmosphere are not my thing."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. In all honestly I was skeptical at first, but the bartenders and food made my experience 5 star worthy.  PJ was very knowledgable and he was my favorite bartender. He was very attentive and a genuinely nice person. I ordered the Thai curry pizza and wow was it full of flavor, I loved it. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been there once and only once. The decor is cool and funky for a family style place, but that's about all they have going for them. The pizza was terrible - about on par with Chucky Cheese."}
{"text":"Whoaaaaa!!! Completely overpriced!!!!! I ordered their Greek salad ToGo and as soon as I saw it, I knew it shouldn't be worth more than $5 for the small (which is what I ordered). The only reason I am even giving it two stars is because the staff was friendly when I said there's no way I am paying for that. There were barely any fixings on it and they wanted to charge me close to $8.17!!! I had almost gotten the regular size but changed my mind when she said it was close to $14. I lived in Georgia for a short period of time and their Greek salad was fantastic and full of fixings. This was quite the opposite. Don't waste your time with a salad here."}
{"text":"Their lunch specials are great for the price! Same with happy hour. I love the pretzels and beer cheese. Decent side salad and their hoagie sandwiches are awesome. I had an extremely lazy and unenthusiastic waiter for first experience. He didn't mention happy hour, he forgot our drink order, he didn't check back on us until our food was gone etc.. Luckily a neighboring server was much more friendly so I stopped him to converse. He was much more helpful and even gave my boyfriend and I free lunch special coupons to come back! I will be back again to try the pizza :)"}
{"text":"Last night was the first time I went to this location.  I will never go back.  Let me start with there was a WORM in my beer!!!  As soon as I noticed it and told the bartender, \"Ummmm, look what's in my beer.\" He QUICKLY took it away from me, poured it out and was going to give me the SAME beer that he just gave me from the same keg.  I yelled, \"no, no, no, no...Not having that beer.\"   He waited while I picked another drink. No apology for the worm.  No offer for a free drink.  
After we paid our bill, we finally saw a manager and told him about the worm.  He wasn't surprised, said they are sometimes in the lines??!  Then offered me 10 dollars off my next visit.  After he gave me the coupon, he said \"You should SEE the lines when we clean them!\"  I said, \"That's so gross, I can't even listen\" . You do NOT TELL customers that.  Honestly, I was disgusted all night and I will never go back there. It seemed dirty overall and I was afraid to eat their food."}
{"text":"I had the Thai Dye pizza last night and I'm still thinking about it! So amazing and original that I can't wait to try the other flavors this place has."}
{"text":"service was fine-but honestly, the food was pretty over-priced for what you got.  I ordered the vegan since I'm allergic to dairy.  There was almost no product on the pizza and I was charged quite a bit more than what the price of my husband's pizza was with the regular cheese and he had a LOT of it."}
{"text":"Service is bad. Our drinks were never refilled and she only checked on us once which was when she dropped our pizza off.


Update to review: the owner, Jay, had responded to my review within minutes. As someone that works in a similar business, I appreciated his response. That type of customer service changed my original 2 star review to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Me and my colleagues went yesterday for  bday  in  this restaurant  i got cheese pizza and salada the crust is very good well made .every body on the table is happy with the service too.Definitely  i will be back"}
{"text":"pretty uninteresting...bland doughy pizza....and why in the world is a 20oz beer $750...on top of my $26 pizza...not busy on a Saturday night...now you know why...nice Cesar salad but would be nice to have a serving utensil"}
{"text":"My wife and I never get out due to kids. So, when we do we expect standard service from our server.  Rarely do I get what I would consider standard service and trust me when I say my expectations are not that high.   This mellow mushroom exceeded our  expectations, specifically a server named Tamara.  This girl was constantly checking in on is to ensure our drinks were always filled and we were ok.  I can't even recall a time in the past that I was treated like this.   It was refreshing to actually be waited on knowing you don't have to go flag your server down.  She is setting the standard and the service at this mellow mushroom (because we've been to a couple)  should be an example to other mellow mushrooms."}
{"text":"I really like the reverse happy hour here.  

Minus 1 star because I was slightly disappointed with their pretzels.  I thought they were a little overcooked and not doughy enough.

The Beer Cheddar sauce was worth the extra money."}
{"text":"We Munched our faces off here at Mellow Mushroom.  This place has a lot to offer.  Delicious pizzas and good brew.  Four of us went and had a good time.  The service was slow but we had good conversation so we didn't mind it too much.  I dig the t shirts they have for sale and they do a good job to encompass the Mill Ave atmosphere really well.  Pick any pizza, any pizza, I dare you, and you will enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza, beer and service, not their new prices.  They had a huge price increase recently that has the price for a large pizza at $35 with tax and tip.  

It is pizza, not prime steak or lobster. CRAZY!!!"}
{"text":"They don't validate parking. Even with $100+ tab? Really? Wow. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"Such a fantastic place!!! I love everything about Mellow Mushroom... Food, Drinks, Atmosphere, Artwork/Decor! If you have never tried one, you're missing out.

My favorite: Holy Shiitake pizza"}
{"text":"Keyssa was an extremely attentive and aware bartender. Great conversation and recommendations for a west coast visitor. My pizza was on point and my glass was never empty. If only I had more time on this vacation to go back again."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant to try MM. However, tonight was my friends birthday so we all met here for dinner...
The ambiance of the restaurant is very \"chain like\", not really what I was expecting(yes, I do know it's a chain).
Our server, Ashley, was very nice, and attentive. She didn't let any of our drinks go with out refills, and she split our large table's check for us with out us even having to ask!
The food was pretty good. We had the drunken fun guy(?) appetizer and the BBQ chicken pizza. Both were good, not amazing, but good. Everything tasted a little 'processed' or maybe just not very fresh. The crust was good and crisp, but had an almost microwaved texture to it, like it was old...
I might give them another try, I just don't know if it's really the place for me..."}
{"text":"I hate giving a two star review seeing as I am a server and I work in a restaurant as well.. but I have given the bar here two chances and have regretted it each time. when I sit at the tables my service is fine, but when I'm up at the bar, I feel like I'm invisible or don't even exist. the same bar tender has helped me both times. I look younger then I am, and I don't drink.. but come on guys. took him 10 minutes to greet us.. then another 3 to get our drinks.. and another 7 to even ask us what we wanted. we orders some apps and let him know we wanted a pizza later. didn't see him again for 20 min after we finished our wings. the other bartender didn't even acknowledge us the entire time and I even saw him SAMPLE A BEER AND THEN POUR THE REST INTO A PITCHER AND GIVE IT TO A CUSTOMER. I would understand if they were busy.. I totally get it.. but that fact that they were to busy joking with the rest of the staff was what really pissed me off. still have him 20%, but he should know he gave us probably the worst service I've ever had.. and like I said.. I'm a server myself. I get it. oh well.. won't be returning here."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been to Mellow Mushroom.  We had a party of 6  and were seated immediately.  The service here was less than stellar.  Our first server took our order.  We ordered a pretzel appetizer to begin and somewhere along the line it disappeared - along with our server.  We had to flag down another server to inquire about the missing appetizer.  They had no idea what happened to it and resubmitted the order and comped us for it.  That was cool.  Shortly after we finished our pretzels, our pizza order was brought to the table.  The pizza was.... okay.  I'm not sure why, but I was expecting something better.  A few of us agreed that the toppings were good, but the crust was blah.  Oddly enough, the crust and the pretzel had the same texture and flavor.  We had to flag another server down to refresh our drinks.  We also had to flag our original server down to get our bill.  So, overall, the service was very poor and the food was mediocre.  It was unanimous that we will probably not come back here."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and staff was friendly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great place to grab a beer and have a great meal in a chill atmosphere. Our waitress Melissa was very nice and on the ball with service and updating us on our food status! Was a great first experience and I am looking forward to my next visit! Thanks and happy Father's Day"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, reverse happy hour special , especially the wings and pretzels. Beer is obviously the best part"}
{"text":"This location seems very new and the building is so cool looking.  They tried to make it look like an old movie theater that was converted to a restaurant, so there is lots of movie memorabilia around and also theater eats in the waiting area near the hostess stand.

Other than the decor, me and my friend weren't really wowed by the food.  We ordered the chopped salad, which was basically just a lot of lettuce and not much else (very FEW tomatoes and olives and sunflower seeds).  I don't really get what made it a \"chopped\" salad as differentiated from a regular salad.  Also, the dressing claimed to be a vinaigrette, but what came out was a creamy almost Ranch-like dressing.... odd.

For the pizza we were excited to try vegan cheese bc we can't eat dairy.  The nice thing is that you can sub vegan cheese on any of their pizzas.  But the Daiya cheese they used just isn't very good!  The first bite of it is decent, but after the first bite it starts just tasting weird...  I think I would've preferred a pizza with no cheese than this fake cheese.  If they are going to offer vegan cheese, they should look for a better option or possibly make their own.  I will say I did enjoy the crust of the pizza!  The bread was nice and doughy with a good crispiness to the outside.

Lastly, service was NOT good.  Our poor waitress was really nice, but just overworked.  She forgot to bring us silverware when we sat down and then when our salad arrived, we still didn't have silverware.  And we couldn't flag her down to get any silverware for another 10+ minutes, that's how busy she was!  But then after that she was checking in with us a lot -- of course then we didn't need anything."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, The crust is by far the best in the area."}
{"text":"We always get the mega veggie here because it's so darn addicting! The biggest downfall is that it's SO expensive! We decided to go with a large instead of a medium...don't do it! They're pretty much the same size but cost more."}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot! My husband and I love it here the food is incredible. They let you spit specialty pizzas so you can try something new. Anthony was our server twice now and both times he was awesome. He really knows the menu and has a great attitude."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for unique craft beers with an incredible happy hour half price on all appetizers and all liquor and draft beers. Plus Groupons that they except during happy hour plus an incredible staff friendly knowledgeable helpful and incredible bartenders such as Jenna must come and get some food and beers open late everyday till 2. Happy hour from 3 to 6 & 9 to close daily. Plus they have excellent wings and very good pizza with unique toppings."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer and some pretzels. Their cheese is the bomb. Staff is friendly and attentive. Will be coming back. Try the old chub nitro if you're a Guinness lover, yum!"}
{"text":"Great place for some drinks. 

Came in here and went straight to the bar with about 20 friends who all just came from the same reception event. We had some folks who were under 21, so it was great that there were some tables where they could sit and also order some food and non-alcoholic drinks. 

For those of us 21 and up, we were just glad to be relaxing with a pretty massive selection of craft beers to try out. I don't remember what it's called, but there's a particular craft beer that tastes like an orange creamsicle -- that is definitely the one I would recommend! It's a local craft beer. I'm sure if you asked the bartender, they'll know which one. 

They also have lots of fun happy hours. I'll definitely be back. The staff seemed pretty nice!"}
{"text":"A solid pizza place with a diverse menu and awesome bar. Pricey though.

The Parmesan pretzels and Ceasar salad were very good. The Maui Wowwee pizza was delicious. The wings weren't my kinda wings, but if you don't want them deep fried, theirs are the way to go. They're not at all soggy - just not as crispy as deep fried gets ya.

My mule and margarita - both good. Beer selection, great. 

I like their bar a lot - friendly bartenders who make their signature drinks like pros, and garage doors that allow for full sunshine (a plus for day drinking).

My only complaint is the same as all the other yelpers' that I've read. These pizzas are overpriced. They're good. But overpriced.  

Atmosphere is not at all 'mellow.' Buzzing and lively, as it should be. Colorful decor. Lots of TVs. Jam packed on a Saturday night. 

All in all I say: Try It!!"}
{"text":"This review is only for the Mellow Mushroom House Special pizza.   I am a Foodie and combination pizza and crab are my favorite foods.  My favorite pizza in Phoenix metro is Mellow Mushroom's House Special, because of the crispy applewood smoked bacon in it, and I love combo pizzas.  I discovered their pizza when they ran the Groupon $10 for $20.  Mellow Mushroom really packs on the ingredients and spreads to the edges, but the crust is not crispy and can never be made crispy the way I like it by baking it longer, probably because of the dough ingredients.   I tried asking restaurant to bake pizza longer for  \"extra crispy crust\", but it does not make for a crispier crust, just drys out the ingredients.  I would give House Special pizza 5 stars if the crust could get crispy and crunch when you bite into it and not flop downward (wimpy).    I love it when my teeth find the crispy applewood bacon pieces crunching in my mouth.  Ummmmm, makes me happy!  The House Special pizza is so good, I have not ventured to order anything else here.  Freezing the pieces and then toasting on my toaster oven rack on another day, is a special treat, I can get the crust crispier at home.

I have not had bad service here either and I like to sit with my laptop and eat pizza alone.  I have to come here after 10 pm weekdays for free parking and quieter atmosphere, another reason for not giving it 5 stars.  

Grimaldi's has good pizza too, for me, anyhow.  I like thin CRISPY crust that crunches even in the center when you bite into it, and slice stays horizontal even 30 min after coming out of the oven.  

I have tried Pizzeria Bianco at 20th and Camelback, horrid ( like spoiled milk) and overpriced, the only pizza I ever sent back to order something else, in my 64 years  life, see my Pizzeria Bianco review.  

I have not tried Cibo's.  I like pizza with lotsa stuff on it, like combos, so Cibo's is probably not my place either.  Anyone have other recommendations, based on the kind of pizza I described I like here, I welcome your suggestions."}
{"text":"Not toddler friendly. But most places aren't. My kid was completely obsessed with the King Kong and climbing the stairs to see the herbivorous dinosaur."}
{"text":"So I have a pretty critical review of this place from my experiences last night. I just got off of work and met up with some friends to grab some dinner for my friends birthday. As soon as we walk in we are greeted with a rough looking guy demanding our ID's and being pretty stern. I thought I was walking in a douche bag party bar or club not a restaurant. There were two other groups there trying to get in and people handing ID's over top of each other. It was very disorganized and irritating but what ever. We got our ID's checked and our wrist bands so we could sit down to dinner.....

So we got sat and handed some menu's. Our waitress asked for our ID's again and was confused as to why we had wrist bands on. We told her the guy up front took our ID's already and wrist banded us. She walked away real quickly and came back telling us not to worry about showing her our ID's again. We gave her our drink orders and she came back pretty quickly. We needed a little more time to look over the menu so she came back. 

I looked over the menu and was not terribly impressed. The food selection was blah but I figured it is a pizza place and their pizza selection was pretty decent so not a huge deal. I ended up getting a spiked sausage hoagie. It was small and unimpressive. It came with chips that tasted like they dumped them out of a lays bag. It was not a hoagie but more just a few small slices of sausage with huge chunks of green bell peppers with melted cheese between two tiny slices of bread. It tasted ok but for $9 I expected a lot more. 

The service was slow, like really slow. the waitress could have easily doubled or tripled her alcohol sales if she would have just hustled a little. Our food orders came out one at a time with a few minutes between each plate. Some of my friends split a moderately sized pizza that looked ok, I didn't try it. Another ordered a calzone that was also moderately sized. And the last friend ordered a personal pizza. Everyone was really surprised at how small my sandwich was, I am really glad I didn't get a half sandwich. One of my friends gave me a slice of his personal pizza a BBQ chicken pizza of some kind that was better than my sandwich. 

To kind of summarize this entire review the food is alright, the service was incredibly slow, the bouncer/security guy was annoying, and the prices are ridicules. You can go to any other restaurant on mill, even any of the other pizza places and get more and better food for your money. I don't know why people rave about this place at all, makes me think they have no idea what good pizza is supposed to be."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Mellow Mushroom is very energetic & different, Mellow Mushroom puts a fun spin on pizza as a style by having fun styles while still offering the basics if you'd like to keep things simple. The beer selection is a very good offering many options to choose from. The food was delicious, they also let you order half & half if you'd like to try different pizzas. The prices are on the higher side, but the food is worth it, just expect to have a bill of about $50 for those who are cautious of prices."}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person who likes to eat food that's sweet and savory at the same time. So when I ordered the Maui Wowie I was a skeptic from the start. But once the steaming slice of pizza choo-choo'd its way into my mouth, my mind was all-aboard, and my heart followed. From the first bite you'll be taken away to a savory trip filled with pesto, jerk chicken, banana peppers, Applewood smoked bacon and just the right amount of pineapple to satisfy any sweet tooth, to the last bite of crust, that you can trust, is genuinely amazing. I've also tried the House Special, Red Skin Potato Pie and the Buffalo Chicken, which have all impressed me, and kept me coming back for another round. So hop on board and don't get left behind, join the Mellow Mushroom ride!

PS food is amazing, but the service was on the funky side. I know it gets busy, but c'monnnn!"}
{"text":"Honesty we've been a couple times -  the one in Tempe is the best! Service was great!! Management is great! I'd have a hard time  picking somewhere else to go on Mill."}
{"text":"Visiting my brother-in-law for a few days, we stopped in for a Sunday lunch hoping to catch a football game and some good grub before we left. Good grub, check, football, notsomuch. I'll explain.

All the TV's at the Mellow Mushroom are packed around the bar area, which is to one side of the restaurant, and none of them really point into the dining room. So if you have a larger party, it isn't really ideal for watching the game.

But this was the sole area of disappointment. We started out with two appetizers: a toasted bread with a cheesy olive spread on top, and a plate of pretzels with beer cheese. The bread wasn't really my thing (not an olive fan), but the pretzels and cheese were top notch. The beer cheese is a melted cheese sauce that goes great with the salty, hot pretzels.

They have a bunch of local and regional beers, and our waitress had no problem letting me sample a few because I wasn't familiar with any of them being Cali born and raised. I don't remember what I ordered, but it was a dark red IPA that was cold and refreshing on an August day in Phoenix.

We ordered two pizzas; a mushroom pizza and a meat pizza. I was surprised to find that I preferred the mushroom pizza, but then considering the name of the joint, it was probably a good call. The waitress had bragged about the pizza dough earlier, and I tuned out what she was saying because, you order pizza for the toppings, not the dough, right? Well, ideally, the dough accents the topping perfectly. I think they put molasses in it or something, maybe it is wheat based. It's good though, and I might eat that dough by itself.

Great overall, good service, and I look forward to coming across the Mellow Mushroom again."}
{"text":"Went here for the pizza... I'd been craving vegan pizza since cutting dairy a few months ago. They were very accommodating to my #dairyfree #soyfree lifestyle and the waitress was very helpful and patient in asking my questions back and forth with the kitchen. 

LOVE that they open the big front garage doors with giant metal fans to catch great breezes in the summertime! 

The food was good, I built a custom personal pan pizza with shitake mushrooms and Carmelized red onion. Honestly though, it had slightly LESS flavor than I was hoping. Next time I would add something spicy or bolder into my toppings. It is still worth trying again, as I loved the staff's friendliness and helpfulness. 

The decor was fun, colorful, and silly, with lots of artwork, but the open floor plan kept it feeling spacious, not overstimulating or obnoxious."}
{"text":"We had a great time tonight.  Half price wine during happy hour and a delicious pizza.  A note to the restaurant manager .... why did you get rid of brand named Chardonnay?  The waitress said beer is the #1 seller.  You are now serving disgusting Chardonnay and why?  Not everyone is a beer drinker but obviously, you don't care.  I like a really nice glass of Chardonnay and Canyon Road is awful.  Please, reconsider and have at least one good Chardonnay on the menu.  Can the Sauvignon Blanc be replaced with a great Chardonnay.  Otherwise, we really like Mellow Mushroom."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places! I like the variety of the menu, the great flavor of the crust & the wonderful service that we always get.. No matter if we create our own or order one of the specialty pizza they are always great!  Their calzones are just a good & could feed two people! They also have a great build your own salad on the menu that I have never seen before. A must try!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place forever and finally got out to give it a whirl. We walked in and were able to get a table pretty quickly. Everything was clean and decorated funky - in a good way. Our server was prompt and really friendly, one of the best servers I've had recently. 

There were a ton of menu options, but pizza was definitely on the list of things to try. At first I was a little disappointed because they don't offer any 'run-of-the-mill' options and didn't list anything about building your own pizza. So, if you're expecting a cheese pizza, pepperoni or sausage, or anything not loaded with other ingredients, this may not be the place for you. All the pizza options have LOTS of ingredients piled on, and that's not necessarily a bad thing if you don't want anything more traditional. 

I went for one with a red sauce, I don't even remember the name. It wasn't bad, is was decent. They definitely took care in the ingredients and the dough, but there was way too much cheese and it made it greasy. Overall, I wasn't that impressed. Maybe I was expecting a little bit more.

My friend got a calzone and he was not happy with it at all. I did try a bite and didn't like it either. The dough tasted sweet and was more of a cardboard texture. It was definitely not like a normal calzone you would get at an Italian joint. 

I might go back to try their sandwiches or hoagies, but I wouldn't go for the pizza and Mellow is definitely not on my list of places to return to any time soon."}
{"text":"The food is terrible. The service  even worse. I love the beer selection and the bartenders! But for some reason the servers just can't get it right. I will go back but only if friends suggest it but I'll always let them know my opinion first but everyone is different and I support that!"}
{"text":"It's conveniently located and there are a bunch of beers on tap here. We like the food, but it can be pricey. The atmosphere is fine, but nothing exciting. Their pizza is good, but it isn't anything amazing. They have unique toppings and combinations on a pretzel crust, but their sauces are pretty flat/one-note in flavor. Their service is fine, but we have never received great service. There are a ton of tvs above the bar that you can see from almost anywhere in the restaurant so you can keep tabs on the game if you want (and one of them is ALWAYS on the food channel for you non-sports people). We like it, but don't love it. We keep going back, but it is more due to convenience of location/vibe than anything else."}
{"text":"Ok, but can't compare with the pizza greats. While I was waiting for my carry out pie, I watched as one of the cooks in the open kitchen was trying to hand toss  some dough, with less than stellar results; It made me wonder if this was the in-house entertainment they intended.
I ordered a oil and garlic pie, with anchovies, sun dried tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. Again the pie was ok, but I wish it was at least more well done than it was. Also, I didn't see any evidence of fresh mootz. Maybe, here in the south, they just don't know about that stuff? Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is horrible!  Took more than 10 min for our server to greet us.  Order drinks.  Wine was horrible.  Asked for a different type. Took forever to get it. The waitress said it took so long because she wanted to make sure the manager approved taking the other glass off our bill (which she did not remove). Three of the four meals arrived together. Fourth one came out after everyone else finished. As soon as the last meal was brought out the check was dropped on us.  We wanted to enjoy the afternoon and order another glass of wine after we finished (and after the check was dropped).  When we ordered it took quite some time for the waitress to come back at which point she declared there was no more wine.  What restaurant runs out of wine at 4:30 on a Friday of a holiday weekend?!?"}
{"text":"I love their pizza and beer menu. A little pricey for a pie but they are phenomenal pizzas IMO. I love the Buffalo Chicken and Holy Shitake! Usually its pretty easy to get a seat w/o a long wait time and service has been pretty good the last couple times I have been there. Up in this neck of the woods there aren't too many places which a decent beer selection"}
{"text":"Came in with a friend for a white pie or so I thought.  After waiting 15 mins still no one came to ask what we wanted.  They were not that busy, there was one waitress that was coming back and forth, never once said I'll be with you in a minute, nothing.  So we left fur another place to eat.  Guess it will be awhile before I go back there....too bad"}
{"text":"great music service and food. fair prices and large portions. really pretty setup as well"}
{"text":"Tried Mellow Mushroom for the first time and was blown away!!!!!  This location has plenty of seating inside and has a really nice covered patio area with heaters. Started our meal with the pretzel bites.  They were delicious!  They had a good garlic/Parmesan flavor that wasn't overwhelming--perfect. It came with a PBR beer cheese for dipping which was also really good but had the strongest beer flavor of any beer cheese I've ever had (I still dipped every bite).  I ordered the great white pizza with Italian sausage instead of mushrooms (as recommended for substitution by my server) and it was an amazing pizza!!  The crust was the best part!  Had great flavor as did the rest of it. I ordered the small and I had leftovers. My friend ordered a calzone and loved it. Also said the crust was the best part. I can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of mellow mushroom for years so when I moved out here and found out there was a mellow mushroom down the street from me I was ecstatic. Sad to say, two of the three times I have been to this restaurant I've been very disappointed. The first time I ordered the Hawaii pizza (I don't remember it's named on the menu) and I kid you not each slice of pizza had two, TWO tiny pieces of pineapple, maybe three pieces of ham and no cheese. It was basically just bread. I wish I had a picture because it would be impossible for anyone with eyes to look at that pizza and say that it was made properly. 

Took me a long time to go back. But I finally did and I got the holy shiitake mushroom pizza. It was AMAZING. Lots of mushrooms and the sauce is phenomenal. So I went back again and got the same thing. IT WAS TERRIBLE. again, only two tiny slices of mushroom on each slice. It was basically cheese bread. 

I don't know what is going on with their pizza guy. But I think that is totally unacceptable for this to happen for the prices they charge. I will forever love Mellow Mushroom. But this location has lost my business.

Also side note: each time I got take out. Therefore could not send it back. But if I was sitting down at the restaurant I would of for sure sent that bad boy back."}
{"text":"Recently I've been going to Mellow Mushroom a lot more than my past 5 years living in Charlotte and it's been the best. As a vegan their gluten free crust and Daya \"cheese\" option is the best thing that could have happened to me and my relationship with pizza. They're really friendly in this location and helpful too. The pizza itself could take a little while to come out but as long as it tastes good and everyone has a good attitude then I don't mind. The employees make sure to tell you it might take a while and check to see if you're good. When I ordered over the phone to pick up and got there the pizza took a while to come out. But again the guy at the bar (wish I could remember his name) kept apologizing and reassuring me, which I think was really nice of him since a lot of restaurants simply ignore you until they have to hand you the food. Awesome restaurant with awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom used to be one of my favorite pizza places to eat. Im still in love with the fun environment not sure if they still host trivia Tuesdays but that was always fun as well. Since i have moved to Steele creek area the ballantyne location is closest to me. Things are pretty much the same at this location except for the longest it took us a while to realize the table we were sitting at the table top was actually an iPad ,talk about cool! We ordered the Mediterranean pizza, thanks to yelp when i checked in they offered a free humus or bruschetta with the order of a pizza , so that was a big plus. I had a moscow mule to wash all of this down. Everything as usual was delicious."}
{"text":"First time customer and the experience was great. It was an unusually warm day and they had the garage doors open so that was very nice. I ordered the holy shitake mushroom pizza, a meatball appetizer and small house salad. The mushroom pizza I believe was drizzled in truffle oil it was outstanding! The restaurant has 3 d artwork and a lot of seating. There is parking in the front and the back of the location."}
{"text":"Yum! Every time I visit Arizona I make sure to eat me some mellow mushroom. They have a fabulous beer selection. The mushroom pizza is my personal favorite. They are open late too."}
{"text":"I want to talk about customer service . This pizza is half red skin potato, half house special . I ordered this combination for the first time last week . Normally we order half Maui Wowie , half Mighty Meaty. BOTH DELICIOUS . Today I was craving this pictured combination . Especially the House Special. When I got home and opened my pizza hours later (I had several unexpected runs in between ), I realized that the other half of the pizza was definitely not a house special . Now normally I wouldn't care , because everything this pizzeria touches turns to gold , but I just had to call and say something . When people call to \"complain\"'they normally expect some kind of result . Maybe $5.00 off the next pizza or something. But I didn't get that . I got MORE . A manager who not only is remaking my pizza as we speak , but is also offering me a gift card . We've eaten at Mellow Mushroom at least three times this month . But this boost in service is refreshing and comforting . No bad reviews here , only great food , and service ."}
{"text":"This will always be my favorite pizza place. The Kosmic Karma, Umami, and magic mushroom pizzas are are amazing. Don't even get me started on their pretzels... Especially the cinnamon honey ones."}
{"text":"Food: good.
Beer selection: great.
Service: wamp wamp...  Waitress was awesome but Staff yelled at our kids twice and manager wouldn't come out to see us when we requested him. Probably baked on mushrooms."}
{"text":"Good isn't very good. It's like Applebees quality and selections. But for the price, it's even worse. I always vote no for co worker gatherings here."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom has the best crust I've ever had on any pizza in Phoenix. We always end up buying the Hawaiian with extra onion and green pepper and mild wings. Both my 2 and 6 year-old kids loves it."}
{"text":"After a couple recent visits I can't help but notice that Mellow Mushroom just isn't the place it was when it first opened.  I remember enjoying full pints of St.Berardus Christmas Ale at happy hour prices as well as other \"high gravity\" options that were served in normal glasses.  Now they're in smaller glasses that look like a highball or rocks glass, but the price isn't smaller.   When I go in prime dining hours somehow 3 of us can rack up a tab exceeding $100 and it just seems a bit extreme for pizza 'n beers.  This isn't the Biltmore or Kierland.  It's a very middle class area and I'm not sure how the prices are a good match for folks who live nearby and dine here.

But it's not just the prices I guess.  It seems like a lot of the servers are not happy and give attitude, and I'm a very polite person in public so I know it wasn't me. 

At the bar last winter I've chatted with a guy who knows a lot about beer but lately it seems the bartenders are just attractive females who don't really know craft beer, and the overall demographic in the bar isn't the same.  Call me an old fart, but I'd rather talk about West Coast beers than have all the eye candy.  Also they have all these wonderful beers but it seems like everyone around me was ordering Coors' Blue Moon.  Why can't those people just hang out at TGI Friday's?"}
{"text":"Food seems about the same as other locations I've been too - overall fairly good quality, good prices at happy hour or lunch specials, and overpriced at any other time.  Location has good daytime parking because City North is so incredibly dead.  Staff are still learning the ropes so they get a pass on slowness and such.

Major obnoxious aspects exist for the beer situation here, as if the person in charge of it is rather ignorant of beer basics.  

First, there's a large section of rotating taps from breweries but the menu doesn't list the exact beers (we're talking 18-20 of these unknown beers).  But then the server doesn't know which ones are in the rotating tap section of the menu.  The bartender doesn't know them.  You have to look at the handles yourself.  Yardhouse has a digital \"chalkboard\" to show what's rotating.  Other places have disposable & easily replaceable menus for these rotating beers.  But not here.  Imagine if they did this with the food, having a section of 18 or so entrees but nobody can tell you what they are.  You have to look in the kitchen yourself.

Second, the regular beers are ignorantly organized.  There's a section for \"ales\", but then spearate sections for wheat beers, witbiers, porters, and stouts - which are.... guess what... all ales.   And then there's the German doppelbock listed under stout/porter (it is neither).  It's a lager, but not in the lager section.  

Third, the insanity continues with the obsessive labeling of beers as vegan or not, yet this is not exactly a place with a lot of vegan menu options.  

Finally, for a big beer list sort of place - they have no German beers.  None.  British beers?  none. Zero.  Belgian beers? hardly - just Stella and one witbier.  Sigh. There's an enormous American skewing of the taplist to say the least."}
{"text":"\"Uhm, we don't give out change here\"... yes that's what I was told at the to-go register when I parked a few feet from the door at a metered parking spot by the restaurant, and merely asked to break a dollar so our party could eat here.  They don't give change.  They don't have a dedicated lot - they have metered parking right outside their doors.  Grrrrreat policy, Mellow Mushroom.

Food is on a par with the other MM in town.  Service varies depending on the server, many of which have attitudes.  Draft list is long, but much of it isn't of much interest to anyone who's been into craft beer for awhile.  

Good location on Mill.  Looks like that's why they'll stay in business, and for no other reason."}
{"text":"I first saw Mellow Mushroom when I was in Atlanta on business recently, and I was intrigued. I didn't get a chance to go then, so when I saw that they had arrived in Tempe, and the Groupon came out, I was excited to give it a try.

On the recommendation of some friends who have eaten there, we organized an outing. I was really excited by the menu; lost of interesting sounding vegetarian options. The beer selection is impressive (try the orange blossom-yum!).

The stuffed portabello appetizer was disappointing. The pizzas were okay; I liked the Magical Mystery Tour better than the Gourmet White for sure, but neither was super amazing.

The service was okay; there were a few mishaps, people being given the wrong beer, check splitting was a little too complicated even with advance notice, but nothing awful.

The atmosphere is decent; I imagine the original one was super fun and quirky, but replicating that in a chain almost never works.

I will probably go back to try some of the things that sounded good that I didn't get to try last time; but it is a bit pricey, probably overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"First of all let me say that the customer service was really really good. there is a movie theme inside the restaurant which is confusing since the name does not indicate anything movie related. I called and got take out but when I got home I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality of food.  I ordered $28 worth of food and ended up giving it away to my buddy who doesn't have a lot of food but loves to eat. Eww"}
{"text":"The food there is not bad, just very confused about the decision that their corporate offices made to remove to key things from the menu.  Went there on Sunday specifically because I had a taste for their signature portabello mushroom appetizer.  I am also a big fan of the portabello sandwich, both of which were discontinued.  It's called Mellow mushroom right?  The pizza and wings are okay, but I go there for the mushroom things on the menu.  Can get pizza and wings any number of other places. Why would you all discontinue signature mushroom items on your menu when your establishment is called...the Mellow Mushroom???  Not coming back.
Patty"}
{"text":"This is a little sad for me to write. I used to love coming here for the interesting craft beer selection. It was really the only place near me to have a good draft. Recently, it has spiraled down into a run of the mill, non-creative disappointment of the same old same old. The service is VERY inconsistent and so is the food. In fact, a lot of the national Mellow Mushroom fun and interesting menu items are not offered here. Therefore, unless I hear that they are going to offer a wider selection of craft beers and maybe some LOCAL brews, I can't recommend heading here and will have to get back in the car and drive... Boo. Sad."}
{"text":"We watched this locale do their 'build-out', train new employees for weeks, offer free stuff on the sidewalk, open with crowds and have tried it twice.  Two strikes they are done!!  Horrible service, just terrible.  We spoke with two other tables last night and they too were quite disappointed.  We left, letting the 'hostess' know why we were leaving (waited more than 10 minutes and NO attention given us).  There were plenty of employees and place was not full.  We went to Fuel Pizza in Uptown and were quite happy with delicious pizza and beer.  Your loss, Mellow Mushroom!!  You've lost not only customers but neighbors who live two blocks away and who will spread the word on your bad service."}
{"text":"Great service the GM there is super cool. Couldn't of had a better time. Came in and the crew there had a lot of fun and it was a unique experience. I have been to other locations but this one really set itself apart."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food and cocktails were very good. The bartender and cooks know what they're doing. The pesto breadsticks, kosmic karma and cheese pizza were very good. The rosemary and mule cocktail was surprisingly refreshing! 

The vibe and customer service though....left much to be desired, I wonder if maybe we came on an off night but there wasn't a personality to put with this place. I mean if the intended experience is come sit while random people tend and serve your table with  little to no customer relation skills, then yes they nailed it. 

I'd definitely sit at the bar next time."}
{"text":"being a no cheese pescatarian its very hard to find things that i wish i could eat (like pizza) that has a non dairy option. i am thrilled and relieved that i can enjoy pizza again! i had the vegan mushroom pizza which has shitake mushrooms and it was so good i ate the whole thing. love it."}
{"text":"I went in with a buddy a couple weeks ago and most of their menu had pot references. Personally I don't agree. It was too much. They're brownie  looked delicious. Our service was quite slow."}
{"text":"I came here during a Panthers game in Uptown and the food was amazing! Our server Shannon was very nice and made the experience perfect. We need more servers like her."}
{"text":"Beer selection is amazing ! You can get any type of craft american and local brews.  Thick pizza and baked wings aren't my thing. I have indulged in a few slices soak up the beer  , no regrets , but I mostly come here for the beer."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this dinning experience. Not only was the order late, it was burnt, cold and incorrect. Save your time and money with this location."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom is one of our favorite restaurants. We used to order from here every single Friday. The pizza is usually really good, with quality ingredients, and a delicious crust. We always get a 'create your own' with sausage and jalape√±os. (Fyi, I don't like sausage or jalape√±os, but the combo is delicious.) 

My main complaint with this Mellow is their consistency. We ordered from this Mellow every single week from October '15 - February '18. We typically ordered around 4:00 on a Friday, and the pizza was usually decent. But, idk why, whenever we ordered from here on another night (Sat or Sun), or at a busier time, the pizza sucked. Every time we ordered on Sundays, there was about 50% less toppings than on Friday. Unfortunately it's consistent enough that we noticed the quality difference and quit ordering on Sundays. Another time the entire bottom was crusted black. (Idk what that was about. It wasn't burnt, just covered in this black crust.) It was really strange. I was also vegan for a year of our stay, and ordering a vegan calzone from here was a disaster! The inside was completely raw from the moisture of the vegan cheese, and several times my calzone was inedible. But after enough complaints and pictures sent to the manager, they actually changed their method of making them and it was much better!

Another thing is that I always ordered \"very light sauce\" every single time. I intentionally repeat it because I really dislike sauce, and the person who takes the order always confirms. But no joke, we actually got light sauce maybe 1x per month, if we were lucky. I'm not sure if they just don't have a standard of what light sauce is, (1/2 of normal amount, or whatever) and so it just varies depending on who makes your pizza, but it sucks because once we waited 30-45 mins to pick it up, and drive out there, we didn't want to wait longer for them to remake it when it's obviously not light sauce. They did get better about this toward the end of our stay in Cleveland though, so we continued ordering from here faithfully. 

When they make the pizza right, it's amazing. We've gotten all our friends hooked because it's so good. We've had our ups and downs with this location, but I still gave it 4 stars because we like Mellow Mushroom and would definitely still recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is terrible. No joke, just bad.  Beer selection is good. The only reason to come would be for the beer selection but that is just not enough. The pizza was by far the most disappointing thing I've eaten in a long while. DONT get the pizza."}
{"text":"Pricy but the beer is cold, it's on Mill so be prepared for drunk kids everywhere."}
{"text":"Checked out the Mellow Mushroom last night... I am still kicking myself for not visiting this place sooner!  The places along Selwyn have been sprouting up left and right so the area is pretty nice to spend an evening in.  Never-the-less, I was super hungry when I parked and ventured in with a friend.  It was a Tuesday night so there were a ton of tables available (none in the bus though :(  oh well).  Tuesday nights is apparently trivia night so we walked in halfway through the 2nd round of questions.  It was actually kind of fun racking our brains for the answers (while we were waiting on our food) but not really playing at the same time.

I ordered the 10\" Kosmic Karma... man was it good.  All the pizza is baked to order so it may be a wait for the food - SO WORTH IT THOUGH.  To entertain you, you could probably order an appetizer or sample their extensive beer selection.

The staff seemed to be a mixture of people and very laid back.... don't expect quick service here, but I guess the lackadaisical service adds to the mood of the place.  I didn't really mind it too much.

The only downside I did take note of was the noise level of the restaurant... granted there was trivia going on so there wasn't any music playing but maybe it was a combo of the HVAC, the kitchen, and all the conversations around us...."}
{"text":"The food was great. You can configure your pizza or calzone to your personal tastes...mine was jerk chicken, roma tomatoes, onions and broccoli.  The dough is different than anything else I've tasted.  It almost tastes like pretzel dough.

The only thing that was weird was the table configuration. I was with a group of 8 people.  We were seated in a big booth with 2 tables and a walking space between the two tables. It made conversation to the other table difficult since the restaurant was so loud.

Other things I love about this is the decor at the bar...there are lava lamps on the wall behind the bar.  Very Cool!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place just last night. I just moved to the area a week ago from Las Vegas so had to get used to places being closed at night. Originally went out looking to grab a burger at Carl's Jr. across the street since yelp said it was open only to find it wasn't. Then drove looking for the IHOP and pulled into the center this place was located. Saw lots of cars parked at midnight so I went as it was open and starving. I went to the bar and had to wait nearly over 5 minutes before the bartenders even acknowledged me. Was about to walk out until they noticed me and greeted me very friendly. Most times I would've walked out from me waiting without being acknowledged but in all fairness it was semi busy that night. 
The food selection seems good I chose the pizza since I loved how they had blue cheese and ricotta cheese available so I ordered it both. The staff bartenders that night were Brooke and Marlena both very friendly. 
There was one staffer asking me if I was drinking or not at the bar to which I responded no as I don't drink at all. Had a feeling he was asking since I was open carrying my firearm as I always do. Not sure what their policy on guns is but if they're open carry friendly then I will always support their business and become a regular. I'm looking for a nearby neighborhood restaurant to be a fixture at and this place could be one since it's just down the street from my home and open late everyday. 
Will give this place a few more visits at various days and times to see if it's a good fit for me visiting regularly"}
{"text":"i wanted something different and had to find a middle point, there are many restaraunts in the area but nothing great, we decided mellow mushroom it would be. we sat outside but were impressed with the clean, spacious dining area. our server jody was very good , he was suggestive and patient as we looked over the overwhelming menu choices. the pizza was delishhhhh.... the sandwiches how ever are nothing special. 38 beers on tap, but offer cans of miller lite...definatly my new spot for pizza and a cold one."}
{"text":"Came in for our first visit for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. 
This was a solid 3.5 stars. 
We were seated right away, no wait which was nice. 
Our server was so incredibly happy and friendly. It was quite impressive.

We started with the pretzels appetizer with butter and parmesan. Wow. Those were good. Covered in buttery deliciousness. They are made out of the same dough that the pizzas are made out of. 
For our first foray into the pizza here we got the \"Holy Shiitake\". I loved the crust and most of the flavors on the pizza. The only thing I didn't like was the garlic aioli on the pizza, I didn't think it needed it and the mayo-like sauce gave the pizza a strange mouth feel. But once I scraped that stuff off, it was good! The crust is nice, a little thicker and has a really good chew without being too sweet. 
Even though I think this is a 3.5, I rated a 4 star rather than 3 since I really can't wait to just try a different pizza for this place 'cause I really loved the crust."}
{"text":"Came here with a group.  Everybody had pizza which I did not try but looked pretty good (although I prefer thin crust).  To be a rebel, I ordered a Tempeh Hoagie. OH-MY-LORD!  It was most excellent, I must say.  I wish I had ordered a whole one instead of half.  But I also wish it had had a more interesting side...  The bag of chips was just not doing it for me.  The bread was described as \"French\" and I would be hard pressed to call it that but I actually thought it was good because unlike a real baguette it was easier to bite into.  Dessert menu was not that interesting but when I'm in the area again I would still go back.  Plenty of vegetarian options to make me happy and all served in a fun ambiance."}
{"text":"Alright people so we all come here for the happy hour. Half off apps and alcohol is obviously great. 

However...Mellow would not be my first choice even with the great deals. It is a very okay place to eat!

The atmosphere is fun and it's a good place to go eat and drink with friends but, the service won't be amazing and the food will be pretty good at best.

BB's Rating: No Happy Hour = Crappy Hour"}
{"text":"Too crowded down the street and late for a Gammage production, we stopped in for a bite and were SO pleasantly surprised. The service is attentive and friendly and the place is super clean. Pizzas here are both unusual and mainstream. You can go either way and be happy as can be. The crust on that barbecue chicken pizza was undeniably tasty. Sauce that's not too sweet or salty and cooked perfectly. I can't imagine trying anywhere else when I have a pizza craving. Need to work on that spinach salad though - all spinach and the extras were hard to find. I'll be back though, and I can't wait."}
{"text":"Mellow Mushroom has some seriously good tasting Pizza Crust. Depending on when you go, the restaurant can be a bit noisy. Overall, I usually have a really nice time here. If you like Pesto, I highly recommend getting the Pesto swirl on your pizza. So good!"}
{"text":"1. Service is adequate. Not great mind you, just adequate.
2. Food is tasty. 
3. Prices are stupid. Its pizza and sandwiches folks. Give me a break with some of these prices!
4. If you go, go during happy hour. Then the prices wont bother you.

I have gone a couple times and each time I go, I ask myself, why. I guess Norterra area needs more options."}
{"text":"My wife, brother in-law and I decided to enjoy a great pie and some brew at Mellow Mushroom. The pizza and beer are always good but our outing was made even better by Chris the manager. Her pleasant, cheerful and attentive demeanor was a welcome pleasure in a world that is becoming more and more impersonal. 

We arrived a few minutes before happy hour ended, but we're not seated until after happy hour ended. Chris honored the happy hour offerings because if the wait. She came by are table several times to check on us even though the restaurant was filled to capacity and she was training new servers. I will certainly come back again."}
{"text":"So long time non-yelp user finally having to sign up for this. My wife said that I need to start writing reviews so I can become an elite and she can be my plus one. So here goes on this crappy place.

1. Hostess sitting on host stand looking lazy. If you can't stand for your shift, don't work on
 your feet. This looks trashy.

2. Trashy part #2, the menu that we were given at the bar looked like it had been through Benghazi without additional support.

3. Bartender with a bandana was drinking more than one \"sample\" at the bar. This is 100% illegal according to NC ABC.

4. They messed up the guy next to us order, he wanted his hoagie in a pita and it came on a bun. They were going to correct it but the guy said he'd just got to Duckworths.

Let's just say Marcus Lemonis would have a fit if he walked into this place tonight. What a disgrace to all restaurant establishments. The only reason we sat down was because there weren't any seats at Blackfinn tonight.

We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and pretty good pizza. We ended up here on a Sunday night after finding this open and A LOT of other restaurants with good Yelp reviews closed. The service was great, and the food came out really fast. Highly recommend the portabella mushroom appetizer, super delicious! Would recommend anyone come here:)"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite pizza place. Their buffalo chicken pizza is the best. 

Great service and their selection of local beers is awesome. They have a good happy hour as well. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I'd really like to be able to visit this place more than 2x's a year but it takes about 6 months to get over each bad experience.

The Quick & Dirty:
Good atmosphere, good location, good beer selection, excellent pizza, horrible service.

Server inexperience kills this place, last time we dined there the lack of urgency brought out my inner 10% tipper, which is physically painful to do as a former bartender and server I generally average in the 30-50% range, but I cannot enable that crappy of service.  The previous time we probably waited 10 minutes at a bar table before even as little as being greeted, we got up and went to Duckworth's.

See you guys again in September."}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome, had a Blue Moon with Spinach Dip and it was the best combo EVER! Waitress totally sucked and we were her only table but we weren't starving or in a hurry so it wasn't a huge issue."}
{"text":"Pizza is unique.  Great dough.  Solid beer selection and friendly staff.   
The house pizza is so good (we sin out the bacon for pepperencinis.   Enough four two meals for two!"}
{"text":"Just got around to trying this place. I am not a fan of chains, but we were meeting friends and they suggested it. 

Was greeted by a very friendly crew and asked for table outside. Not much of a patio but good vibe as there is a big bar that opens to the outside so it gives it a bigger feel. 

We were immediately greeted by our server who informed us it was happy hour and what that meant as far as drink deals and appetizers. Beer menu is extensive which is a plus.  

We ordered the drunken funguys, which you would think would be mushrooms, but not at all. They are warm pretzel nuggets with a beer cheese dipping sauce, nothing to rave about but the 3.99 happy hour price can't be beat for about 20 of the little fun \"guys\". 

We ordered the Redskins potato pizza at our server's suggestion. The four of us split a large and we all thought it was one good suggestion. None of us would have ordered it, but all of us said we would order again --it was that good. 

Love the eclectic decor with an almost steam punk ambience. Very fun. 

Again, I'm not a fan of chains, but would probably go back. The staff were super friendly and our server Gretchen was engaging and gave us great suggestions."}
{"text":"Waited at least 45-60 minutes for a pizza - food average - service below average - ambience below average - overall value - poor would not go back"}
{"text":"Really Great Mellow Mushroom. Staff are fantastic especially with kids. Great pizza and kids meals are good value and they have them come out first which is great. On Friday and Saturday's they have a ballon animal guy in who makes creations for tips. Really great way to make a meal out even more fun for kids"}
{"text":"We've been to the Mellow Mushroom in Tempe a few times now and really enjoyed it.  Tonight my wife was really craving something and some how stumbled on this one on our side of town.  She was sold, she had to have it tonight.  

The Pizza at Mellow Mushroom is always fantastic, and this one was no exception.  We had the Thai Pizza.  It has some curried chicken, cucumbers, basil, tomato, some onion and a sweet chili sauce.  It was fantastic.  It was sweet and savory and a little spicey and just all around yummy.  The crust on the pizzas here are always great.  They aren't the super crunchy crust like at  New York style pizza.  They are a little soft, a little chewy and a little crunchy.  All the goodness is there.  We've had several of the Pizza from here and they are always awesome.

We also got a Steak House Salad to split with the pizza and again, it was great.  We substituted some Parmesan cheese for the Blue cheese (I just don't like it) and it was superb.  It was your typical salad with mixed greens and the usual chopped veggies.  But they also added in some corn \"salsa\" and some avocados.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was super tender and delicious.     

The beer selection here is also great.  They have a bunch of local brews (some are seasonal and some are always there).  Our waiter was pretty knowledgeable about the beers (although we've had some that aren't always so knowledgeable) and brought us out a few samples of the ones we were interested in.

The only real reason that I'm not giving this place the 5 stars that it may deserve is the price.  It is a little pricey.  The beers are 6 bucks a pint, the small pizza we got was $12 and the salad was about the same.  So all in all, for the two of us to have a slice of pizza (with 2 left over) and some yummy salad was $50.  If you are willing to spend a couple extra bucks for something fantastic this place is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Always good food but the service is slow.  Would have loved another beer with my pizza.  One of the pies had over cooked crust which we would've returned but it probably will take another hour to get a second pizza back. Highly recommend the management start looking into ways to improve their service."}
{"text":"Best service I've had at this location in awhile, server was \"danny with the fanny\". Service was excellent, I went in for a birthday dinner! And from the time I arrived it was pleasant. I've been in the past and the pizza has been over cooked. This time it was how I've had it at every other location. I will be returning for sure. Thumbs up for the service!"}
{"text":"Great wings with amazing pretzels and very chilled atmosphere.  I come here whenever I have time or am hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"I would really like to give this mellow mushroom a better review, but right now it's maintaining a three out of five stars for issues with freshness and service quality. The atmosphere is fun (like other MMs). The front staff were welcoming immediately so no problem there. But or server, while really friendly, forgot our requests twice in only a short visit. They did fix both of the service errors without hesitation. But it wasn't the mellow, smooth experience I've come to expect at a mellow mushroom. The issue with freshness involved overly chewy dough that lacked flavor that MM usually has. The pizza and it's toppings seemed really dry. Not sure what was going on here but it leaves a lot to be desired. We will come back in hopes of a better experience next time."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going there and I won't be coming back.. I didn't even get to eat the food so that was a bummer.. I went there with my husband and toddler today and it wasn't even busy in there so I figured we'd get our food fast and explore Mill Avenue. We asked to sit outside and there was another small group of people there as well. A few minutes after we were seated the server just barely ordered their drinks, she never greeted us to say she would be a moment, nothing. So I waited.. when she brought their drinks she never looked at our table (we were right next to them, what are we, ghosts?!) and she walked back inside. That ticked me off, so that's when I got my phone out and put the timer on, I told my husband she has five minutes to greet us, something, or we are walking. I got up, looked at her from the window and made direct eye contact and she looked away. She came out, I got excited, she is finally coming over.. nope, goes back to the group right next to us so they can order and she walked right back inside. I was pissed, I told my husband that we should just go, I grabbed our stuff and that is when another group was seated outside... Good luck to them, hopefully they got to eat. We ended up eating at Steak and Shake across the street.. I'd highly recommend going there."}
{"text":"Good: 
excellent pizza dough
Fresh salad

Bad:
Service could be better
No music so much loud noises 
Slow service 

Ugly: 
forgot straws and crayons
Long wait to be seated 
Long wait for food to be served 40 min for pizza is little too long
Staff at kitchen yelled at each other's"}
{"text":"I had just gotten my hair colored purple and then met up with a friend at Mellow. I got there first and spent the five minutes I had alone taking selfies of my new fun purple hair and the lighting was SO GOOD in the bar area. My hair girl was so impressed with my selfies. Thanks Mellow Mushroom for the lighting. ;)"}
{"text":"The bad thing about this place is that it certainly doesn't fit in with my new plant based eating plan. I did have a Greek salad though. LOL However, I think the Muffaletta Bread App and pizza ( that has a crust, by the way, more like a baked pretzel than a pizza) kind of killed it. I did have small servings though. :0)----- I had a great meal with great company and great service! ( thanks Kevin and cute guy with the pony tail) We did a 50 /50 pizza split with a potato mixed pizza and a Greek style. Sorry I forget the names. The pizza was very different and very delish! The subs look fantastic here too. The restaurant is very cool and hip. Lots of room to chat and relax. We went early at 3pm on a Saturday so no crowds at all. Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Not a whole lot in options but the proportions are gigantic! Pretty good food, a little fancy for a pizza place in my opinion though."}
{"text":"I am rating this place a 2 because I have had Mellow Mushroom in Savannah. If I hadn't experienced Savannah's I would possibly rate this location a 3...possibly. The Mellow Mushroom in Savannah is a unique dining experience where as the Mellow Mushroom in Phoenix was just basic eats at a regular ol' run-of-the-mill franchise restaurant. 

We had the gourmet white pizza, spinach artichoke dip and a Greek salad. If Applebee's served pizza this is how it would taste - very commercial. Nothing really stood out. Plus they put sun dried tomatoes on everything which just reminds me of the Broodwich."}
{"text":"Had a better experience at this location than the one on I-17, pizza was much better and was on our table fairly quick. I liked the garlic crust and was much thicker than what we had before. 

Good service and we were able to use a groupon that was valued at $20 that was purchased for $8. The pizza places in AZ are so competitive for quality pizza and this is what I consider middle of the road but, better middle of the road."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times and the food has always been good and I love their beer. The service has always been a downside...but for good food its something I'm willing to work with. After we had left we noticed that they charged our card wrong and we left the card there. We went back in to pick up the credit card and discuss the charge and it went downhill from there.

The manager that we spoke with didn't ask for any identification before handing us the credit card, and didn't even ask for a name. After saying we left our card here they just handed us the card. I find that a bit scary.

But when we were talking to the manager I was so insulted. The manager was extremely unprofessional. He was constantly swearing and before even hearing us out was already saying that we must be in the wrong about what had happened regarding the charge. I don't expect to go in and have someone just take my word for it but I requested the manager to look at the cameras before doing anything because they have cameras everywhere. About 20 minutes into the conversation the manager called the person I was with an a**hole. While I was still standing there talking to him. I get the situation was frustrating for both of us, but for someone who is representing the business as a manager to speak to anyone that way is uncalled for. After that experience I won't be going back, even if I love their food."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good, the service was kind of slow though. I still miss me some New York pizza. If I come here again I'll make sure it's not on a busy night."}
{"text":"The three stars would be about accurate. Overpriced, tiny salad portions and very slow back of the house service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the white pizza and the dough bites with the cheese sauce.  Goes great with a blue moon.   Bartenders were attentive and friendly made for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Team Lunch to this location and we were able to get our order in and food in a reasonable amount of time. I must say the pretzels with the beer sauce was amazing.  The team used it on the pizza crust as well.  We ordered the meat lover equivalent and I loved every piece of it.  I remembered eating at this chain a few years ago and I don't recall it being so good.  Maybe I didn't order the right stuff, but this time they satisfied."}
{"text":"Thought we would give this a try prior reading the Yelp reviews. Fun 60s retro decor, good bar with terrific beer selections on draft and nice staff. I have not yet mentioned pizza. Wife and started by splitting a Brutus salad which was served with a warm sliced portobello mushroom. Very nice and perfect to share.
Anticipated great things for our pizza course. Alas, mediocre crust but with good toppings and hot as hell straight from the oven. If you are looking for a casual dining spot with good service, drinks, and fun atmosphere give MM a try. Just don't go for the pizza."}
{"text":"I made it a point to try every specialty pizza on the menu...and I did! The House Special is an all around good pizza. If you want to make things interesting, get the Mauie Wowie! They have taken it off their menu at this location, but the last time I was in there, they were still able to make it. The crust is a sweet water dough and they also have pretzels made from that dough, so good."}
{"text":"I sent this review through the Mellow Mushroom website as well, and to my amazement, the next morning I had an email from the owner and a voicemail from the general manager. Both expressed their deepest apologies for what happened to my parents at the Tempe location. The owner, Jay, even asked for my parents address so that he might send a formal apology and refund them their bill. I spoke with Drew, the general manager on the phone and he assured me that he had begun retraining that very same day with regards to cross-contamination and food allergies.

It's people like this that restore my faith in the food industry. Thank you so much for your efforts to remedy this situation and prevent future problems. I look forward to one day trying out your restaurant again."}
