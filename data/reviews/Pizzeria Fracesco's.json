{"text":"On a family vacation in Vegas last week we ate at this restaurant and experienced the worst service I think I've every experienced in my life.  We were at the restaurant at opening time in order to make a show a little later that evening and everything moved at snails pace from the moment we arrived.  The real capping moment was when after a very long wait for our food my 6 yr old's food came out incorrect.  There was a complete lack of regard from our waiter and most of the restaurant staff as to this issue and while they did finally bring a replacement there was no urgency and no apology.  In fact the replacement came 15 mins before our show was about to start so my daughter was never fed.  That's 1 3/4 hours to get a pizza.  The only reason I'm not giving it 1 start is my wife liked her food.

Did I mention the point when the waiter poured water on my Dad, or when the wine was delivered but then not opened for 10 minutes...."}
{"text":"Stayed at this hotel. While hanging out at the casino, got hungry and didn't feel like driving out for something to eat especially when we just wanted something small in the meantime before dinnertime. So decided to grab a slice of pizza (a vegetarian combo - olives, spinach, tomato slices and onions). It was a pretty large slice and pretty costly at about $6 with tax but its on the strip and in a hotel casino so it wasn't too bad in that case. In fact, it was worthwhile as the pizza was actually pretty darn good. A bit on the greasy side though but as weird as I am, I get napkins to Hubby and little brother stole a few bites from me too for that reason and they both loved it. I would have taken a picture but we inhaled it before I remembered to do so. Opps. 

They also have quick grab and go sandwiches, salads, caprese salads and fruit cups. They have specials which is $8 for a slice a pizza, garlic bread and a beer which isn't too shabby at all. Place was pretty roomy so not much long wait time. You can eat in also like a cafeteria style place.

Will definitely come back whenever I need a quick bite without having to leave the hotel to get it."}
{"text":"This pizzeria is located inside the Treasure Island Casino and is a nice alternative to the more expensive restaurants located in this area. I mean, it's the Las Vegas strip- of course it's overpriced! The pizza runs about $5-$6.50 per slice and I would say was pretty delicious.  They have pre-made salads as well. You can grab a slice while gambling or on your way to the pool for a snack. Go- Get pizza here."}
{"text":"Quick and cheap, two things that you dont find often in Vegas. Everyone were super nice and smiled. If I stay here again, I'm definitely stopping in again"}
{"text":"Not great, but quick and relatively inexpensive. Got sausage and pepperoni with garlic bread. Food was very unimpressive. Would not come again."}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza. I never have to wait long either and the employees are very friendly. Is it cheap? No.... but your on the Las Vegas strip nothing is.  I use my poker comps here."}
