{"text":"Came here to buy a birthday cake since it was close to where I was going.  The cakes were on special for only $14 for a 7 inch.  I got the cappacino flavored cake. It looks fresh...I hope it tastes good. The other cakes looked okay but not as good as this one. All the Chinese buns in the store were really fresh as they kept on coming out from the kitchen.  The employees were not too friendly and there was definitely a language barrier. Other than that, the place does the trick for a Chinese bakery."}
{"text":"stay AWAY from this place, I overheard the owner of this place telling his employees to use up the rotten fruits and expired bubble tea powder first. What's even more shocking was my friend said she saw employees trying to get rid a cockroach inside the kitchen while we were waiting for our drinks *vomits*. We threw away the drinks as soon as we left the shop."}
{"text":"Bakery in Agincourt mall. You cant walk anywhere near this place without being able to smell the delicious aroma of the bread and pastries they make here.  They have specials on their bakery items after 5pm and are tax free, and they have a selection of cakes ranging from around $12-16 for a 7\" cake. They also sell bubble tea which isn't that great but the ones that they have on special each day are pretty cheap so it's worth a try if you're craving ~"}
{"text":"Located inside Agincourt mall, they have a good selection of pastries/ and drinks (coffee/ tea/ bubble tea - where there is a daily special offering).  The selection of pastries is OK and taste is quite acceptable for the price point (comparing apples to apples here, not the 1.20 per pastry places).  With their long going 6 buns special, the selection and quality is very nice.  You can always throw them into the fridge and give it a quick 20/second warm up the next day for that fresh out of oven feel.  There are a few locations, and only the one DT charges more for the same bun special"}
{"text":"The place is kind of dirty, and the staff are so rude. The place caught my attention just because they had a 8 for $10 promotion going on, but you can literally find something similar with much better service somewhere else"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in the coconut buns. All coconut buns I have had at other bakeries actually have coconut on the inside, but this one did not. Also, the price could be more reasonable. You can get the same type of buns for 3 for $1 downtown. But at least the buns are fresh."}
{"text":"Kin Kin bubble Tea Bakery at Agincourt Mall is pretty much the only reason why this mall is still open. They have a wide variety of buns, pastries and cookies for a very cheap and affordable price and they are always baked fresh as you can see that they keep coming out of the oven. There is always a special discount for 6 buns for $5 which is very cheap. Their slushes and smoothies are also freshly made with real fruit and they taste so amazing and refreshing! I always come here to order one after school. As well, they have really affordable and cute looking cakes which taste pretty good for the price you get. Really, I give this place a 5 out of 5."}
