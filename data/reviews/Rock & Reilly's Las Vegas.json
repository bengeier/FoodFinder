{"text":"Location close to Marriott Grand Chateau for breakfast. Quinoa egg breakfast and cinnamon French toast were both good."}
{"text":"Just walked in off the strip. Came with the wife to catch the last part of the game. Ordered two bloody Marys. Bill came back for $30. $15 dollar Bloody Mary!We had to ask for olives, didn't come with limes or a salted rim. No garnishes and it was the house vodka. And I was worried about the casino ripping me off. $15 dollars for Bloody Mary mix and house vodka. It seems excessive. Won't be back. I will say that the bartender was nice and very apologetic when we inquired about the price."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience ever for breakfast on 4/29/17.  I was embarrassed. I invited my son's girlfriend and her parents who also happened to be in Las Vegas to meet us for breakfast.  Should have gotten up and left after it took the wait staff 12-15 minutes to come to the table and offer us water.  Finally they took our order.   I was on the patio and went inside to look around and the place was less than a Â¼ full.  After 45 minutes I asked about our order and they said the kitchen was backed up but it would be out shortly.  I have no idea what the problem was, but they finally got our food to us 1 hour and 10 minutes after we ordered.  The food was good, but the service was horrible.  Would never recommend you go there unless you have a ton of time on your hands and you want to sit and watch the people!"}
{"text":"Was walking down the strip and decided to check this place out. I was pleasantly surprised not only bye the food but also how attentive and nice my server Glivell was. The corn beef hash was solid and the tomato soup was one of the best I've had. You can't go wrong with some good food and cold beer so would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I have mixed reviews.. I passed this spot and really had to try it out. Come to find out the food isnt that great. Would i go back? Yes! because the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I had a quinoa salad that was huge for the price I paid for it. We sat on the patio so we got to watch the people walk by. The service was excellent"}
{"text":"Great after hours place. Loved the nachos. Dom the bartender was a lot of fun. His blow jobs are the best!"}
{"text":"Drinks were just okay and food was medicore. It was a convenient location so I went here. I wouldn't recommend, there are better places on the strip.   My salad was super dry and the server didn't come back and ask me if I wanted a drink.   The portions are insanely large."}
{"text":"Being an Irishman who is proud of his irish heritage,  I'm glad to say this place not only impressed me, but if me and my wife move here as we have been talking about, we will be back often.  The service is great, as we walked in we were greeted friendly by the staff who asked us bar or booth. We opted for bar and were immediately greeted by the bar tender, a woman named katie. As we are not from here, we decided to ask what she thought best, took her options, and were so far from being disappointed. I got an old fashion and a straight shot of their house made whiskey, while my wife got something called a bubble bath. We both were pleased with our drinks.   As far as food goes, we got mozzarella sticks for an appetizer,  she got the irish nachos (I had to help her lol) and I got my old irish favorite ( bangers and mash).   The food was superb, and wonderful delicous. This is not bar food. This is food in a bar. Along with great drinks and a wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place has a nice Irish entourage to it and it had a live musician playing which was surprisingly good playing a nice mix of evergreens in the countryrock realm. We were seated but it took a while to be served. Once the waitress found our table we ordered two burgers and beers. We had the o'reilly burgers which was OK. The salad was nice too, but I'd expect fries to be served also, but I guess I missed the side-dish paragraph on the menu. All in all a good experience, they have a varied menu including some traditional Irish dishes. 3,5 stars (between A-OK and Yay, I'm a fan)"}
{"text":"After initially having a misunderstanding about what was included and what wasn't included in my drinking package... The staff has been amazing!! The manager has continued to check in on us, and our waitress/bartender Katie has by far been better than any other I have ever had. When visiting Las Vegas one may not think to come to Rock and Reilly's but if you don't you are definately missing an amazing spot, to drink, laugh, eat and watch sports!!"}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday morning around 8:00a for breakfast. I imagine that Saturday Vegas mornings on the strip are always a bit more low key... This place was quiet (aside from the punk music playing on the speakers) and we were sat right as we walked in.  I opted for the Irish Breakfast, sausages, eggs, tomato, toast, mushrooms, and bacon. The bacon was superb, cooked nice and crispy, super thick too. The eggs were spot on too. The sausage was delicious and I ate both pieces. The tomato, was a bit under ripe and still had the hard green stem/core in/on it, which was annoying to cut around, but it was charred just a little, and not quite warm enough. The toast came without butter, and none was on the table (or too salt and pepper come to think of it).  But we were hungry and it hit the spot.  It was actually really quite tasty and in addition to the free draught beer for checking in on Yelp (FTW!) the servers were nice and always checking on us.  The price was good too, maybe the best I paid for anything all week, at around $20 for breakfast and coffee I'd come here again."}
{"text":"So we decided to go to an Irish Pub on St Patty's (not at all cliched!). Well surprisingly we weren't the only ones thinking the same thing! So it was crowded but that's too be expected. We went to other Irish Pubs that wanted to charge money just to get into the bar! Well Rock and Reilly's welcomed is in no problem!  The best part was they had the same menu as usual besides the all you can drink wristband. The beer process were fair and you know I had to get the corned beef hash!  Even the food was tasty! I was plenty surprised at how much I enjoyed the place. The key code to get into the restrooms was a little weird though!"}
{"text":"4/11/18 8pm'ish:          The server (brunette) had no clue that her restaurant offered a free beer when you check in on Yelp. She also had no clue about a \"fries or salad\" option for $2.50 that is clearly on the menu. Maybe she's new to R&R idk. We ordered the fried broccolini to start and it literally is fried burnt. The broccoli heads were black and completely burnt crispy, the stems were really good and so was the flavored glaze. I had their \"nationally award winning\" Grill Cheese and Tomato Bisque soup. The sandwich was big and really good with plenty of cheese, the tomato bisque was in a serving size that seemed a bit less than a full cup even, I wanted a whole bowl with my award winning grill cheese. The soup was also good flavored but literally a thick beverage..... no hints of tomato pieces or any substance at all but that's just my preference ,  maybe thats how they want it served.  She had a veggie burger that looked like it would choke you as it was served so dry but she really liked it so there ya go. She also liked the pretzel for desert. Even though we literally were the only people dining inside their restaurant because their patio was where people were choosing to sit it seemed like I was looking out for the server quite often as if they were much busier......... Their little side salads are really good too."}
{"text":"Here for the weekend stopped on Friday night to check it out and I wasn't disappointed so I came back for Saturday dinner. Got to try the mozzarella sticks, chicken skewers and fish and chips all of which were fresh at the time of arrival and tasted very well. The prices are affordable and their 2 for 12dlls on Guinness is a sweet deal. The dinner for 2 with our beer came out to about 45 dlls. We did happy hour which includes 2 for 1 appetizers. Would recommend for a sit  in good dinner on a budget right on the strip. Will def come back in future Vegas visits"}
{"text":"We randomly ended up at this gem! The drinks, food, and service were amazing. We asked Brad for his favorites and we got the best choice. I loved it so much I bough a shirt!! You have to visit. You will not be sorry!!!"}
{"text":"You've GOT to be kidding! $22 for 2 beers!! Too many other places for this. The staff was rude- thousands of bars in vegas- SKIP THIS ONE!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast. Whitney served us. She was awesome! Our French toast with berries was delicious and the eggs bacon and potatoes just right! The fresh morning air and enjoying the view up the strip was a pleasure.   Thank you Whitney!  We bless you!"}
{"text":"Would come back again, we were in Las Vegas walking down the strip and came across this place. Irish bar restaurant with rock music theme. Food was good, service was good. We sat outside and enjoyed a nice lunch."}
{"text":"I follow Rock Reilly's on instagram and they're food always looked delicious. O convinced a co worker to go after work since Vegas locals get 50% off on Mondays !!!! What a great deal since everywhere park they charge us.. anyways.. I ordered the mac and cheese with chicken, and all I have to say is.... it was worth every penny, minute wasted. My friend ordered chicken Nachos, she did ask to please not add Onion but they still added onion to her plate. She didn't want to be that bitch that wastes food all because of onion so she pushed them aside we know things happen... but said her Nachos were ok, she will next time order something different. After we ate, we decided to play some Beer pong! How awesome is it to eat and play!!!!!!  We had so much fun it was so inexpensive but The only reason why i don't rate this place a 5 star is because they weren't crazy busy, but still felt so ignored. Almost felt like they didn't want to take care of us. This place has great potential and the environment is great, I would have just more attentive waiters. Other than that it was great! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Server never came to our table even once. We had to flag the hostess down for water. Waited longer still no server so we again asked the hostess if someone was coming to take our order. The hostess put the order in for us and both meals came out wrong. Forget drink refills. They weren't what we even ordered. This place is the worst in all of Vegas. Low quality & Terrible service. Staff all look like they are on drugs"}
{"text":"Stopped over twice for a beer and watch the soccer. Staff are extremely helpful and polite, prices are way  Below the average for Vegas."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is my new favorite bar. Good tunes. Fun crowd. Rad bartenders. Oh, and did I mention the bartender, Vinny, makes the best Bloody Mary I've had in any other bar out here. It's a great place to come and meet people and have a good time. I'm super in love. I had the best time, and in fact I'm going back tonight."}
{"text":"Back for a 3rd time in 3 days! This place is so Bomb! Everything we have order has been amazing. We've had Corned Beef and Cabbage, Fish and Chips, Irish Nachos, and Grilled Cheese with Tomato Soup. I would order any of them again. The servers are all friendly and helpful, even if it's not their table. Check them out. Right on the Vegas Strip"}
{"text":"This is a very cool little pub right on the strip. It has a great list of whisky and innovative cocktails to compliment a menu of delicious, Irish inspired dishes. Definitely enjoy the patio if there is room."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch - liquid and otherwise - on a Saturday. Super attentive and friendly staff. Great food. Delicious menu of both good bar bites and healthier options. Loved the cheeseburger spring rolls. They have great whiskey and beer selections and fun flights. We sat at a high top along the strip which added to our people watching experience. Whatever management is doing here, keep it up!  Great food and drinks are available all over Las Vegas. To find an affordable combination of these AND great service is rare!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was here on vacation and this place was amazing! Great good and drinks. The tv set up is awesome if you are watching a game. The staff was really friendly and attentive. Definitely a great Irish pub. I would recommend stopping in if you are walking the strip"}
{"text":"Stopped there because it was one of the few sit down restaurants open in the area.  It was after midnight and the hubby and I were hungry and tired.  We asked if they were still serving food. A very nice brunette waitress said we can seat ourselves and someone would bring us menus.   We sat for more than 10 minutes before I walked up to the bar and asked id we could get service.  The brunette waitress said she would bring us menus.  A male employee came over and dropped off menus and asked if we wanted water. We said yes.  We waited and he never returned with water. A different person took our order. Then another man walked up to our table after we ordered to confirm our order. I thought perhaps they were going to comp us something for the horrible service we received.  My husband said afterwards that they wanted to know what we ordered so they they knew which food to spit on.  Food was not anything to write home about ... especially for $60 plus tip."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited on the graveyard shift, we both ordered the grilled cheese and soup... All I can say is... That meal made me feel like I had been waiting for it all day... Easily the best meal at had up to that point on our trip!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!  Great food. Great drinks!  And live music!!!  I had Irish Nachos and Fish tacos.  Sit outside and people watch and enjoy Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came here for the Super Bowl: did some research before hand and decided $100 a person for open bar and a guaranteed seat was a good deal. Spoke to many staff members before hand, including a manager, and determined you didn't need to purchase this package to sit and watch the game. We made a reservation (again, $100 a person) for three of us to get a wristband. Close to halfway through the game, my mom, who wasn't planning on ordering more than one drink, came to sit with us and hang out (again, we had confirmed this was ok). The waitress came by, and my mom asked to order a drink, but she said you must spend $75 if you didn't have a \"reservation\". Fine, no problem, she'll just sit and hang out. Then about 5 minutes after that, our waitress came back with her manager and told my mom she needed to leave because she wasn't going to spend the $75. No warning, no nothing, had clearly just gone and told on us to her manager. It was never communicated to us that spending this $75 was mandatory, more so just seemed like something that needed to be done if you were going to order something without having purchasing a wristband. *Not to mention, there were tons of open tables in this place, and the three of us with wristbands were sitting at a 4 person table, so her sitting with us was not losing this place any money* When we asked a manger about it, they kept saying \"the company makes us do it\" ( the company mind you, was not present and would have no idea she was sitting with us). Overall, there was just horrible communication and no common sense amongst the staff, and for people paying $300+, we should've been treated better. Basically, we should've had the 4 of us just show up and meet the $75 minimum per person, instead of having 3 of us paying $100. It would've come out to the same total price, and we could've all sat together instead of having my mom rudely kicked out. I get that it's Vegas and they want to make money, but this option was never suggested to us. They weren't willing to work with us at all, and honestly made our Super Bowl more unpleasant than it needed to be. Not to mention their TVs went out in the middle of the game so we couldn't even watch the whole thing. And they turned the sound off during the halftime show to conduct a raffle, so we missed a large portion of that as well. I'm typically not a complainer, and to be honest the food and drinks were good, I just feel like all of these issues could've been completely avoided."}
{"text":"The food was great! Irish nachos & a couple of beers. It's a Sunday, a bit busy nothing to crazy.  1 bartender who waited on everyone. They have a lot of service staff bussers & one barback.  Maribeth was the server / bartender and was very nice.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Cool little spot right on the strip. My brother had the tomato soup and said it's one of the best he's ever had. I had the Irish nachos with corned beef. A little different because it was potato chips and not tortilla chips but they seemed to be cooked in-house so that was an added bonus."}
{"text":"Went here for the Irish grilled cheddar cheese & tomato soup, and no I was not disappointed at all. The best grilled cheese I've ever eaten in my 40 years of life, seriously"}
{"text":"Corn beef slider was great, but the other two were awful.turkey and wee beef were both soggy..I was alone so  the service sucked."}
{"text":"Out of 7 meals only one came out that was half way decent. We ordered a special cocktail drink and it came out different than described, when we ask about why it came out different the waitress she said they were out of the ingredients when we said that we did not want it then she had an attitude.  We ordered the chicken quesadilla it came out with no chicken, all other dishes came out with no flavor. When we informed the manager he seemed to have a I don't give a fuck attitude and said well I will take off the quesadilla and take care of all your drinks. When we got the bill we still had drinks on it and it was still over $100 I would not recommend this place"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but the prices are high for drinking a few beers during the middle of the day.  When Bud Light is $7 and anything resembling an interesting beer is $10 I am going to have to pass.  Get some drink specials!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burger for $16. The free draft is a PBR, total bait and switch. Not sure what else to say, it appears that yelp now requires a lengthy wordcount to get a point across that can be said in two sentences."}
{"text":"Apparently the free draft beer offer on yelp with a check in is only PBR. Strange though, the offer says \"free draft beer\", not free PBR. No fine print either. If it's PBR just say so, don't try and be deceptive about it. As a local will not be returning. Food is average. Ri Ra at Mandalay is better for locals with their 40% off on Fridays."}
{"text":"Don't go here for the food. Loved the photos and descriptions on the outside of the building and came back later after we checked yelp and saw that they had five stars wow it was a big disappointment. Poorly trained waitress bungled and kept bungling our order and then was very late with the food. No apologies, no comps or discounts. Weird mellow acoustic act...at a rock bar? Ugh."}
{"text":"Came here looking for shots after exploring the strip. Asked for a Washington apple, cant make it. Asked for a baby Guinness, cant make it. Charged me 30 bucks for a pitcher of hard cider. Definitely survives being in business because of location not because of their empty bar, overpriced and not-too-good of a selection of alcohol and the very rude and very snotty bartenders. I do not recommend this place"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! Best Grill Cheese and Tomato Soup hands down. We also had a sex on the beach, corn beef and cabbage and the corn beef hash! Definitely worth it! We used the Groupon special. Our waitress Ally was a true sweetheart!"}
{"text":"Damn this place rocks with good live music, good food and a perfect spot for people watching right on the strip"}
{"text":"Vegans beware! My bf and I were walking around looking for a lunch spot and noticed that the menu outside stated they offered a vegan burger. I was, of course, excited to try it! When the burger came out, I cut into it and immediately noticed a string of cheese coming off my knife. I showed my bf and he tried a bite (he's not vegan) and confirmed it was cheese. Our server (can't remember his name) was SO great and understanding. He went back to check with the chef about the ingredients. He told me that the chef said the vegan burger was a gardenburger patty made of tofu and rice and that there is no cheese in it. Unfortunately I didn't believe him and it DEFINITELY had cheese.  So I sent it back and just ended up getting a veggie wrap. Like I said, our server was wonderful and felt terrible and took 20% off the bill. However the chefs at this restaurant need to understand what vegan means vs.  what vegetarian means. And do not market a VEGAN burger when it clearly isn't one! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was decent at best, service was terrible drinks were the worst. We all waited for about 20min never got napkins or silverware our food just sat. The server then blamed it on the expo on not bringing us anything. Place just sucks. Don't come here unless your looking for a bad time."}
{"text":"Wouldn't know how the food was because the bartender argued with me over a beer they had on tap. Even if I had been wrong, which I wasn't, what a terrible experience. Cursing and yelling at me across the bar like a juiced up child. Terribly unprofessional. If he worked in my bar he'd be fired for that. So no real review on the food. Only the unprofessional bar staff."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS. This bar is empty and this bartender won't serve us because he's too busy flirting."}
{"text":"Great clean pub food with a light options menu. Excellent service. Our server Melissa was perfect. We happened to ask if the bar carried absinthe and were pleasantly surprised to find they had a bottle of St. George. The bartender served it up well, even though we had to talk him through it a bit. Atmosphere was a nice break from the club feel of most places in Vegas, with music tending toward alt rock."}
{"text":"Great beer on draft and friendly staff will be back... tried the sliders pretty. Awesome deal. They got me drunk with the open bar"}
{"text":"I do not recommend this place.   When we walk in, the busser stares at us for second and grabs the bartender. Those are the only two working front of the house (which is fair, it was 3 in the morning). We're seated at the bar and the bartender gives us menus and gets our drinks. The menu prices are outrageous. $9 for tater tots. $12 for mozzarella sticks. I ordered the $14.50 grilled cheese and soup. My friends ordered the 3 sliders for $16. The sliders are literally just Hawaiian rolls with meat in between. No lettuce, tomato, just a little bit of sauce. My grilled cheese had pickles in it, something I'd never seen, and it wasn't bad, but it was so simple. The sign outside the restaurant says that they have the best grilled cheeses! The soup even tasted like it was from a box. Almost forgot to mention that we waited 35 minutes for our food. We were the only people at the restaurant, no exaggeration. I could've gone back there and made 6 sliders and a grilled cheese a lot quicker.  I was so excited for this place to open, and I was so so disappointed. I HIGHLY recommend to not come here. It'll save you a ton of money."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back to our resort around 10pm...  last stop before our 6am fight home.   Ordered a Bloody Mary, Sex on the Beach, and an Irish Coffee.  Received amazingly special treatment from beginning to end!!  Shout out to hostess/ server Jordann & bar manager Bradley, both went above & beyond to make our visit wonderful.    Will definitely keep this spot bookmarked for our next trip so we can try their food."}
{"text":"The morning crew is the ABSOLUTE BEST EVER! Total dream team! Would recommend to anyone. The servers and bar staff were so positive and happy to be there! 10/10 BEST PLACE EVER"}
{"text":"Back again for the second time ever Alisha  was our server she was wonderful Bradley the bartender manager dude super Duper cool this is definitely my new Monday night spot as it's half price everything on the menu with the local ID that's right people I repeat half price off everything food and drinks with a local ID on Mondays all day all night"}
{"text":"This is the place to be! The locations in LA are great, and this one is too!!! GET THE IRISH NACHOS!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, our server Glivell was really attentive, helpful and knowledgeable when we asked about a few items on the menu making it easier for us to order. Food was great, served in big portions, and mixed drinks tasted greatas well. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decent new place on the strip. We had the Irish nachos and they were fantastic. Staff was friendly as well.  I enjoyed it very much.  Only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there are some seriously off the chain places to eat on the strip. But they have off the chain prices as well. This place is a bargain for the quality of its food.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Breakfast all day at this Irish pub near MGM & Tge Polo Towers.  Very large Irish pub with a ton of Irish beer on tap as well as a full bar and food menu.  Reasonable food prices and great service.  I had the 3 eggs and bacon, and it came with toast, potatoes, fresh fruit, and bacon.  Tons of food for $12.  Opens early (I went at 7am), so whether you're starting party early or just looking for an early (or late!) bite, this is a great stop..."}
{"text":"This place has the best freaking food!  The cheese that comes with the [pretzel] makes me wanna take a gallon home (to say the least), the sliders were the BOMB. I wish I had more of appetite after my hangover because I likely would have eaten the whole menu and would have loved it I'm sure of it"}
{"text":"Wait staff was great! Drinks were not! For the price, the drinks could have been much better. I ordered 3 different drinks and while two were ok, one was horrible. Same for my husband! It's also pretty obnoxious that the staff is yelling at you to come in. I get promoting but having four people covering about 30 feet of space was too much."}
{"text":"For a Vegas trip, I snagged the $20 worth of food and drinks Groupon (list price $14 but I paid around $10 with additional discount).   We used this as a quick respite when the walking became a bit much - and it worked fine for that purpose.    Middle of the afternoon, it was nearly empty - but I get the sense this place is rocking later in the evening.    But with it being that empty, service was painfully slow.  We didn't have silverware or napkins and couldn't get anyone's attention.   And the bathrooms require a code and trying to flag anyone down to get that information was not easy.    Still, a couple of drinks and 2 big pretzels ($9 each - served with ale mustard and cheese sauce) provided enough sustenance to get back to the sightseeing.  And some of the signage is actually funny - a veritable ode to over-imbibing.    Which is what I suspect Rock & Reilly's is REALLY all about."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a beautiful day and there was no one inside. The place was not busy at all and the service was sooooooo slow. Our waitress barely checked on us and didn't have a great personality for being a server. When our food finally did arrive, it was very good but took way too long. There were 5 of us at the table and the server never asked how we were splitting the check and brought it all on one and we had to have her split it. In the time that we were there, there were 3 tables that were seated and ended up leaving before they were waited on because it took too long. Don't go there if you want to eat in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Pros: (1) Iconic place (2) cool gear for purchase (3) food is pretty good (4) patio seating, good for people watching  Cons: (1) waitress didn't know the menu At ALL! (2) super expensive (3) slow service (4) indoor seating is boring and dark (5) out of every shirt that I wanted to purchase  Going back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Getting my head start on St Patty's day and what better way then heading to an Irish Pub. The location is pretty good, you can definitely walk around and get the Las Vegas Strip nostalgic feel. I definitely enjoyed walking around afterwards and people watching.   This Pub has the best Irish Nacho's I've eaten. The Cheese was the best part, it had a delicious taste and savory feeling. I definitely would of been fine with just the cheese and toppings, but at last I love potatoes too much.  So I would definitely recommend the Irish Nachos they'll definitely satisfy the beast within, best part is It pairs well with beer. I also like that you can park right near the location and pay $$, but you can get a refund if you bring your receipt. Definitely worth heading over and checking it out.  I definitely will be back for more food and drinks- hopefully with more friends so we can play some of the games, or watch the game on the screen and share some drinks. Awesome hangout! Awesome Foods! Awesome Service!  I gave 4 stars for now, and once..."}
{"text":"Loved this place and will absolutely be back! Everyone was helpful and friendly in a low-key way. We sat on the patio and then moved further inward into the shade with absolutely no problems at all. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful and her recommendation of the grilled cheese with jalapeÃ±os was amazing! And the beer was great too! Loved this place! Casual atmosphere, great people watching, great food, friendly staff. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Literally 2 stars cause earlier me and my girlfriend came here, lady behind the bar was cool but did not know how to make the drinks, asked us about 3-4 times what drink I wanted. But she made the drinks well and was very helpful until we finally left. Later me and my girlfriend come back after a movie and going to the hotel to get sweaters, soon enough it's a guy behind the bar, dude is pretty good at conversation, but Jesus I spent 49.80$ on two drinks and appetizers. The dude even got the wrong drink. It wasn't even strong and tasted awful (the spicy slapper?) I ordered the Irish southie. At least the girl from earlier asked like 4 times to get it right. Also for some reason they don't know how to make the drinks? They looked at their menus constantly to get it right. It even looked like they happen to be training and left the guy alone? Worst service literally need at least 2 bar tenders."}
{"text":"I read some complaints about the service, so I wanted to say specifically that we had no issues with service. We came in on Thursday around 1:30. It wasn't crowded but there were a few people. Allie was super sweet and attentive- and the Reilly's Rum Drank she made for me was outstanding! Irish nachos with corned beef were yummy!"}
{"text":"Great night. We were a group of 27 and had a great dinner. Alicia and Adrian were a amazing as was all the staff.  Very accommodating and really excellent service by all. That alone is worth 5 stars.  What did we not eat. Loved the American burger, Irish nachos with corned beef, fish and chips, tater tots, corned beef and cabbage, soup and grilled cheese and the list goes on.  Would be a great place to eat on patio overlooking strip but too warm to enjoy that tonight with temps in low 100s. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Our wonderful bartender Katie helped used decide what beer to have. Great bar. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great music from the 80s nice beer never ask for food discounting no flavor no salt or pepper at the table I had the steak the top sauce the worst so sad"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Maybe because we went late night the food has horrible but this place DID NOT live up to the hype. The Irish nachos had way to much gloooy cheese and the grilled cheese that is supposedly rated top 10 in America was only toasted completely on one side and i have  definitely made my kids way better. The tomato bisque that accompanied the sandwich was definitely not prepared in house. It tasted exactly like the bisque I buy from Safeway. The chicken on the chicken Cobb had absolutely NO flavor. Would not recommend to come here AT ALL!!"}
{"text":"Ok. This is the best place on the Strip eats 24 hours. Food is best I have had in decades in Vegas. Got that? Not since they started charging for parking or paying 6 to 5 on Blackjack. Best since they built the Mirage. Juicy thick burgers with thick bacon. Also, a bacon bit and cheese six-egg omelette smashed down until it fit into a tortilla to be called a breakfast burrito. Bar keeps will tell you straight up get a bottle of wine if you're gonna have 4 glasses (girlfriend likes wine).   Downside: service can be a bit slow (not bad, slow). Hard to staff the rushes they get given the location. So, if a bunch of Brits just off the plane are in at 9 am, don't order a 5 liquor drink. Keep it simple."}
{"text":"It's a nice place.  The reilly Burger was the only AMAZING thing we ordered (in my opinion). The chicken skewers had no flavor and it felt like I was eating gristle on some pieces is chicken. The chicken sandwich I had was ok.... Loved the spice on it. Great atmosphere as far as a hang out bar.  I'd probably go back and try other things on the menu hoping to have a good food experience."}
{"text":"Horrible.. the food was tasteless and the manager was snarky and worthless.  The place has potential with new management. Not usually a complainer as I give grace for bad days. However, honestly if our criticism was taken gracefully the review would be quite different... many other options on the strip."}
{"text":"Worst food ever!! The food took forever to come out.   DO NOT EVEN WASTE YOUR TIME!  The chicken wings tasted like fish! The chicken quesadilla did NOT have any chicken, the chicken salad was wilted, and the fish and chips was tasteless.   We tried to tell the so called manager, but he was a jerk about the whole experience.  As a chef and and food critic I wanted to give them a chance but the manager's attitude was displeasing."}
{"text":"It was pretty quiet when we walked in around 11.00pm Saturday evening but the vibe was nice and chill, the air conditioning was lifesaving and the staff were super call. Definitely more relaxed than the one on Sunset Blvd in Los Angeles and hanging at the bar was a nice change of pace from the craziness of the strip.  Ordered a Celtic Makeover cocktail which was perfectly mixed and really hit the spot. Also shared the Irish Nachos which were miles ahead of the crappy nachos we ordered at Tacos & Tequila earlier in the evening. Loved the Kettle Chips instead of Tortilla chips! Definitely a fan and will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick breakfast & this was close by the hotel I was staying at. 10am on a Saturday morning it was not that busy. Got seated right away. Service was quick. Ordered eggs, potatoes & fruit. Food was good enough for quick breakie."}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING!! My husband and I went there, looked like a really neat and unique place to eat on the strip, so we figured we'd give it a try. TERRIBLE IDEA! We shared the Irish nachos, the cheese was really salty, they were cold, and the steak was dried up. Personally, the nachos weren't worth $22 for the quality. Not only did the food suck, the service was just as terrible. I finished both of my drinks, my husband finished both of his before we even got offered a refill on either; good thing we both ordered two drinks from the start. All around, terrible place to go, trust me there are better on the strip for a better price. Try Tilted Kilt at the Linq if you're looking for an Irish pub!"}
{"text":"Good beer selection and great outdoor seating right on the strip. Fantastic for people watching. Misters keep the temperature down. Had the Ruben and a salad that were very solid."}
{"text":"It was mine and my husbands first time in Vegas and we didnt know where to eat so we were walking and they had a great live band playing so we decided to try it and we both ordered burgers i got a regular burger and my husband got a turkey burger and its been 2 weeks and he still regrets not going back for another he swears it was the best turkey burger he has ever had!! So when we go again this will be a must go!"}
{"text":"Awesome pub on the Strip!! Great prices for the strip! Good looking staff and management was on point! Live music was free and pretty good!"}
{"text":"The bar tender with the beard and tattoos was a sarcastic asshole who talk shot the whole time. He was such a dick. We stood at the bar for over ten minute looking for help just for him to be rude."}
{"text":"Only stopped in for drinks while walking from the Luxor to Bally's. Long walk and a drink stop and football update is good. Very friendly staff. We sat at the bar and had interactions with 3 people behind the bar and they all were very attentive to customers and other servers.  You can do beer flights and whiskey flights. The Whiskey flights are pre determined, you can't just pick any 4 whiskey's. If you would like to try different whiskey's this is a cool idea.  They have a number of signature drinks but I'm not sure the bartenders know how to make them correctly. Mine called for basil and an orange twist. I got an orange slice floating on top with a piece of basil. Well there is no flavor of basil or orange in the drink. On the 2nd drink I sunk them both to the bottom of the glass and used 2 swizzle straws to do a posthumous muddling and the drink tasted more complete."}
{"text":"To start off... I think I love this place.  My friend and I came here for lunch before we start our day.    Service: awesome! Friendly staff!  Food: pretty tasty! (I had a Caesar salad with chicken.  The chicken was cooked to perfection)  Environment: the restaurant is clean, comfy seating, cool music.  Staff: hmm... Beautiful. Clearly they understand the winning success of hiring a beautiful team (of course they need to work hard as well)... Certainly that increase my appetite lol.  The ladies are pretty including my waitress, Lexi which super attentive.   But hold the mic, the hot guy who ran our food and the sexy manager in the green tee... I will come back just for that lmao.   But serious, all jokes aside, swing by and grab a drink and good food while you are in Vegas.    Kudos team.  Keep up the sexiness (and good work lol)"}
{"text":"Service was terrible, sat there for 20mins before being helped. Food was pretty solid."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast with the quinoa and avocado with eggs. Great place for early morning something different but healthy."}
{"text":"Awesome place the manGer is fun and Alisha is amazing. We love being the Monday crowed do you know locals on Monday are half price. Is this a deal. Great burger fun tines"}
