{"text":"Just moved to the area and I was looking for my local spot and I think I found it. Great ambiance, TVs at every table, great personal service and I haven't even got to the food. The pizza here has to be the best I have had. A creative menu with fresh, made to order pizzas. My fave is the Thai chicken pizza. Gelato is also delicious! They recently had a pumpkin pie gelato for the holidays and it tastes exactly like homemade pumpkin pie. Overall this place definitely deserves a 5 star and I am so glad I found my new local spot!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!! I finally got around to trying their food and i have to say I was not disappointed. Fire it Up! has such a great atmosphere. They have t.v.'s at every table so the place keeps you entertained whether your alone or you bring your kids along. When i stopped by the owners were in and they were very personal with their customers ( not like other places where the owners just come in for the deposit and leave). The pizza was delicious, its thin crust so I don't feel like i just packed on ten pounds. The pizza is definitely not what you find at a chain... its so much better because they have  a lot more options when it comes to pizza. I ordered their Thai chicken pizza, i highly recommend it, the sauce they used was to die for! The pizza was the perfect size, just enough to fill you up. Everything tasted fresh and i didn't have to wait too long. I will definitely be back when my craving hits!"}
{"text":"I was eager to try this restaurant since as it advertises it is a small local business rather than a chain.  I have to admit I have had much better, even from the chains.  The chicken wings were horrible, they were fatty,  slimy and entirely unappetizing.  The pizza tasted for lack of a better word stale.  It was almost as if they had made it way in advance and simply reheated it.  Overall I was extremely disappointed and would probably not eat here again."}
{"text":"It was a random Thursday night and I wanted something quick and something satisfying. I drove around and found this place and it looked promising. The atmosphere looked great, the place looked clean and It looked like a decent spot to have some pizza. They also had flat screen tv's at every booth with direct tv which is kinda cool. 

The first impression was great. The place looks well maintained and the staff is pretty friendly. I looked around their menu a bit and was kinda bummed they didn't offer pizza by the slice. Granted, it does say gourmet pizza, so perhaps that is why they don't offer it by the slice. After much deliberation, I decided to go with a small 4 cheese pizza and a small order of buffalo wings and a small drink. 

After getting my drink, I sat down and waited for my food. When my wings arrived, I knew I was in for extreme food disappointment. First off, they served the wings on a cardboard disc with parchment paper. Really? I know businesses are hurting, but what the hell? Secondly the wings were just sub standard tasteless prepackaged Tyson buffalo wings from Walmart, or it just tasted and looked like them. You call yourself gourmet pizza restaurant and you serve prepackaged wings? C'mon guys.

I really really hoped that their pizza would taste better, but I was so wrong. The pizza was once again served on a cardboard disc. GOURMET PIZZA ON A CARDBOARD DISC!? SERIOUSLY, C'MON! Even a hole in the wall restaurant serves food on a plate! Their pizza was tasteless and just plain disgusting. I don't know where these people learned how to make pizza. 

Yes, the place looks nice and decked out with flat screens, but their food is just bad. They should have invested the money they put into their TV's into learning how to make pizza.

These are the things that should be changed if they want customers coming back for their food.

1. Wings. STOP SERVING PREPACKAGED CRAP. Invest in a deep fryer and make them from scratch with actual buffalo sauce.
2. How they make pizza. The sign says gourmet. It's far from it. Your food sucks, get someone who has taste buds and knows how to make a good pizza to show you how to make it.
3. Serving the pizza. STOP SERVING FOOD ON A CARDBOARD DISC. You guys truly deserve an EPIC FAIL for this.  

I seriously doubt I would ever eat here again unless they make a change in how they make their food and how they serve it. The food sucks plain and simple. I guess if you wanted to watch some Direct TV you could go, but don't ever go for the food."}
