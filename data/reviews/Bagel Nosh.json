{"text":"The best bagel shop I have been to ever!! They have sooo many choices of bagels, and listen to customer feedback (just added a Hawaiian bagel!! ) The staff there are very friendly and efficient! Anyone who lives around mesa must visit this cute bagel shop , you can also place an order to go. There phone number is 480 -807-5010. There prices are very reasonable as well. I used to always get my coffee from starbucks in the morning, but i am now getting them here, they have the best iced caramel mocchiato's and are cheaper than starbucks..  They also have a punch card that you can use when you purchase anything .. 10th punch is on them!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I go here for breakfast 3 times a week and I'm never disappointed. Get their breakfast sandwhich with a latte to go ..yum!!! Cute family business with a friendly atmosphere. Even though they are always busy, their service is very fast.  I don't know about the review on 11/29 but the bagels are always fresh and out of the oven when i come. Their cream cheese is home made and delicious!! Definitely a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"Great little bagel shop. I seem to always get the Ranchero breakfast bagel. It's so good.  It's my usual weekend stop for breakfast. The staff is nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"I did not like this location. I asked for a bagel and cream cheese and it was so sloppy. it was like my bagel was sitting in a bag full of cream of mushroom soup. And the inside of the place is old, appears a little dirty."}
{"text":"New Stopped in for lunch,not much in variety in bagels especially for lunch time.We looked at menu online before we got there, not the same when we walked in ,no ham and don't know what the bacon was from either.Tried to use punch card and was no so politely told there was new punch cards,even tho the new one he gave us was exactly the same as old .This wasn't our first time here, every other time time service and food was great,neither not so much anymore. We miss the old owners."}
{"text":"Not only does this place have the best bagels, but they also have the best customer service. A wonderful experience overall, looking forward to having breakfast here more often!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bagel place in the Valley (not just Mesa).  I'm often torn between the roasted red pepper cream cheese spread on a double toasted bagel (they even have a sign explaining the difference between single toasted, double, or triple toasting!) or the Sunrise breakfast sandwich with crispy bacon, red onion, and jalapeno cream cheese.  They open at 7:00 am on Saturday."}
{"text":"What a great find. I haven't found many breakfast joints that give off the \"mom and pop\" \"been here forever\" vibe that you find in other big cities. Bagel Nosh fills that void. Meal was fresh and affordable. The lox and cream cheese bagel I order was much better than the one I had for twice the price at a reputable/hip restaurant the week before. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! In Arizona, it seems like everything is a franchise, but this place felt very authentic and I enjoyed that. The service was really welcoming and our food was great. I got an iced coffee and a bagel with egg, cheese and avocado. She gave me a free refill of coffee which I appreciated. No complaints and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"New owners have really dropped the ball. It use to be great to wind down with some food and drink. Old owner and staff very friendly. New owner could care less. I will find a new place to go to where your business is appreciated."}
{"text":"Not nearly as fresh as I would have expected, and the flavored cream cheese tasted \"fake\" to me. Thought it was a little pricey. I haven't been in years, and probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Friendly folks, delicious authentic bagels, tasty cream cheese. We adore this shop and its kind-hearted owners. Only wish it were open later than 2 pm :) cuz sometimes we want a bagel sandwich for dinner!"}
{"text":"The Bagel Nosh is a great example of what a local owner can do to tailor a business to the community.  It took awhile for new ownership to get their feet under themselves. ( you can likely ignore reviews before Fall 2014 ) but the new team is hitting their stride.  The bagels are surely delicious and lunch is just as good .  What makes visits to the BN a real pleasure is the owner and staff make sure you have everything you need, providing personal service at fast food prices.  And lastly, I love the local touch the art for sale provides...I have my eye on one or two pieces of art on the wall now.  Don 't miss the BN if you are hungry for a friendly local place with tasty food at fair prices !"}
{"text":"My wife and I love bagel nosh, we go every week at least once and haven't had anything less than great.  We typically get a toasted bagel with cream cheese but their other pastries like fruit tarts are amazing too.   The bagels themselves are so fluffy, they're like no other bagels we've ever had. On top of this, their entire staff is very friendly and helpful.  The place might not look like much but it's so good"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I must agree with several of the most recent reviews. Having been a long time customer of Bagel Nosh, I've seen this particular location change hands twice in the past. Both times there were changes, but they were minimal. The biggest disappointment is the poor quality with this new ownership. The bagels are smaller and don't taste the same. Two Saturdays ago, there was a group of high school track students who had come in after their morning training run. I expected service to be slow that morning, and it was. But that's okay, I was glad that the store had a lot of business. But the person who took my order must have lost the order or gave it to someone else because the woman who finally put my order together came out and asked me three times what my order was. After waiting 25 minutes, she came out and asked me again. I was just about ready to say don't worry about it, you've obviously got your hands full, and just ask for my money back. But instead, I repeated my order to her. Ten minutes later she came out with my order. This morning hubby and I decided to try again. We placed our order (2 bagels with cream cheese and an Arizona Classic bagel sandwich). I presented my loyalty punch card which I've accumulated (finally!) enough purchases to earn a free sandwich. Under this new ownership, I was told that my punch card was no longer honored. Having purchased businesses myself, I feel it is poor practice to not extend good will to past loyal customers while building new relationships, especially for something as inexpensive as a bagel sandwich. It's a good thing I've got Kokabelli Bagel shop not far away as I doubt I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I really do love this place, and I come here about once a week because the bagels are just awesome! But I always leave frustrated. As a worker who also works in food service, I understand and appreciate how much tips go a long way. EVERY SINGLE TIME I step into this place I put $1 maybe $2 in the jar, they never say thank you. I'm giving you my money willingly, the least you could do is smile at me and show some appreciation.... Again, I love the bagels, 5 stars---customer service-2 stars. Hope the owner improves their employees attitudes."}
{"text":"We have been regulars for 9 years.  The new owners don't seem to have a clue.  I really hate to say this because I always try to support local.  Not only has the quality gone down, but the TIME IT TAKES TO GET YOUR FOOD!!!!  I am not kidding when I tell you 45 minutes to stand in line. Order. Watch 10 people scurry back and forth behind the counter. Finally got my big order which was one plain lightly toasted with light cream cheese and one breakfast sandwich.  Everyone was mad.  Everyone was up talking to the owner.  I thought it may have been a busy Saturday, but my friends just went yesterday and SAME THING!!!!  My friend waited 30 minutes and then opened her bagel in the car to have the order wrong.  So disappointed.   Note to owners: if people had 45 minutes, we'd be at Crackers and Company or IHOP to sit down and be served.  This is supposed to  be FAST FOOD.  New travels quickly and need to turn this around quickly.  I hate to see this place go under.  I'll happily update this review if things change."}
{"text":"This place is adorable, and the tables they have inside are filled almost every morning I stop in here.   The bagels are the best I have had in the state of Arizona!  I used to frequent Kokibelli, however our office has recently moved and I needed to find a new bagel place.  It seems to be the only one in the area.   They offer Breakfast sandwiches as well as Lunch Sandwiches..Pitas and salads as well..  The service is great!  Make sure to visit this place if you are in the area!   It is well worth the stop!  I will be adding their menu as soon as our scanner is hooked up!"}
{"text":"Went for bagel and lox and thought it was pretty good.  But way too pricey for 'pretty good'. $8??  I'll stick to Einstein Brothers."}
{"text":"This is a family owned business that takes pride in the food that they serve. I especially like the lox and bagel sandwich. It is a great place to hang out, eat, have a cup of coffee, and meet with friends or get work done. They even have a game corner loaded with games that the kids can play with the family or on their own. Just a comfortable place to eat at and hang out."}
{"text":"Fellow Foodies: These Bagels are the best Bagels in all the land!  These bagels taste like the Chef King made them from scratch with his magical ingredients, and baked them fresh in his golden oven. Their warm Chocolate Chip Bagel (now who can say no to that?), and their toasted Cheese Bagels are amazingly delicious. If you get them single toasted, they are warm throughout, and barely crispy on the edges, and pull-apart super soft on the inside. *Bagel Bliss* Oh, and they have homemade cream cheese. You will never taste cream cheese as good as this, unless you are willing to grab your apron and cheesecloth, and make it from scratch yourself.  Everyone I have brought here, has loved it. I know you will too :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since HighSchool and that was 10 years ago. You have to try the NovaLox and cream cheese. I haven't tried anything else really because the NovaLox is my favorite"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try the Ranchero Breakfast Sandwich this AM and let me tell you, it was fresh, delicious and one of the best Breakfast Sandwiches I have ever had.   If you live in the area - you need to stop by and try it.  Everything is made fresh: From the bagels, to the cream cheese!  Looking forward to getting back soon!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is the best place in Mesa to get fresh bagels. I love their cinnamon bagels and bagel sandwiches. Honestly though, I've never tried anything on the menu that hasn't tasted delicious. They have an excellent selection of fresh-brewed teas as well.  The shop has a comfortable, pleasant feel, and always smells like freshly baked bagels. On top of all of this, the owner is an incredibly kind woman who remembers and greets her customers."}
{"text":"Two people working at prime time on a Saturday. Slow as frozen molasses. 20 minutes for 2 sandwiches. great place if you've got nothing better to do but sit around and watch bagels go stale and  listen to microwaves in turbo mode. Totally boring bagel fare. zero imagination with their breakfast sandwiches except to name them with cutesy local names. Too bad. They had an opportunity to do something unique and chose to go mediocre."}
{"text":"Safi's BAGEL NOSH is a community friendly bagel shop. Not only is the owner extremely welcoming so are the staff. The bagels are full of flavor and come in a fresh variety of tastes and flavors.   They went out of their way to accommodate for our 2 year old and made a free fresh mini bagel for us.   This bagel place is what every eatery should strive to be."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! This is bagel heaven! Perfect crunch on the outside and the inside soft and melt in your mouth delicious. Their bagels are hand crafted and the staff is warm and friendly. I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"Very good food. Love their lox and bagel combo. It's a very relaxed atmosphere, the staff have always been friendly. And I absolutely love their coffee."}
{"text":"Fresh baked bagels in house. Their Lox & Ranchero bagels are pretty delicious. The new management is making great improvements to the place."}
{"text":"I love this place and the service is always first rate and I invariably throw a buck into the tip jar. But I confess that I was put off this morning by their new tablet payment system that confronts you with whether or not to tip before you can sign for your purchase.   I have absolutely no problem with tipping for table service, but when I go directly to the counter and buy something to go, the idea of being hit up with tip suggestions is disconcerting to me.   Maybe this will be happening soon at gas stations and Home Depot, but I hope not."}
{"text":"This is the best bagels place I have tried... They are so friendly that you eventually feel like part of the family, the bagels are baked to perfection, the ingredients are the best quality and they have great variety.  I used to order a crazy custom bagel sandwich and they already knew it by memory.  We were regulars for more than 3 years until we moved to Tempe, and now we miss them so much... There is no pop and mom place like this anywhere only impersonal not great big-chain bagels around."}
{"text":"Took 30 minutes to get a toasted bagel and egg sandwich.  With only one person in line ahead of us found this to be ridiculous.  When the food finally came out the bagel was cold barely toasted and tasted stale.  Won't be returning to this once great bagel shop, not sure what has happened."}
{"text":"We were visiting relatives in Mesa who took us to this place.The bagels and cream cheese are delicious, the atmosphere is friendly, and the service great.  What more can you ask of a bagel shop?"}
{"text":"My kids and I love the bagels here.  They are always fresh, chewy and delicious.  For someone who said they don't toast the bagels - they do - but their lowest toast is really just warming it up.  You have to specify how much you want them to toast it.  The atmosphere is just okay - although lately they have added some cool art that is available for purchase.  The staff is friendly and they try hard which goes a long way with me :)"}
{"text":"Should be called Saifs bagel natzi like the soup natzi in Seinfeld. This place is just strange. The owners cheapness shines through. Wife and I ordered the same lunch combo. A number 4 . This comes with the bagel sandwich,a drink , a pickle and a cookie. Close to $17 dollars for that was way over priced. It's off that the prices aren't posted on the menu. The Gal that made our food asked a strange question\" do you want your pickle and cookie with that\" if it's part of the combo which I'm Paying for then yeah I pretty much want it. I made the comment I don't like pickles and my wife said you can give my cookie to my husband and I will take his pickle. What we got was 1 pickle and one cookie although we paid for two that was included in the combo price. My wife said she watched the girl getting the second pickle from my order and the bagel natzi starred her down so she didn't give us the 2nd pickle which we paid for by the way. I Also didn't get the second cookie which I also paid for. We started to read the yelp reviews as we were eating and I saw the comment that the ac vent above the bagels is filthy. Apparently the owner doesn't read the reviews or he would have taken care of that. It was still coated with some greasy furry growth of some sort. Other reviews said that its s bad sign when you come in to a place and your first reaction is to start cleaning. There was some sort of greasy slimy build up on all the tables. I guess this place isn't subject to health inspections or the inspectors never have been in this place. Can't see coming back to thus place. I did load up on soda to make up for the lack of the pickle and cookie I was shorted. I was surprised there wasn't s sign that said no refills or even yet that the soda machine was out where the bagel natzi could control the dispensing of extra soda."}
{"text":"Excellent bagels and spreads. Great local neighborhood place. Breakfast sandwiches and lunch sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've stop at the Original Bagel Nosh in mesa. Being a New Yorker I'm always in search of a good NY style bagel. Passed by the other day & they're still the Best Bagels!!!  I'm in trouble because my family loves them, so I'll be in to buy a dozen at least once a week."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, good food, good service, good drinks. Haven't had the coffee but the chai is exceptional. I'm not religious but I don't mind that they're a Christian business that plays not that bad of Christian music. Only thing I would change is that the decor needs an update."}
{"text":"Pretty good bagels.  Stopped in to get a few bagels last week.  Was surprised at the prices. For a location such as this, they should be much cheaper. Those were prices I'd pay at an airport. And it didn't exactly blow me way either. Overall meh."}
{"text":"We go to this bagel shop on a semi regular basis. The bagels and various fillings are really delicious and the girls serving have always been very accommodating to special requests. There's a small seating area out front so my partner and I walk our dog up to this shopping strip on a Saturday morning and stop for bagels. I have read a few reviews about the owner being unfriendly or cheap but to be honest I think it may just be a culture difference as he is not from the U.S. We asked him for a large cup so we could give our dog water and he provided it to us with no problem at all. I have always found him quite but ultimately polite.  They offer loyalty cards where if you buy 10 bagels or 10 sandwiches you get one free. Overall we really enjoy going here. The only reason I have given it 4 instead of 5 stars is because it is a little bit more expensive then the average bagel shop."}
{"text":"I read somewhere they won a \"best of\" so i thought i'd give it a shot. Being from the East Coast, I KNOW a good bagel. I've SEARCHED the Valley for a bagel. Any. Decent. Bagel. Bagel Nosh ain't it. I ordered a half dozen, so we could try a variety, and every single bagel was nothing more than a roll. Seriously, what's a girl gotta do to have a proper bagel?"}
{"text":"Bagel nosh is alright not consistent service. Sometimes staff pleasant other times slow. Coffee gets cold fast but it ok. Not my first choice but will go if in area."}
{"text":"9 bucks for a bacon egg and cheese and ice coffee microwaved eggs and bacon not even fresh small bagle def not coming back obya 50 cent for flavor in coffee should went to dnd"}
{"text":"I'm not a bagel expert but I am from New York and know bagels. I used to love this place when Hector owned it. Then, another owner had it, and now I am unsure who owns it but the bagels have gotten very sad.  Formerly chewy and remarkable, they have deteriorated to grocery store quality that doesn't satisfy. They are so swollen and breadlike, often there are no holes. I had the last dozen presliced and each one has a 1/4 inch bottom and large top that now won't fit in my wide slot toaster.  Goodbye Bagelnosh. Whimper."}
{"text":"Apparently there are new owners. I'm so sad and disappointed. The new employees don't seem as friendly and quality has gone downhill. The bacon in my bagel sandwich seemed like it was vegan cardboard meat. I was actually afraid to eat it and risk food poisoning. They also did away with the punch card all of the locals were used to. The bagels aren't as good. I won't be returning. I tried to call four times prior to posting the review to see if I could tell them about my experience but no answer. I used to eat here once or twice a week to pickup food for the whole family- just sad."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a breakfast sandwich. I asked for it on a everything bagel, however it came on plain. Without a second thought they made me a new sandwich and wrapped up the other one for me to take. That's great customer service."}
{"text":"This place was great, I love the fact that it's family owned! The teenage kids working here work harder than some adults.  I got a bagel sandwich with scrambled eggs sausage and jalapeno cream cheese.. I could have done without the cream cheese it was a little rich, but still good and I'll definitely be returning to try other things!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's excellent! Everything is made fresh daily - bagels, cream cheese and pastries. The bagels are light and fluffy, my fave is the jalapeño cheddar.  I usually stop in once a week for breakfast to go. I usually get the \"Wildcat\" - bacon, plain cream cheese and tomato. The bacon is very lean and crispy, not chewy or fatty. My mom was just in town and we went two days in a row - she said it was one of the best bagels she's ever had. The service is excellent too - so friendly! They always remember me too - which is very nice.  Stop in! You won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Talk about OVERPRICED and unprofessional ....First off they have a Visa/MC sticker on their windows AND cash register yet have a sign CASH ONLY, then we order 2 bagels with cream cheese and it's comes to $6.32 yet a single bagel is $1.09 so cream cheese is over $2.00each for smothering some on top...What???????? The bagels themselves are pretty good but I would NOT come back to this place! Too bad, because I like supporting mom and pop joints versus chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow, very impressed! The bagels are fresh and the cream cheese is delicious. They were so sweet to my 4 year old son. They invited him back to watch how the bagels and gave him a mini dough bagel to play with. He had a blast! We will definitely be coming back.  Blueberry bagels with strawberry icing are a definite win for my kiddo as well."}
{"text":"What a disappointment , not worth the money. On the scramble bowl there was a sauce cup of ketchup underneath the food... take that out and there was no food!!! And the bagel was dough not even cooked through. My mocha coffee was about 5 pumps of chocolate and coffee...No Thank You what a waste of money"}
{"text":"Not very impressed at all.  Gone there twice this past week.  Should not of given them a second chance.  Got the dozen bagel deal the first time and more than half the bagels were hard, thinking that the bagels were more than day old.  The next time we went for bagel breakfast sandwiches.  Got 3 az classics.  If it weren't for being hungry and not wanting to waste the sandwiches we would of thrown them away after the first bite.  The eggs are literally mush in your mouth, thinking that they use powder eggs.  The sandwiches had a lack of flavor.  Will not being going back or recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious bagels.  I'm happy to find a place redolent of the East Coast. A good bagel is hard to find."}
{"text":"I called to see what time they closed and found out they just had a few minutes before I called. The sweet man on the phone asked how far away I was and offered to stay open and wait for me to get there! I rushed over and as promised he was waiting with a smile. Love the people here and the food is always amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place! Been coming here for years and never leave disappointed.  There are a variety of bagel and cream cheese choices. Sandwiches range from $6.50-7.75 and are HUGE! I usually do the build your own and get turkey, cucumber, sprouts, and cheddar cheese on a sesame bagel with jalepeno cream cheese. OH MY GOODNESS it is soo good and I'm salivating just thinking about it. The sandwiches come with your choice of potato salad, mac salad, or a bag of chips.  The bagels are always fresh and the flavored cream cheeses are so unique and tasty. It's such a clean place and the staff is really friendly! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a bagel place. I think maybe even better than Einsteins. However, I would like more cream cheese next time so I think I'll ask for extra next time I go! I got the Wildcat with no tomato. Their bacon was great! Also, the girl up front was sweet and also got checked out by the owner. He was cool. Was sad to see the one on Alma School and Ocotillo go. Didn't know there was another location! Will be coming back (:"}
{"text":"Saw this place on yelp and was excited to try it because of all the good reviews. Now that I've had it I went back and re-read the latest reviews to find new owners so I'm guessing they are thriving off old reviews. The short review - just skip this place altogether and you won't be disappointed.  The bagels - it seems like they are skimping on the flour here, instead of a bagel think circular French bread with topping. Tasty, but it doesn't have that dense chewiness of a bagel and the Flavors are very mild and un pronounced (tried: everything, French toast, chocolate chip, all bleh).  The price - $25 for 6 bagels and 2 drinks? That's highway robbery and I come from LA the land of overpriced food! Now, if the bagels were out of this world and they had some amazing coffee or ambiance I'd consider paying $25 but this place is nowhere near amazing.  Venue/Decor - think old pink donut shop decor (not the good kind). Think the type of place that you want to leave the second you step inside.  Cleanliness - it didn't feel fresh and clean  Service/Staff - surprisingly helpful and willing to make fresh bagels for you while you wait. - the only reason their review has a star (other than the fact that yelp won't let you give zero).   Sorry to be blunt, but it's all true. I truly hope the new owners read this reviews and make some improvements. It would be a shame to see a potentially good family owned business die."}
{"text":"This place used to be good when Hector owned and operated it.  At that time they also had competent staff.  It has recently with the past few years turned over many many times.  It seems to get worse each time I give it another try.  Their bagels are pretty good when they have them but often the service experience and the lack of inventory makes you want to jump through the glass window.  By the time my church lets out on Sunday they are usually down to the weird bagels and no sesame or poppy.  If there are more than two people in front of you when ordering, just run like hell."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents while they were in town. Had driven past this place countless times in my neighborhood but never stopped in. Everything was ok. Nothing less and nothing more. Obviously family owned, which can be good and it can be bad. I had a toasted onion w/light cream cheese and it did the job. Better than the mcdonalds it's next to!..."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town. The texture of the bagels is perfect, they are dense and not a chewy as other bagels. I also like that fact that they make the cream cheese there as well. My favorite is the Honey walnut. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars I would. Eggs seem like they're powdered, very bad dollar store brand turkey, ordered a waffle that was burnt to a crisp and not to mention it took 30 mins to get my order and they gave me the wrong egg scramble. Will never visit this place again. Seems very run down and dirty as well. Probably the worst breakfast I've ever had."}
{"text":"Bagel Nosh has a larger variety of bagels, sandwiches and gourmet cream cheeses than Einstein's does. The staff is very friendly. They are located at Hickey and Brown in Mesa."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim and I regret I did. I bought the ranchero sandwich and as I was eating the second half of the sandwich I found a long hair in it. I was so disgusted I could not way for the rest of the day. I paid a hefty penny for the food as well. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"So I love this place but what limits me from coming, they HAVE GOT to get more people. They are always so short handed and slow. You are losing customers! Step it up! One person to take orders and ring people up and make drinks. Ridiculous.  25 freaking mins for a damn toasted bagel? Never coming back now! Also out of Hawaiian bagels and my drink order is wrong- fabulous!"}
{"text":"The best bagel shop I have ever been to! I love their sandwiches and I love that there is always fresh iced tea brewed. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"The owner is so rude! Over talks you, acts like he is too busy to hear what you have to say. Unfortunate for a local business to treat their community members like garbage, they are the ones that keep you in business. Not this particular community member any longer, hopefully others have a better experience when dealing with John."}
{"text":"The Sedona on an everything bagel is the breakfast of champions! I get it every time I go in there and it never fails to disappoint. That and the excellent service keep me coming back again and again."}
{"text":"The food is good - but they only have one person working and it take FOREVER to get one sandwich and a drink!  SLOW SLOW SLOW I am always late getting back to work because they are so SLOW SLOW SLOW."}
{"text":"Really great bagel sandwiches! I absolutely loved their jalapeño cream cheese! 4 stars only because my husband got an everything bagel with cinnamon sugar cream cheese that had an odd flavor."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out today and definitely won't be my last! I tried the nova lox and it is to die for !!! You get your money's worth and a happy belly"}
{"text":"It is a bad sign when you walk into a place and instantly have an uncontrollable desire to clean something...anything... It would behoove them to maybe wipe a few things down, or brew their tea fresh in the morning, or possibly even bake their goods before opening, instead of the day before."}
{"text":"Disappointed ... went to get a bagel and the one I wanted was not available but were in the oven and would be 10-15 min ... but if I'd like they have a day old bagel that once toasted would be perfect.  I said no thank you and that I'd be happy to wait the 15 min for a fresh bagel. Paid for my order went and sat down and low and behold 2 min later they brought me my bagel.  My initial thought was great maybe they were off on their time but once I took a bite I realized nope this is a day old bagel .... the butter they put on it wasn't even melted. Unfortunately I had already left the store so I couldn't let them know.  Ugh!!! This made me sad."}
{"text":"Updated since I can't reply to the owner who is still genuinely unapologetic: your menu is the issue. And no, you didn't add vanilla to my coffee, because I'm telling you I drank it and had to add my own flavoring :) but if you did then darn you are stingy with it!  your bagels are so salty that I literally couldn't finish eating it. The dough was pure salt. Also I never mentioned that the egg was like a rubber hockey puck.  It's especially unfortunate that you feel the need to further attack me as a customer, rather than apologize for confusion OR just leave it alone. Top notch job at taking criticism and running a business, sir. And P. S. My boyfriend isn't from New York; I am.  Such a shame that we have to tell our friends how poorly this establishment is run."}
{"text":"Used to be my FAVORITE place. We went in yesterday, the bagels tasted horrible. Unfortunately, we took 6 to go to eat this morning. They were hard and flavorless the next morning. So disappointing :(   Also, pretty expensive with no menu prices listed!"}
{"text":"Excellent bagels and awesome people. I got a call to confirm and clarify my take-out order that I placed online. It was done on time and I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Freshest possible bagels... SUPER friendly staff. Look, you're not \"buying breakfast\" here... you are being \"served\" by people that obviously have a passion for what they do and convey a deep sense of hospitality and care. New ownership is motivated to make this your \"regular\" stop. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Omg the frappes here are amazing  after having a negative experience with a smoothie I told the worker and he made me the best frappe i have ever had !"}
{"text":"This place is the cats meow. I've been going here for over 10 years and the current owner has made this place a great morning and lunch stop. HaHarg!! Thar be much more than bagels at this fine establishment. Pancakes and hash browns and bears, OH MY!"}
{"text":"The bagels were very flavorful! Service was excellent as well. Tucked in a quiet shopping center would make it easy to overlook but it was worth the trip."}
{"text":"OK...so there were some things I left out of my first review. Mostly because I didn't want to portray myself as the obnoxious loud mouth that I am.   The first time I came here I noticed they had a sign on the door that said \"We're open on Thanksgiving\". I marched up the counter and told the guy \"Open on Thanksgiving? What a bunch of bullshit. People can go one day without their precious bagels.\"   Soooo wouldn't you know it....Thanksgiving rolls around and guess who just has to have a salt bagel? That's right - the woman who announced how despicable it was that a bagel shop would be open for 4 hours on this most sacred of feeding frenzy days. I hung my head in shame and walked in a few minutes before they closed. Of course, the guy mopping the floor was the same one I'd told only days before how I'd never go into a business on Thanksgiving. I avoided eye contact and ordered my bagels. They only had 2 salt left, so I got a couple of jalapeno and asiago cheese. The gentleman at the counter who I'm assuming was Hector (of Hector's Bagel Nosh) was awesome and gave me a couple extra asiago bagels so I ended up walking out with 9 bagels instead of 6! Now THAT is something to be thankful for!!!   Of course the bagel quality was amazing and we noshed on them until we weren't even hungry for turkey. Seriously, I'll take Hector's Bagel Nosh Bagels over stuffing and mashed potatoes any day of the year."}
{"text":"We used to LOVE bagel nosh. We would go in every weekend, without fail. Unfortunately, we drive by bagel nosh and pick another breakfast spot. Under the new owners, things have gone down hill FAST. The bagels are not nearly as soft , they are tough and chewy. Bacon and ham are no longer options. I have given it a few chances but I just not good anymore. I actually went to Einstein to get my bagel fix , that was a bad idea but, honestly, still a better bagel than what they are now serving at bagel nosh."}
{"text":"Terrific bagels like NY from what I was use to. Kate the owner not only makes great bagels and breakfast sandwiches she donates bagels to the Central Christian Church Acts Homeless ministry. I love the classic bagel sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagel sandwiches!! House made bagel was soooo good! Great friendly fast service! Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This place hand changed hands many times over the years but remains open! It had been YEARS since I had been here and I was pleasantly surprised at the remodel and with the now owners.   The food was good (had a breakfast sandwich and my kids had a bagel with cream cheese).   The only complaint that I have is that they do not display their prices on the menu board and I didn't get a receipt when I paid so I don't know how much everything was.    Because this place holds a special place in my heart (my wife and my first date, 10 years ago) we will be back!"}
{"text":"Sevice was good, as were the bagels. Cream cheese is kinda slimy, gooey vs thicker cream cheese which we prefer. It's good but I wouldn't crave it."}
{"text":"Can't be the same owners as the Awatukee locations....  I've lived in the neighborhood for 5 years, been in here about 10 times. I wish, more than anything, that it had the same service, selection and passionate owners as the other Bagel Nosh.   Notes on different visits - usually a younger staff, not overly friendly, just sort of \"there\" to get a pay check.   I ordered a buttered bagel (I'm not a cream cheese fan) and about had a heart attack when I found they charged me $1 for butter!   Went in this week at 7:50am on a Friday morning. Not more than 15 bagels available, I asked where the rest were and was told \"in the oven\". Little late....so I had to make due with a selection that looked similar to a gas station's.   Coffee was out on the same trip and I'm not sure what the gal did but I gave her my empty cup and she went in the back to get me coffee and then I think she streamed it to heat it...it was frothy and not hot. I've never failed to drink coffee....but this cup freaked me out and got dumped before I got to the office.   I pray one day they get there act together, but until then I'll go in desperation only and plan on disappointment.  On a positive note, the bagels are really good. The French toast bagel is amazing, but it's tough to enjoy when my teeth are grinding together from poor customer service, cold coffee and empty pockets because I needed a knife scoop of butter on my bagel. Bummer!"}
{"text":"The bagels are fresh every time I come and they have a good variety of breakfast sandwiches"}
{"text":"Yelp. I am so disappointed that you would post bagel nosh  being one of the best bagel places. I always read your reviews and love to read what other people say about the place they just experience. I have grown up eating bagels and have watched chompies come from the ground up. I would agree that's one of the best. Bagel Nosh on the other hand is bland and the worst cream cheese ever. I have given this place a second and third chance and come up with the same critique.This is 1 review sorry to say will only receive one star for me."}
{"text":"I have eaten bagels all my life. And I feel we are lucky to have Bagel Nosh.  Their bagels are the best .."}
{"text":"Do you love bagels?? What kind? Nova Lox? A delicious two scramble eggs with your choice of meat of bacon, ham, or sausage with cheese on a toasted bagel? (Sounds delicious doesn't it?) Then this is the place to be.  It is a simple and small bagel shop, but the staff is lovely as ever and everything is homemade and fantastic!!! Their freshly squeezed OJ is superb and obviously FRESH!  Their choices of bagels are excellent and over 20 choices.  They also have these yummy fruit tarts that are so cute and yummyyyy!~  Come check them out soon!~"}
{"text":"Staff not friendly, the girl making my bagels seemed overwhelmed and made one the four bagels I ordered incorrectly. Ordered a Chai Latte - DON'T RECOMMEND. They scoop \"2.5 scoops\" of chai powder, which the girl scooped 3 (still a lot). Very chalky, not good."}
{"text":"i have had a love hate relationship with this business today i ordered a lox sandwich.....8dollars it was given to me on the stalest bagel iv ever had......i would like a refund pleae"}
{"text":"I just love this quaint little bagel shop. The food is fresh and preservative free. The staff is warm and accomodating."}
{"text":"My family and I love this bagel nosh! The staff and owners are so welcoming and friendly. They remember our names and our orders! My son looks forward to going there almost every weekend, it's such a family oriented place!"}
{"text":"The bagels here are awesome and they make the BEST chai tea!! The owner is so nice and kind and takes pride in the food and drink he makes! The girl that works there is so nice too, my boyfriend and I LOVE this place and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"When I walked up to the counter to order, I waited for someone to come up even after I rang the bell. A guy can out and looked confused as to why I was there. The food was okay, but honestly you can spend the same amount at Kokobellis (close by) for more food at a better quality."}
{"text":"This is the worst if you like microwaved food than this is your place pre cooked eggs heated in microwave like rubber. Barely any meat on sandwich has no taste. Especially being I didn't ask for a scrambled egg!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I stopped in for a quick breakfast on the way to work, and the service was super quick and all employees were very friendly. Got a cinnamon sugar bagel with cream cheese, and it was nice and warm. Perfect! I'll definitely be coming back for breakfast when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Oh man, can't believe I'd never heard of this place before today - it's so close to where I live! Ordered a garlic bagel and it was insanely delicious. I'm picky about my bagels, but this one did not disappoint. First of all, it was huge. Secondly, it was so soft and dough-y, perfect like a bagel should be. I checked in and the manager gave me my free drink with no hassle. Everyone was friendly, service was fast. This might be he best garlic bagel I've had in AZ. Will be a regular at this spot for sure."}
{"text":"Support your local business, 'zonies! Fast, friendly service, reasonable prices. A baker's dozen bagels and two tubs of fresh cream cheese for $15.00 - try paying that at the Mensa bagels chain! The variety of flavors / choices is excellent: try the Hawaiian, the 'everything' with cheese, and the French Toast bagels - you won't be disappointed. Arrive early on a weekend morning for fresh, hot bagels served with a smile."}
{"text":"This place is the best! It my favorite little place for a quick breakfast in tukee. Rob is the best! He's so friendly and the staff is always helpful and the food is always perfect! I love that they have gluten free bread too! It's hard to find gluten free and vegetarian breakfasts for cheap and this place is right around the corner! Also their lattes are to die for  my boyfriend says the steak is really high quality and tastes delicious"}
{"text":"Had originally gone for salads (as they advertise on the door front) but the bagel sandwich was good!"}
{"text":"We love their bagels they have a nice selection of both bagels and cream cheese.  They are all very nice people. We have never been disappointed. Okay new owners have taken over and have had some issues. I spoke to them about mine being over cooked and they were apologetic. Very nice new owners."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a couple months.  They remodeled!!! It looks great!! Same great service and food!! Stop by here if ur in the area."}
{"text":"Stuck waiting 25 minutes for four Bagels. Employees were in the lobby, didn't feel the need to help the one girl behind the counter. Bagels themselves were great."}
{"text":"Only been there once and won't be back. The staff was fine, but the bagel sandwich was not good at all and the coffee was barely brown water; very weak. In fact, I went straight to Starbucks after we left and bought some coffee with actual caffeine in it. Way too many other good options in the area to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Solid.   Occasionally I get the bagel and lox itch so I decided to drop in.  Really friendly staff and a big menu selection. Pretty decent all things considered.  I tend to be a little apprehensive about the salmon, but this was fresh and tasty.  The cream cheese was good and the everything bagel was outstanding.  I'd definitely be curious to go back and try a bacon egg and cheese or something of that nature.  The ambiance was about what you'd expect and the price was reasonable.  Good coffee as well.  I'll be back, but will also continue to be on the search for a great bagel and lox, even though it might be tricky in this part of the country!"}
{"text":"I am from Philadelphia and finding a quality bagel here in Arizona is impossible! We came across Bagel Nosh one morning and decided to give it a shot.  We were beyond pleased with the taste and quality of the bagels!  It really reminded me so much of what we had available back east.  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Tried bagel nosh on a recommendation. Got there around 10:30 am on a Saturday. They were out of most of their bagels and seemed very disorganized. Bagels were good, but too many choices around Phoenix to wait so long. Had high hopes. Will go back to kokobelli bagel cafe."}
{"text":"I previously wrote a review about how my bagel with lox and cream cheese had way too much cream cheese and I did not like the taste of it. The owner messaged me and let me know he talked to his team about the issue, and I went in this morning to get another breakfast bagel sandwich and I chose the Ranchero, and it is really delicious. Kudos to the team, next time I'm over here in Gilbert I am definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Bagel Nosh for years because it has always been my fav breakfast place, and it is right down the street from my house. It has never disappointed me! They have a variety of yummy bagels and many different flavors of cream cheese! Also, the owners are super nice people. The service here is great, I am in and out just in time for work. If you haven't checked this place out yet you should!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a fast snack or light breakfast. Their bagels are fresh and Tasty with a huge variety to choose from. It is a bit pricey for just a bagel."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!  We wanted to try a local bagel shop because we were not happy with Einstein Bros last time we went.  It was so dry and tasted old.  Anyway I was surprised how uncrowded this place was since every Sunday morning I go to Einstein it's just packed.  I ordered lunch bagel sandwich combo and even though it wasn't lunch time they were super nice to make if for me.  My husband ordered Breakfast Bagel sandwich with coffee.  Now when you order lunch sandwich combo it comes with cookie, side of pickle and salad like macaroni or potato.  I was so full but couldn't stop eating. Their sandwich was so fresh and yummy.   Also people who work there are just so nice and friendly.  I can't wait to try other Bagels they have.  I only had Cheese and Jalapeno, and Asiago. They were delicious!  I'm especially curious about White Russian.  Prices, services and Bagels are way nicer then Einstein.  Only thing Einstein is better then Bagel Nosh is their interior decor.  If you want great Bagels must try Bagel Nosh. My husband took some pictures of our sandwiches but some how he lost it.  I will post some next time."}
{"text":"I drive by every day and had been wanting to stop by for quite some time. Like most Americans, I dream of a good bagel. They have a huge variety of sandwiches and bagels. I usually prefer chive cream cheese and was torn between all of the cream cheese options they had! The friendly woman at the counter recommended the roasted red pepper cream cheese and since I couldn't choose, she had my bagel made half with the chive and half with the roasted red pepper. I really enjoyed both but especially the roasted red pepper!! I appreciated her suggestion and her patience and I look forward to stopping by regularly."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this place because of the photos they have on their windows of their bagel sandwiches.  I finally found the time to stop by for breakfast and wasn't disappointed.  The lady working the counter was super sweet and patient with me while I debated a nova lox or egg, ham and cheese... the latter won.  I wasn't disappointed.  The sandwich was moist and delish... a lot better than Einstiens."}
{"text":"The bagels were awesome. Yeah we had to wait a bit to order but they have a kid friendly corner with toys and a Disney movie to entertain my 3 yo. They also serve the egg sandwiches with a side of salted bagel chips which were SO good. I'm from Ny and we miss the fluffy bagels. This place was the closest we've found! Definitely beats Einstein!"}
{"text":"Is the best bagel place I've been to? No. I came here for a \"to go\" breakfast with my man. As we were waiting for our food, he whispered to me \"this place is filthy\". The vent above the bagel rack was so dusty! The counters, floors and tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down either. We had already paid so we just decided to get our food and go. The guy who helped us was very sweet but incredibly slow. We spent almost 20 minutes waiting for 2 bagel sandwiches and a chocolate chip muffin. The bagel sandwiches tasted good (I tried a tomato basil bagel) and liked it. I also thought the variety in bagels was nice. The muffin wasn't my favorite but was edible. Prices were reasonable but nothing great. Just like my review says, A-OK."}
{"text":"Being from NYC, bagels were a staple growing up. This place has the best bagels I've have since moving to AZ. Great service!!! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and good bagels! Had a breakfast bagel and got a cinnamon bun. The cinnamon bun wasn't very sweet and the sausage was a bit strange but overall decent. I will definitely be back for a bagel sandwich and a smoothie!"}
{"text":"It was Sat morning and I was with my friend and we were headed to the dog park and said hey lets grab a bite to eat, so we stopped at Bagel Nosh. I love bagels, so why not!  This was my 1st time at a bagel nosh and I have to say, what a nice selection of bagels they have to offer. I picked out a jalapeno & cheese bagel that was still warm from the oven and jalapeno cream cheese. Like I said the bagel was still warm and the cream cheese really surprised me, they have whole slices of jalapenos in the cream cheese, that right there was the bomb!  Delish I tell you!  Fresh bagels & great cream cheese perfectly paired together!"}
{"text":"My coworker brought in bagels for us this morning and I had the cheese jalapeno with plain cream cheese. Hands down the best bagel I have ever had. I am so impressed. I will definitely be returning even though I live all the way over in Tempe! I would have posted a photo but I ate it so fast. Sorry not sorry :)"}
{"text":"Like watching a train wreck in slow motion will definitely be going somewhere else for bagels from now on disappointing have been going there for years.  The eight day old cream cheese was a nice touch (yuck!)"}
{"text":"Love Bagel Nosh! I'm here almost every week. I've lived in Ahwatukee all my life and never had tried this place until last winter and I'm glad I finally did. They have a huge selection of great fresh bagels and amazing cream cheeses. Their pancakes are to die for and they also make a great vegan shake. It's a great place to meet up with family or friends for a morning bite. They even have a small patio and they allow dogs. The only down fall about Bagel Nosh is it's a pretty small and can get super packed. You come up to order and they bring you the food which is nice. But if you come in between 7-10:30 on a weekend it's bound to be crowded and you'll be waiting for food for a bit. They need more staff and more room for tables. Don't get me wrong they have great friendly service/ staff they just need to hire more people to keep things rolling a bit faster!"}
{"text":"Had the best bagel and lox with my wife this beautiful morning I truly had a taste of heaven!  This will be our new spot used o drive all the way down to Scottsdale to get our lox fix but G-town has a spot of their own now.  The service was great the hours are early could not have asked for any thing more thanks for opening close to the casa!"}
{"text":"First off, I haven't been here in years. It has been renovated since I last went in. It looks very nice and I like the booths. They have a great deal Mon-Wed with a bagel purchase you get a free medium coffee or fountain drink. I got the coffee and it was REALLY good. The nova lox bagel was... Meh. The poppy seed bagel I got was great. Good sized. The cream cheese was fine. They were out of capers. Bummer but no biggie. The amount of onions, fine. 1 tiny tomato on each side and extremely small amount of lox.  If they had put a decent amount of lox. I'd definitely try another sandwich. Hopefully the toppings are more generous."}
{"text":"I typically only leave reviews if my experience is positive.  Had to make an exception here. Went to this spot on the weekend and the bagels were awful.  The two varieties i got tasted the same, like they been frozen at some point. I ordered an asiago bagel with egg and cheese.  The egg was pre made and reheated in the microwave with the cheese on top. When I got home to eat my much anticipated breakfast, I was immediately disappoited. Even the regular bagel with cream cheese was a let down. The cream cheese tasted sour.  I had a stomach ache all day. I'm very disappointed in the quality of the food served here. Won't be returning, unfortunately."}
{"text":"A total family run business,  you see grandma, the kids and the grand kids all working side by side.   I'm here on a busy Saturday morning and it is running smooth and well  My favorite is the salt bagel with jalapeño cream cheese. Yummmm.  Love supporting local and I am glad they are here."}
{"text":"Love the bagels and the staff is always friendly but....  I have been coming for quite some time and always get their bakers dozen which includes 2 tubs of cream cheese. They have a punch card where you buy 9 and get 1 free. Today was finally my free one. Yeah!!  Unfortunately when I get to the counter they tell me that it doesn't include cream cheese. I tell them that when I have ordered each time it came with 2 tubs of cream cheese and they say \"sorry, you only get bagels and each tub of cream cheese is $3.99\"  Bait and switch at its finest."}
{"text":"By far my favorite bagel place we've found in Arizona! We love the Nova Lox bagel sandwich. Freshly made bagels that are deeeelicious! You don't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here today for our breakfast 5th year anniversary after the gym. Food was not good at all even the smoothies was not good. Workers was nice though...."}
{"text":"i've been wanting to check this place out for some time now especially since i always see some of the ladies at work ordering lunch from this place. on mondays they have this sweet daily special with their lunch sandwiches....you get a free fountain drink and a side included with your sandwich. awesome. i was a bit overwhelmed by the menu when i first walked in. being the only one there i was feeling the pressure to quickly order something. i went with the turkey avocado club on a wheat bagel...can't go wrong with avocados or anything with bacon. =P definitely a good choice. had the pasta salad side which was tasty for the most part and i decided to try the passion fruit ice tea which was alright. super yummy food. i really hope i don't start getting cravings for this place."}
{"text":"Been coming here for at least 10 years and love it! I do wish they would make their sugar cookies but I would rather come here than any other bagel shop! They have art for sale as well which is really cool!"}
{"text":"We went there for the first time this weekend. I wasn't sure what to order so the nice lady behind the counter recommended the lox spread on a tomato bagel. It was absolutely delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. Not only were the bagels great, but the people that worked there were really friendly! This is a great family place. The food was outstanding and we will definitely be back! This is a must for a quick bite for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a review of the bagel nosh on higley and brown. I'm sad to write this review because bagel nosh used to be amazing when it was owned by the previous owners. Ever since bagel nosh got bought out, the bagels and quality of food has greatly diminished. My husband and I were regulars at bagel nosh for years and the bagels used to be the best bagels hands down! But now I would say these bagels are below par. Our last experience with bagel nosh cannot be described as anything less than garbage! The bagel sandwiches were extremely greasy, and the bagel itself was chewy and tough. It looked like a store bought hamburger bun with shredded cheese melted on top. The eggs were absolutely horrid and were mushy. For some reason they now use egg whites on their bagel sandwiches, and it's a flavorless piece of rubber!   It's very disappointing to write a review like this, but ever since the new owner took over, the recipes have changed completely. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Worst bagel EVER!!!!!  Ordered a Jalapeno cheddar and it was hard and dense.  On top of that, ordered the Lox Spread and there was about a total of a 1/4 tsp for the whole bagel!  Used to be okay bagel shop, but will never go back!"}
{"text":"I had the owner take my order today. He's very nice and helped me decide on my sandwich. He was making jokes- very personable. I got the Ruben pastrami.. YUM!!! So good!!  I like local own businesses and recommend this for breakfast and lunch :)"}
{"text":"Great bagels! Love going first thing in morning.  The have some amazing breakfast sandwiches too. The help is polite and helpful.  The place is quaint and quiet and not over priced. Parking is good. But it is kinda hard to find and you need to look hard to notice it.  I love it though"}
{"text":"I visit this lovely Bagel shop sometime last week. The gentleman at the front counter was very polite as well as helpful. It was nice to see how this location knew all their regulars by first name and could call there order to them just to confirm that was what they were ordering. The bagels I bought home all were delicious. I will be back. Than you"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels!! Its a cute little place hidden away. There aren't many bagel places out here, so it was great to find this little hideaway! They have some sweet and regular bagels to try and a yummy variety of whipped cream cheese."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast bagels. Jalapeño cheddar bagel with bacon, egg and cream cheese, that's what's up!!"}
{"text":"Bagel sandwiches were a 4 but customer service was a 2 because I asked for a menu I could carry to the car to review with my family (we were ordering to go) and after ordering when paying the prices were more than the take out paper menu said- when I asked about it he said prices had increased and the prices were posted on the case holding the bagels. He didn't offer to honor the price on the menu I was holding and had just gotten from them 5 minutes before. They also will nickel and dime you when you customize. I added onions and salsa and it was $.75 extra but they didn't mention it and I had to ask for a receipt when my order was $4-5 more than I expected. Prices are reasonable but I am not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Best bagels. Staff is really friendly and this place is always clean. Enjoy the music ;)"}
{"text":"They have a huge selection of bagels and spreads. They also make a lot of bagel sandwhiches. The tea is phenomenal! The customer service is okay. They don't acknowledge you right away if they are doing something. They also use a microwave for most of their cooked stuff like eggs. They have a punch card that they will punch when they feel like it."}
{"text":"I love Bagel Nosh. I have fond memories of stopping here before school my senior year of high school back in the day to grab a bagel on my way to class. I recommend a mixed topping bagel with chive cream cheese extra toasted!  On top of that, the lady who normally works the cash register is one of the most kindhearted and warm people I have ever encountered in customer service. I'm not sure if she is the manager or just someone who work every day, but her genuine attitude and willingness to make conversation with everyone gives me a deep hope for humanity.   Do yourself a favor and support a local business that has hardworking employees and visit bagel nosh!"}
{"text":"The bagels here are delicious. The location isn't very upscale and is located in a little shopping center. They put a good amount of cream cheese compared to other bagel shops. I got an ice mocha here which was just very basic compared to Starbucks. I was told to get there early before they run out of bagels. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I give them five stars especially because the counter girl Rachel remembers my sandwich every time I come in and it's  reasonably priced and unlike Einstein's  bagels this place will make your sandwich exactly how you want it. \"to order\". Love it"}
{"text":"I am a regular at this bagel shop.  This is a family favorite for sure.  I like that they have a great selection.  The cheese bagels are the best around.  Other favorites are Apple Crunch, Cranberry, and French Toast.   The Hot Cocoa is good and there seems to be many coming in for the coffee.  I can't speak for their sandwiches but they seem to be busy serving those as well.   Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Bagel choice was good. Cream cheese choice was good. Simple bagel shop but quick and friendly. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this bagel shop for many years and  have to say that it just keeps getting better and better! First the staff is so friendly and when I come in they are always smiling, say hello, and ask how I am doing- really great customer service! Even when they are super busy they always take the time to treat all their customers with respect and do their best to complete orders as soon as possible. There is a HUGE variety of bagels and cream cheeses, all made fresh and are absolutely delicious. This place puts all other bagel shops to shame! Einstein's does not compare!"}
{"text":"The price for a single bagel is .92 cents, add tax and its a buck.  If you buy six bagels they charge you $6.54.  That's $1.00 each plus tax.  I explained this to the clerk who kept saying, \"that's just what the button charges...\"  Are you serious?  I asked for the difference back and she refused saying again, that it's just what the button charges.    Either list the increased half dozen price so that I have a chance to agree to the price or fix the button.  I'm forced to dispute the charge."}
{"text":"It was very good, we might just go back, First day of chanukkah breakfast, lox and cream cheese. Yum!   Glad I found it, I still want  a real Jewish deli, but that is unlikely in the Arizona desert!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great and the owners and staff are so friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"There's a great down to Earth, no frills, community feel about the place. Service was quick and friendly & the cost was on target. No complaints other then I maybe wish my bagel had been toasted a bit longer. As for the food, the cream cheese was a little bit loose. It had a consistency like mayonnaise which I wasn't a fan of. However, it is FRESH! The chunks of veggies in the veggie cream cheese were bursting with flavor. Meanwhile the jalapeños in the jalapeño cream cheese actually tasted like jalapeño and not just heat plus vague jalapeño flavor. The jalapeño bagel on the other hand was a little lacking on heat & actual jalapeño. The bread part of the bagel had great texture and crust. You can taste the house made in these bagels. This seemed true for the other bagels we got too. Great \"bagel\" but kind of skimpy on what ever made it a specific kind of bagel. In the end I guess my issue is I just want more. I definitely feel like the quality and value was on par or above what I would get at other places. I would go here again. There just a couple jalapeños and thicker cream cheese away from 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I used to go nuts for their multi grain bagels. I would buy them in dozens & freeze them to eat throughout the week. I just recently went back to get my usual & they had gotten a make over. It look nice much cleaner than before. When I got home my usual multi grain bagels looked alittle different. They looked more glossy but I hoped they were the same. Unfortunate they weren't  I'm sad to say I probably won't be back. I loved those multi grain bagels & with them tasting different I'll pass in this place."}
{"text":"We just moved in the neighborhood and we're excited to see we could walk to this amazing Breakfast establishment!! The owner and his team are always friendly and accomadating!! The French toast bagel with cinnamon and sugar cream cheese are a delicious!!"}
{"text":"On a whim my boyfriend and I decided to stop in for a casual late breakfast and we were beyond pleased we did! Immediately upon entering, Sandra, the woman working in the front, greeted us and offered us menu suggestions in terms of what is most popular, as well as her personal favorites.  She was extremely friendly, and answered the tons of questions my boyfriend and I had for her.  In addition to the great service, the food was EXCELLENT!  Everything is freshly prepared and homemade and you can really tell.  Not only that, but they have a great variety - they had 21 different types of freshly prepared bagels on hand, 12 different kinds of cream cheese and tons of combinations available whether you are looking for something sweet or savory.  I ultimately decided on a multigrain bagel, egg whites, bacon and cheddar cheese as well as an iced coffee, all of which exceeded my expectations by far.  My boyfriend got the Arizona Classic with an asiago bagel, egg, bacon and american cheese, he was very pleased with his selection as well.  On top of everything, the chef/baker/owner, Ken, who runs this family-owned and operated location, came out and surprised us with samples of a variety of the cream cheeses he was whipping up in the back, and they were all outstanding!  Funny enough, I'm not a huge bagel person, and I can't wait to come back and try another combination!  This place is absolutely worth stopping into for a casual breakfast. I would recommend this spot to anyone, it is truly a hidden gem!  I will definitely be coming back. Thanks to everyone for the great experience and breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times, but haven't visited for awhile. I've never been disappointed. From the food to the service it's always an A+ experience. This morning wasn't any different. I was greeted with a smile. The young girl who is often there (I wish I knew her name to properly credit her) is fast, efficient and super friendly. I had a delicious breakfast sandwich in no time."}
{"text":"Was so excited to try this place and was so disappointed. The Arizona bagel sandwich was alright. I was blown away by the total price. Way over priced for a bagel sandwich. The bagels were extremely dry. Will look for a new bagel place."}
{"text":"Great bagels and the owners and employees are super nice. Bagels are made fresh throughout the day. Try the ranchero (egg, sausage, red onions & jalapeño cream cheese) for something different."}
{"text":"I used to love bagel nosh. Not so much now that they have new owners. Their bagels are NO WHERE NEAR as soft and as chewy as they used to be. It's a shame. When you go to get a bagel you expect their to be warm soft bread. The bagels are now supper hard and crunchy. Not to mention the size of the bagels has decreased. These owners have really changed things up in a negative way. I've also notice they don't put NEARLY as much cream cheese on their bagels as the old owners did. So not only do I get a hard bagel, but I get a dry one as well. It's such a shame. My friend and I went to get some lunch their. She ordered a combo A I think? They just started listing the items they didn't have in stock that was supposed to go on her sandwich. And by the time her sandwich was done, it was no where near the actual price she should have been paying. It a sincer shame. They even took the punch cards away? Like you can just take the punch cards away. Punch cards that people have been using for years! They just took them away. I understand they have them back now.... But why? Why change things up SO MUCH?! if you run a bagel place you really shouldn't have HARD AND CRUNCHY bagels."}
{"text":"Love love this place. The bagels are amazing. Service is wonderful. I need to try more but the bagels are so perfect. Have tried the salt and the onion   Amazing."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago I was in the Phoenix area and found Bagel Nosh on Yelp.  Their bagels are chewy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside-just how you want a bagel.  They have bagels ready to go, as well as an assortment of bagel sandwiches.  The person who helped me was very nice and put together my bagel quickly and it tasted great.  The only possible downside was the coffee was a little cold, but then again I came after the breakfast rush.  Try the Bagel Nosh and I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Adorable place with great bagels! Went there today on my lunch break and was pleasantly surprised by the menu and atmosphere. I also thought it was VERY cool when I asked if they had salt bagels and was told 'no, but we can make you one using a plain bagel and salt!' That is a five star answer! Had a salt bagel with chive cream cheese and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Love love LOVE this little place. The bagels are always fresh and delicious. The pastries are a wonderful treat, and the customer service is fantastic. Bagel Nosh makes me happy in the mornings!"}
{"text":"Business was busy but it didn't capture my favor.  I wanted to try it out for a while since it wasn't in my hood I waited for today when I was driving by.  Three young women taking orders were not organized and management has not give them enough working space.  They were working over each other.  Kinda clueless girl couldn't really tell me what the difference was between the breakfast lox and bagel and the lunch version.  I ordered the lunch version which was certainly big BUT she put so much cream cheese on it the taste of the Lox was completely lost.  Disappointing.  I'm not fond of Einsteins service either but I like their bagel and Lox better."}
{"text":"I love fresh bagels and this place didn't disappoint. I felt the prices were a little high for the sandwiches but it has that little Mom and Pop feel. The place seems like it could present itself a little cleaner but overall not terrible. Both times I've been, there has been a young man at the cashier and he has always been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"It was ok at best!! Bagel choices were average. It is no Einsteins by any means!!! I was told there was no bacon to put on breakfast sandwich, it would be awhile. Ordered husbands bagel sandwich and they screwed up the order... not even close to being the correct bagel!! Customer service was weak at best!! We will most likely NOT be back!! Oh well, thought we would try local... not so much! No flavor to egg or sandwich, it was disappointing!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious bagels! Super friendly service and one of the best everything bagels I've had in years."}
{"text":"I would have given this place four stars, but the employee serving me was inconvenienced by my business.   The bagel was delicious, although the cream cheese was could have been thicker in texture. I ordered the asiago bagel with Nova Lox spread.  The iced coffee is surprisingly good. I usually don't think places will have great iced coffee if the main focus is elsewhere (like bagels). Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We always order the Arizona Classics with bacon & cheddar on French toast bagel or bacon cheddar bagel. Plus we get a 3rd bagel to share, usually a sweet one like French toast or chocolate chip with honey nut cream cheese. The owners are extremely friendly and kind. Jessica is awesome and always remembers us & our order as soon as we walk in! The delicious bagels are not the only reason why we come here weekly!  It's truly a family experience. Now we bring our newborn daughter to share the love!"}
{"text":"Sadly this place is under new ownership. Listening to the people ahead of me placing their order was almost comical. Everything they asked for was followed with, \"we're out of that\". No apologies, mind you. More like they were annoyed that the customer didnt ask for something that was in stock. One kid is hiding in the back, avoiding the customers, and one girl is hopelessly trying to help everyone. She calls for backup and I assume here comes the new owner because when I ask if the place has changed hands, she is quick to answer me. (That's the only thing quick here) and I tell her it's obvious there are new owners. She immediately gets defensive and asks oh yeah why is that? And I say, well, your employees don't seem to give a crap, you're out of everything, and that kid just told his coworker he was going to hide in the back and apparently wasn't kidding. How are you out of everything on a Tuesday morning?  She replied with more rudeness and defensiveness.  It feels like they don't want to make/order enough food because they don't want to waste? Isn't it more of a waste to not have what your customer wants? One final warning, I left a review a couple days ago and the owner confronted me in a private message. Seriously is that a thing, when you leave a review, the business owner can private message you? I can see giving them the option to publicly respond to a review, but to pm me directly and say those things??  Something is rotten at Baglenosh."}
{"text":"Had tried place once before and had a good experience so went back today and it wasn't the same. Unprofessional staff today.. stood at a register for 5 min before the girl standing there told me I had to go to another register and then that person stopped me in the middle of ordering and had the same girl come take my order (seemed like they were fighting because they were super grumpy at eachother). 3 employees finally come out of the back and one seemed to be a manager who kept asking what the customers waiting.. orders were..and got home a they left off my cream cheese!"}
{"text":"The bagels are actually very good, but it seemed awfully expensive... We had two bagels toasted with cream cheese and it was $7! Like other reviewers mentioned, they don't show their prices so who knows what the heck I actually got charged for.  I'd like to come back, but seriously...add prices to your menu!!"}
{"text":"Bagels are good but service is terrible.  This place is about 1/4 mile from my home.  I have been here only 3 times since they opened.  The first time it took about 1/2 hour to get a toasted bagel and cream cheese.  The second time was yesterday when I came in and placed my order to pick up on Mothers Day.  I spoke with Katie the owner and told her specifically what types of bagels I wanted, how much Lox and when I would be in to pick up the order.  When I arrived, they had the Lox set aside in the back (at $20 for 1/2 pound) but no bagels.  They were completely out of Plain Bagels.  They did not know anything about the assortment I had specifically requested from the owner.  I had to ask TWICE if they could make some and with a lot of attitude from the \"baker\" I was told it would take 10 minutes.  20 minutes later I got some Plain bagels, paid $40 for a dozen Bagels (12 NOT the \"Bakers Dozen\" of 13 as advertised), 1/2 pound of Lox and 2 containers of Cream Cheese.  The kid waiting on me was \"nice enough\" to only charge me for the \"Dozen Deal\".  Really?  What were you going to charge me when I purchase a dozen bagels?  There were 3 young men behind the counter.  I found it comical and the customer behind me found it frustrating that they could not help more than 1 customer at a time.  I will not be back anytime soon which is a shame.  I like to take my clients Doughnuts when I meet them in the mornings and thought that Bagels would be nice.  I think I'll just stick with Doughnuts unless I'm near Chompies."}
{"text":"I come here often and usually don't have any issues.  The bagels are great.  I was in there last Sunday and it was a little busy, ordered 2 bagels and Lox.  After 20 minutes of waiting, I was finally advised they only had enough lox for one bagel!  I don't understand how it took 20 minutes to figure this out.  They said I could have a refund on one bagel or make another, at this point I was so tired of waiting I asked for a refund.  It then took another 15 minutes to get my other 2 bagels and the one with the bagel and lox had the wrong bagel! I didn't want to wait any longer so I left.  I don't know what is going on here, but sound like they need a refresher in customer service!  I love the bagels but if I keep getting this kind of service, don't think I will be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Bagel alone, this place is a solid 4 stars. Entire experience not so much. Girl behind the counter put gloves on but then touched her hair, her face, scratched her ear, pulled up her pants... Then she realized that I was staring at her and changed her gloves. During that 45 seconds she asked me three times if I wanted the bagel toasted. The place could definitely use a good cleaning. Windows are foggy looking with streaks and dirt, dust behind the fridge area is very obviously not a concern, menu board looks neglected. If I wasn't such a sucker for bagels I would probably drive else where to get breakfast on my way to work. Too bad there isn't any where else to get a bagel between my house and work :/"}
{"text":"I came here a few years ago when I moved to the area, and wasn't impressed. When my husband suggested going today, I reluctantly agreed since it was so close by. Although the interior is a bit sad, the food and service was top nosh! (Notch... Get it? Hee hee) The girls were sweet, my bagel was delicious, filling and full of flavor. Typically after eating an Einstein bagel, I am still a little hungry. But this bagel was so dense, I could barely finish it. And it is worth mentioning, they had fresh baklava! I was overjoyed. When I got to the cashier, (who I think is the owner's wife?), she was the absolute sweetest thing, and was so genuine as she told me she hoped I enjoyed my baklava. Also they hand out Hershey kisses with your receipt! From start to finish, I felt valued and appreciated as a customer, and the baklava was just the right amount of sweet! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagel sandwiches, enormous menu selection and super-friendly staff. Interest selection of for-sale art on the walls to browse as you wait."}
{"text":"Great place for bagels. Relatively low wait times, less crowded than chain restaurants for bagels like Einsteins, and decent pricing. Close to Fry's so it's convenient. Service friendly. Would recommend"}
{"text":"I am surprised at some of the low reviews for this place. Since moving to Gilbert, I rave about Bagel Nosh :) It is probably the best place for bagels and the service is fantastic! Recently, I took my boyfriend there and he quickly understood why this is my new addiction. The staff is friendly and the Honey Walnut on French Toast- to DIE for!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love the bagels here and the variety of sandwiches and hot drinks! The staff is very friendly and I really like that they support local artists by displaying their work on the walls."}
{"text":"Wow! I am shocked.. over something so small.. I'll start off by saying the bagel was good which is why I'm giving 2 stars and not 1.. the ladies working in the morning seemed nice and it was fairly busy, they were doing the best they probably could as there were only 2 of them up front.  I had a free coffee because of the Yelp offer that right after I left I noticed I was actually charged for. The difficult part is that they were out of 2 of the 3 kinds of coffee they had, and I didn't want decaf, so I didn't even get coffee.. I called the very next day and the person on the phone said they'd probably be able to refund me and get me the free drink.  Shortly after our phone call she called back and said unfortunately they cannot refund because it's not the day of (I called the next day because I was in training all day the day of and they close early). Anyways- she said they would give me a free coffee next time I come in.. which really means replace the coffee I paid for that I shouldn't have even paid for in the first place... honestly in the grand scheme of things it ridiculous that I chose to spend a few minutes to write this over $0.81, but to me that shows the type of customer service the owner provides. Thanks for reading!  Update- the owner responded \"Hello, I was notified about the issue however our policy is that we cannot combine coupons from different sources! Your coupon is valid and it's not a \"scheme\" as you mentioned but not as a combination of coupons. Thanks!   Wow, just wow! I have a feeling he didn't even read my review.  I never attempted to use 2 coupons. I tried to use 1 Yelp coupon for a free coffee that I happened to be charged for and in the end never even got because they were out. I called the very next day (as they close at 2 pm) and asked to have the $ refunded and get the free drink I was supposed to get in the first place. (Changing review to 1 Star)"}
{"text":"I hate panning a family business like this, but they need a lot of improvement.  The kid at the counter took my bagel order on a yellow legal pad, but directed me to the lady at the cash register to order my coffee.  While I stood in line, a perturbed woman cut in front to get a refund for something she ordered and paid for, but was later told they couldn't make.  During my brief wait, I witnessed the following occurrence twice: a server came out with someone's order, called their name, and when the customer tried to verify the order was correct by asking what it was, the server gave an exasperated \"I have no idea what it is\" or \"I don't know!\" in reply.  I asked if the bagels come toasted, and was told they toast all the bagels unless requested not to... however, my when my bagel arrived, it was not toasted.  (Still, it was delicious, and the reason I give this place more than one star).  My macchiato came in a 20 oz. foam cup, despite my request to serve it in a mug (they asked my preference when I ordered).  Have these people ever made coffee before?  It tasted like 16 oz. of cold milk with a shot of espresso!  They got the recipe backwards!  If you try Bagel Nosh, go in and order a bagel with spread To Go and skip the coffee."}
{"text":"I feel bad leaving a two star review... I really, really do. But if you're a New Yorker looking for a bagel like back home. Skip this place. It's been awhile since we've been here and you can tell the place has changed hands. The inside is spotless and welcoming but the bagels we picked up for our road trip were \"blah\". The plain cream cheese is weirdly salty, the exterior of some our bagels were crumbly and flaking off (weird), and they had none of the \"chew\" that a good bagel has. We ordered a few of them toasted - but there was zero crunch to them and to top it off my daughter found a weird brown glob in her strawberry cream cheese. I'm certain it was from another bagel - but we were the first customers of the day - and we didn't order anything that had anything brown in it (so maybe from yesterday?)."}
{"text":"Ordered the egg white scramble. Frozen hashbrown patties were cold. The rest of it was disgusting as well. I have no words for this. Currently experiencing upset stomach from eating it. However the owner was friendly and their coffee was amazing. I would return for the house coffee, my boyfriend enjoyed his breakfast sandwich. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing here?"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this place out for breakfast. We were both in the mood for bagel sandwiches and since moving from NY almost two years ago we've never really like bagels from anywhere else because it's just not the same.   Today my husband got the Arizona bagel sandwich with bacon and I got one with turkey bacon. Overall, the bagels were really good! I should have asked for crispy turkey bacon because it was a little chewy but next time I'll just ask for that."}
{"text":"I like going to this place for breakfast. I usually get the breakfast sandwich on a plain bagel and it always tastes great. The inside is clean and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great bagels!!!!  Their breakfast sandwiches and bowls are delicious!  Great service from a family run company!"}
{"text":"I have never been in here when it's busy; however, the bagels are excellent so I am always surprised the lines aren't wrapped around the corner. Today I had a Sedona Bagel sandwich - bacon, onion jalapeno cream cheese on an everything bagel. Excellent!  I will say that the building isn't really fancy, but I don't care. I'd rather have good food and meh atmosphere then meh food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We always comes to this bagel shop because it's the nearest shop to our house. I waited 20 minutes before being helped today. It was not busy, I have come when they are busy and they have been on their game. Today was not the case. Several people left due to the extremely long wait, just for someone to even say hello. They had little to no bagels, other people were upset they didn't have their usual bagel choice. The girls behind the counter were frustrated and it was easily seen on their faces."}
{"text":"Great bagels!! Great service also. We come at least once a week and the young man that works there always remembers our order. And he make the best bagels."}
{"text":"Very clean and very pleasant young man working the counter. They have a good variety on their menu and the bagels were delicious."}
{"text":"As someone from the East Coast, I'm always looking for that familiar New York bagel taste. Unfortunately, Dunkin Donuts and Einstein's just don't cut it. I originally went to Kokobelli's in Mesa, but after several bad visits, I decided to try out Bagel Nosh. When you walk in, the place appears to be very \"home-y\". There are boards of many different menu options--all which I'm looking forward to trying. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese. Unfortunately, they put the wrong cream cheese on it, but they repeat the order--which is great so I don't have to drive all the way home and find out! The staff working were very friendly. The bagel was perfect! Everything I miss about New York bagels. They definitely do not skimp on the cream cheese! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Always love the Sun Devil sandwich with veggie creme cheese.  Saif makes a great latte too!  The bagels are always fresh,  and the staff is very friendly.   Happy Yum."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked into a small strip mall shopping center. I had \"the wildcat\" bacon cream cheese and tomato on a bagel. Very good for something light. Employees were very helpful and fast. Definitely will be back. Our kids enjoyed their blueberry bagel."}
{"text":"Love this place.  We pick up bagels on weekends and holidays. Occasionally get a sandwich, that is Very yummy too. They always have customers,  but its never so crazy busy that we don't want to go in there."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels!!!   My friend and I went here for lunch one day and he ordered a turkey and I ordered just a plain sesame bagel. I had stopped by Fry's and bought some vegan cream cheese before going here so I was able to smear some of that on. The bagel itself was really good!   The staff working was super friendly and helpful too. I liked how they had a wide variety of drinks from fountain drinks to coffee and tea to bottled beverages in a cooler."}
{"text":"Bagel Nosh is a quaint little bagel shop. They have a multitude of bagels to choose from.  I had a breakfast egg bagel sandwich and half dozen bagels for coworkers. This looks like a small family owned bagel shop, which is nearest bagel shop respective to work.  The prices are quite reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Bagel nosh is our favorite local bagel place. The service is generally very good. The bagels are very good, my wife loves the French toast bagel and we have not seen these anywhere else. The jalapeno cream cheese is one of my favorites. Yes it's small, but never too crowded like some mainstream bagel places become. The decor could use a lot of updating, but if you can see past that then you will truly enjoy your breakfast or lunch. Prices are low, a plus as well."}
{"text":"I Really love their bagels! They are so fresh and yummy. Great breakfast sandwiches and bagels!!! I really love the Arizona one. Plus they give you an extra bagel if you order a dozen. Great location and across the road is a really great gelato place too!"}
{"text":"I am trying to figure out if I don't know what a good bagel is, or if other people don't know what a good bagel is.  I have been to this place twice.  The first time I was unimpressed.  This time, I was really unsatisfied.  I got the same bagel (jalapeno cheddar, my favorite) both times, as to be consistent.  The first time I ordered it with cream cheese,  It had a little heat, but was not that flavorful.  I decided to try it again, but this time I just stuck with butter, like I make them at home.  I noticed it had a very meal-y type texture that was not very appetizing, aside from the fact it did't taste much like the bagel I thought I was getting.  I have to be honest, I can get a much better tasting jalapeno cheddar bagel at Fry's for fifty cents.  Aside from the bagels, I found the dining room to be cold (aesthetically) and uncomfortable, especially compared to similar businesses.  On the upside, employees were friendly.  I don't frequent bagel places, but the prices seemed reasonable for what I got."}
{"text":"Sooooooo....I haven't actually been here, but Bagel Nosh is top of my UberEats list! Weekend breakfast, the smell of bacon, fresh everything bagels...here in 30min with no clean up lol  Who doesn't love that ?!?  However, convenience wouldn't merit a 5 Star review...but these bagels do. Fresh, flavorful, the right texture inside and out. Looking for a real NY Style bagel, this is it (I'm from Jersey, but pretty close). Granted, these aren't filled with wonderful NY water, but they also lack smog infusion and you won't get mugged going to pick up a box :)  So my take? Invite your grandparents over, order up a box w/chive cream cheese, be a hero!"}
