{"text":"Good beer, very friendly and helpfull staff, great food, reasonable prices. Located right in the bar and restaurant disctrict of Calgary, great vibes, very entertaining."}
{"text":"I came here with another person yesterday. We were greeted by the hostess and were seated immediately. Our server greeted us as soon as we sat down and told us the specials for the day and also told us that there menu has a bit of different selections because one of the owners owns \"the red dragon\" downtown (I could be wrong on the name) and it's been around for 50 years which is extremely cool.   He ordered the Kentucky burger which was absolutely delicious and I had the pulled pork sandwich and they also brought over a rack full of different BBQ sauces. We had the soup of the day which was the cream of broccoli! To die for! It was SO good and I also got Mac and cheese for my side and that was extremely cheesy, hot and creamy.   In the mean time two men came over to ask if we were doing good and he recommended everything we ordered and he was absolutely right about it all!   I will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"Never during my time in Calgary have I ever experienced such fantastic customer service as I did while visiting Trolley 5 for the first time last week.  After a disappointing experience at Home and Away, my partner and I decided to try out Trolley 5 instead during the YYC Taco Fiesta. Though we live nearby, we hadn't been in before because it was always jam packed with people, which can be a bit overwhelming.  However, it was a rainy evening, early in the week and it wasn't too busy so we popped in. To be honest, our server was so-so. Not a lot of personality, a bit mixed up about some of the beers on tap (we didn't get to try some of the beers we'd hoped to as he said they were 86'd, as it turned out, they weren't) and he just seemed a bit exhausted on the whole - but still very friendly.  Beers were on for $3 - how can you go wrong at that price?! We ordered the taco special and the ribs which were also on special. I knocked a star off this review because the food wasn't that great. The ribs were all gristle and no flavour to speak of at all. The tacos were alright, but again, quite bland overall. My partner really enjoyed the in-house-made hot sauce though. (A bit too spicy for me but I'm a spice wimp!)  The manager came and checked on us and he was outstanding. We had ordered the taco platter but only one taco got rung in - so we had to wait a few minutes for the other two. He was incredibly apologetic - even though we weren't concerned in the slightest! Another manager brought us the two tacos and chatted with us about the hot sauce and how it's made. Both managers really personalized the experience which was so nice - introducing themselves, getting to know us - that never happens in restaurants anymore.   We got our bill and picked up a growler holster for our bikes - how awesome is that?! The first manager was still apologizing for the taco mix up and to make up for it gave us each two-for-one cards to their Sunday brunch. Totally unexpected and unnecessary - but just a really genuine touch that will guarantee repeat business from us.  The next day I biked down with my growlers to get them filled and the experience was every bit as good as the night before. The manager and bartender let me try a bunch of tasters, we had a great chat about some of the local beers they carry, and they told me about some of their upcoming special events. Super friendly, again, they both introduced themselves to me, and personalized the experience. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A hopping joint with a lively atmosphere, plenty of south facing seats overlooking 17th Ave, and a hot Nashville chicken sandwich to die for. Not much of a beer drinker, but the prices seemed decent for the location, if somewhat more limited than National or Craft. Better food and an atmosphere more conducive to talking with friends than either of those places though. We'll be back as the weather warms up, to people watch and soak up the rays in style."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and always had excellent service! The atmosphere is perfect and the menu is amazing. So much to choose from and the food is always delicious. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was horrible,  service was horrible will not be back got over charged nice place but complete waste of time"}
{"text":"The service and the food was excellent the servers got to know our names and the manager came up to describe the food and let us know how long to meet up in smoke presentation was excellent and the quality was great I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Me and a group of friends went there during Stampede. I was a guest as i am visiting from Toronto. I was a bit disappointed. The uncomfortable sits are placed so close to each other that we could barely move. And then servers should have squeezed there way through the costumers. Was not too surprising to find the servers not so friendly! It took just a bit short of 10 minutes for me to get my first beer order!!! What was the most disappointing was the high prices of the food, some of which where not available anymore. Their prices does not match either the atmosphere of the place or the quality of the food. Something that was pretty interesting was that me snd a friend checked each others different in-house beers. Couldn't say the difference!!!  The brewery area was pretty cool and interesting though. To get the the downstairs washroom you have to pass by the big beer tanks, but to get there you need to walk quite a distance.  Its a no repeater!"}
{"text":"I think it's hilarious that Trolley 5 Restaurant & Brewery isn't officially open yet and there are 4 (soon to be 5) reviews up on Yelp. Trolley 5 is a gargantuan addition to the 17th ave scene. The three floors of space mean that there's plenty of space to meet with friends or go for dinner with the family (kids are welcome until 9 pm as per AGLC regulations). While each floor has large bar area with plenty of taps for 'beers to come', each differs in style.  The first thing you notice when you walk in the main level front door is the super cool, mesmerizing overhead conveyor belt upon which empty growlers weave their way throughout the main floor seating area before disappearing to the basement level where all the cool kids go (because there's a hot bartender...I'm looking at you beardy man!). The main bar is situated along the far wall and the seating is comfortable and not too packed together. The street level patio area will be the perfect spot to sip beer while people watching. Downstairs, there's a large U shaped bar with seating and the surrounding tables. It's dark, it's a bit quieter, and it has peek a boo windows into the ladies toilets. Don't worry, you're not exposed...but you do have a view of the brewing tanks! The very top floor is more of a 'dining area' with large yellow padded booths and a gorgeous bar-style seating area overlooking the avenue. It's the perfect place for people watching without having to inhale the smoke from ground floor level sidewalk smokers.  I'm not going to comment on the menu, so far as to say it is quite extensive with the most expected gastropub dishes available (burgers, pizza, poutine). I am predicting that the house favourites will be the more meaty smoke house options like the 12 hour brisket and wonderful pulled pork. I like that Alberta grown/produced items are marked as 'AB' on the menu and that they already have two mealshare items. Last, but certainly not least, let's talk beer. There is currently no beer brewing at T5 but the owners, PJ Hereaux  L'Heureux, Ernie Tsu, and Wayne Leong were able to rent brewing space at Tool Shed Brewery in order to brew Trolley 5's very first beers; the Derailed Pale Ale, and First Crush IPA. They were also able to collaborate with Parallel 49 to create Cowboy Crusher (It's a Stampede thing) and local brewers Last Best Brewing to create the Downtown Dunkel Dunkelweizen. So far I've liked what I've seen and consumed at Trolley 5 and I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Friends and I went here yesterday night for the first time! Don't usually go to restaurants downtown but this one is worth going to! The service we got here was amazing I don't think I've that good of service at a pub in a long time. Anytime a waiter or waitress walked by would ask if we're ok or needed anything. And the food was excellent! I had the southern fried chicken burger, and my friends had the chow mien and the poutine which were also delicious!!"}
{"text":"The Cobb salad is the prettiest salad I have ever seen. Fast service and friendly staff. The beer is good as well and they allowed for numerous tasters before selecting the one I wanted."}
{"text":"Trolley 5 has a great vibe on a weekend evening.  The wait staff and bartenders are very attentive and helpful and service was great.  When we went after Stampede they were out of 3 of their 5 beers but the stout and IPA were very good so I can understand how they ran out.  My main complaint with Trolley 5 that prevents me from giving it 4 or even 5 stars is the quality of food and barbecue in particular is not up to the quality it needs to be and would say it is mediocre at best particularly in comparison to some of the other new bbq joints that have opened around Calgary recently.  Also I found their sauces to all be extremely runny.  If your looking for a place for a drink, good environment, and somewhere to hang with friends or people watch this is a great place.  If your looking for good food as well, you may want to look else where.  Will have to give it another try!"}
{"text":"Awesome new Brewpub on the Red Mile! Locally sourced ingredients for unique dishes make this addition to Calgarys food scene a must-try. All your classic favorites with on-site smoked meats: Brisket, chicken, pork loin, pulled pork & ribs. What note could you ask for...?  Beer! The unique and original west-coast style brews really set Trolley 5 apart. The hoppy Derailed Pale Ale and the First Crush white IPA are amazing new beers that are made on location and really worth stopping by to enjoy. The Stampede session ale, Cowboy Crusher, is the perfect beer to pair with a long visit to the patio... Although it's difficult to stop at one!  Trolley 5 has burst onto Calgary's already competitive and diverse food scene with a unique mantra: Born & Raised. After visiting and testing what they offer, it's clear that Trolley 5 will take its rightful place as an icon of this amazing city."}
{"text":"What a great local brewpub! I've now been here twice and have not been disappointed either time. If you have the chance, take a tour - our tour guide was one of the 2 owners, and the stories he told added greatly to the experience! The food is delicious (sorry, no pictures), especially their sheet of nachos and the street tacos! It is pretty loud, so if you're going for an intimate date, this isn't the place. Can't wait for my next opportunity to visit."}
{"text":"I went there Wednesday evening with my friends when cowboy crusher beer and wings were specials and discounted. We had an ok time until we started paying for our split bill. The hostess had charged us 13 dollars for wings instead of 7 dollars for Wednesday's. She claimed that she rang those 4 orders by mistake and that she had no way to correct for it!!! My friend had already paid for his portion of the bill without paying attention to the details. We decided it is not worth the time discussing it with the manager at that very moment. What made me really unhappy was that the server trashed the bills immediately, not leaving any evidence! We had 4 orders of wings so a mere 24 dollar extra on a 120 dollar total!!  A 20% overcharge."}
{"text":"Best bbq I've had in Canada and great beer to boot. I'm an ipa guy but there pale ale is really worth writing home about."}
{"text":"Excellent burger.  The pale ale is delicious as well.  I will be craving the burger and beer quite often I'm sure.  Service was great and the ambiance was super for a Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"From the ashes of Melrose cafe Trolley 5 was born.  It has this very modern industrial look which creates a very warm and inviting atmosphere.  One of the really great things about the place is they brew there own beer and the few beers I have tried are amazing and a big reason to try this place out.  The food we tried was all very tasty with the BBQ and the nachos being the big hits for every one.  The BBQ is as good as you will get anywhere as in the city. I have been to Trolley 5 three times now twice for lunch and once for evening drinks with friends.  I always found the service amazing and helpful.  I do like the main level bar but the basement houseshoe bar is also amazing that had video screens showing old 90;s music video.  I would suggest talking a stroll and tying some of their fine beers."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, polite and helpful staff, awesome beers and the best ribs ever! Really!! The beer I tried was \"the first crush\" and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"best thing everrree I will definitely come back to calgary to passby this place again.... LOVE IT"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to eat and have some of the micro brews here. I'm a huge micro brew fan and like when I see a place in yyc going in the direction of, let's say Portland, my favorite micro brew and beer town. So here's my impression:  I ordered the classic burger which on first impression was very lacklustre. The veggies on top felt flat with little effort put into making it feel fresh. I had also asked for sans tomato and it came with a big tomato that also didn't have a ton of flavor so I removed it. The meat had a good texture and you could tell that there was some ribeye in there but it was moderately cold unfortunately. I believe my first comment to my friend was \"sorta tastes like Wendy's and Burger King had a burger baby together\".  As for the beer, I got the flight in order to try a few and was disappointed to see that 2 of their (8 I think?) Brews were out and both I really wanted to try. With the ones I did try, I have to say they make a nice IPA and Porter so I'd recommend trying those if you're a fan.   The redemption song in all of this was the service. The  (I assume manager) asked me how I liked my burger and was 100% accommodating in taking it back and adding some extra toppings at my request. Once I tried the $17 version of the $10 burger it was much better and actually hot. They charged me for the 10$ burger and not the extras which was nice enough and what I would expect from a brewpub. Going the extra mile would have meant covering the whole burger but hey...I did like the second one so I was happy to pay.   Overall great service but not totally thrilled with the beer shortage or attention to detail in the food. I think if they had 12 of their own beers on tap and were out of 2 I wouldn't have even shrugged.   I might go back, but I won't be the first of my group to recommend it for anything other than a few drinks before dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time over the weekend .....and I can DIG IT!  I love to people watch - so I was ever so pleased to snag a spot on the upstairs patio. It's so cool to enjoy a meal overlooking the hustle and bustle on 17th avenue... can't wait to do it again!   We had the beer nuts, two chicken burgers, an order of the jalapeno corn and some french fries. The corn was nothing to write home about but we really enjoyed everything else. The beer nuts especially - YUM! The girl who helped us was super friendly and the overall vibe of the place is really welcoming and fun.   I look forward to my next visit. This is great place to hang out."}
{"text":"We were in Calgary and stopped in for a couple of beers. The Porter was incredible, the Pale Ale was very good, and the Black IPA was much better than I would have expected, We also ordered the Salt & Pepper Squid to munch on and it was fantastic. Service was great as well, we sat at the bar and our bartender was awesome... attentive and engaging even though he was extremely busy. It is a very busy, congested spot... loud with a younger crowd. Our only gripe was that it was difficult navigating the crowd to get to the restrooms downstairs. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love it. In fact we had such an amazing first impression that over the course of the next 10 days we went there three times. The only reason one star removed was the last day I called at noon on a Sat and asked for reservation for 4 for 6pm that night and she said fine. I asked if we can be seated NOT next to the front door as its breezy in the draft and she said fine you are sitting upstairs so no problem (HUGE place, its got 3 floors!  And an adorable snaking chain circulating thru all three levels carrying Growler bottles on an old dry cleaner chain drive, custom made, very very unique and fun to watch, Ive never seen anything like it, totally made me remember a cute scene from American Hustle when Christian Bale was smooching his sweetie amidst the dry cleaning bags....)  So we get there on time, no one can find our reservation, 10 minutes to get sorted out, we get seated upstairs in the middle of a bachelor party. I kid you not. Its me and hubby and 2 teen boys surrounded by a huge loud bunch of testosterone filled men and the groom to be dressed in an old discarded wedding dress.  You cant make this stuff up. The room was covered in blue and pink decorations. Finally the manager recognized us (he is REALLY good with faces and names, wow !) and moved us to downstairs. Ill write more when I get a minute and add photos of the incredible food- its UNBELIEVABLE. Especially the smoked turkey that I loved so much I ordered TWICE in one week. Meanwhile up until now I HATE turkey. Im converted :)"}
{"text":"Went here again last night. The beer is pretty good..not outstanding but good. Went with the wings as it was wing night...mistake as they were shrivelled dry skin covered bones. What was the weirdest thing I thought was the service. It was good in that they were efficient and friendly. However..what was really interesting was all the staff looked miserable. I get that work is work but I can't remember the last time I saw a group of people who just seemed to hate where they were. Usually employees joke back and forth etc. Not there. Very weird."}
{"text":"I've been to Trolley a few times so I feel like I have experienced what they have to offer. All in all, experiences were... ok.  First time I went with the girls after work for happy hour and some appies, the service was absolutely horrible. We were there for I think 3ish hours and our server came by 3 times. Once to drop off a round a drinks, once to drop off the food and once to ask if we wanted the bill. We had to flag other girls down to try and get more drinks...   Second time, met a friend there for dinner... the food doesn't blow you away but it isn't bad either, it just reminds me of overly priced pub food and I'm not really a huge fan of their beer but it's ok.   Third and fourth times, same deal really... service wasn't good, beer and food meh. The one thing I do like about this place though is the atmosphere, it's fun and the people that go are also there to have a good time so that saves this place for me."}
{"text":"Well this is probably the coolest brewery I've been to. Right in the heart of 17th Ave (where Melrose was once located).    I had the Trolley burger with yam fries and it was delicious. Served on a platter with fries in a baking dish, the burger was very tasty with a brioche bun and crispy onions.    Next time I'm in Calgary I'll eat here again, and I'll bring my friends."}
{"text":"Came to Trolley 5 on Sunday August 21st approx 7:30pm.  Very busy place but we got seated immediately and luckily got a table on the patio - score - perfect patio weather!!  Quick service.  Waitress did a good job recommending menu items to us (we told her it was our first time).  We ordered the 2 meat BBQ platter $26,  A lot of food, excellent value, and very tasty.  We had the brisket and ribs.  For sides we chose the mac and cheese, coleslaw and an additional order of corn bread.  Server brought over a rack of 5 different sauces - I tried 4 of  [them (didn't try the mustard sauce - just not my thing).  The \"Asian type\" sauce was my favorite.  (Chipotle sauce was just too spicy for my taste).  I will definitely return, and probably have the BBQ plate again, although the menu is large and varied.  The dishes I saw going by our table looked good including the tacos and the pizza.  I would only make 1 recommendation .....  after reading the FaceBook reviews I decided to call for a reservation.  The phone number on the website and the FB page are someone's personal cell phone - and the message does not indicate that it is for Trolley 5.  I called 3 times to try to hear the message properly because I think it was recorded in a very busy and loud kitchen and I just couldn't properly identify who this phone belonged to.  i didn't leave a phone number because I assumed it to be a wrong number.  I would recommend changing the outgoing voice message on that cell phone."}
{"text":"Went for friends and fam night before they officially opened and I was blown away. The interior style of the place is awesome - super cool setting and lots to look at. We were under the understanding that the menu was still a work in progress, so that's what we expected and thought it was pretty good!  Since then, things seem to have taken a turn. Beer quality remains high, which is a plus; but it seems like the chef or kitchen staff have lost their drive or something - food quality has gone down. Disappointing, to say the least. I haven't gone back recently to see if there have been any improvements, so I remain open minded!"}
{"text":"I was there on a weekday for lunch with a large group recently. The building was very cold and the smell from the brewers was very strong which detracted from the food. The food was only mediocre. A bit expensive with pretty small servings for the price.  The steak sandwich was served with a side of slaw as ordered but it was only @ 1/4cup serving for $4. It may be better suited for a drinks only place."}
{"text":"Great beer and service. Lots of seating and a good atmosphere! Happy hour prices are on par"}
{"text":"This spot has it all! Good BBQ, great beers, and all the sports you can watch! Seriously, there's 6 TV's on the first floor! I haven't even ventured to the upstairs or downstairs yet. I particularly love the fact that they're willing to change a TV to college football from that good 'ol hockey game. Gotta see how the college football teams are doing even if I'm 3,000 kilometers away!   The atmosphere is great, it's always a \"hop\"ing  spot. *ba dum chih* since they brew their own beers! Get it? Anyway, gotta try the beer flights here to see what you like. The food is pretty good too. I love how the nachos come out on a huge tray. It can easily feed three people. The beef brisket here is the only spot I've found in calgary that is like brisket from Texas. You gotta try it!   Also gotta mention the trolly of growlers that moves above your head. It's an awesome way to grab your attention to taking some of the great brews home with ya.   Come on a weekend and you went be disappointed. Just make sure you have a reservation or you'll be waiting for awhile."}
{"text":"Update from Mar 2017: The service was !!terrible!! in an inexcusable clumsy way. I came to have a beer on Saturday night but the servers got very confused and brought the wrong order a couple of times, I ended up having water.   They also got the bills mixed up... it was a very bad experience overall...   -:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-  Kudos for the great place. It's a nicely designed space and the actual brewery is amazing! The service is really good too!  I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was good though I think it needs a bit more garnishing. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend's family on a Sunday. Really cool interior and awesome view of the brewery through the glass. But... They were out of almost all of their house beers, which was the main reason we went there. The servers seemed very out of sync as after we ordered our food, they delivered a main dish before we had even received our appetizers. Turns out it was for a different table. When we did get our appetizers, they delivered our mains almost right after. The food wasn't spectacular at all, especially for the price they were charging. We had the tomato basil soup, tasted more like pasta sauce and the portion was huge. The crab, artichoke and kale dip, was not good at all, tasted like a bowl of watery cheese. HOWEVER, the dim sum shrimp dumplings were delicious... Except they charged $12 for 4 dumplings hahaha. I got the beef dip and it was impossible to eat, the bread was so soft that it was falling apart before it made it to my mouth. Was really disappointed. Perhaps wait a few months until they work out the kinks and fix their menu."}
{"text":"Snagged an invite to their grand opening as I had entered their \"name our beer\" contest. Love that they invited people who had entered the contest to their grand opening. Great way to get people who are truly interested out to try something new.  Location is the old Melrose on 17th (the part that has been empty for a really long time). The have a ground and upper level with patio seating on both levels. Downstairs is their brewery, but didn't have a chance to see that. They have done a great job with the decor on the main level and love the growler conveyor belt along the ceiling. The upper level has a raised roof with sky light over the bar making it open and airy and very light. Booth and table seats up their too. Love how this looks, even in winter this will get loads of light. Good job team.  Considering this was an opening and the first time anyone was doing service their team did a great job. Our server, Nicole, gave us a great overview of their beers and made some recommendations food wise as they had appetizers available. Beers were very different to \"tradition\" and a great surprise. I can see myself enjoying their beers again soon. Love that they also have house wine for $6 a glass!  On the food side they had some passed appetizers which we got to try. Cornbread is delightful and moist and not drench in maple as has been the trend for a while. Steak bites, were the meat from their steak sandwich and the chimichurri sauce that came with it was on point - good steak just cooked past medium.   They also had a pulled pork slider station and a brisket slider station set up. Pulled pork is flavorful and slaw with it had a mild sauce that didn't overpower. Choice of 5 different bbq sauces to try and all are very good. The brisket is... fantastic! Not sure what they use in the rub before the roasting starts but it is delightful and makes the brisket slightly addictive... mouth is watering just thinking about it.  We also ordered the shrimp dumplings off the menu to try. Due to their being a million people in the room by then and ordering food I expect the kitchen was slightly overwhelmed. Our dumplings came out being steamed a little too long so the rice paper wrapping was more sticky than it should have been. Expected to be disappointed in taste, but they must steam the dumplings over a broth because the wrappers all had a lot of flavour in them and even overcooked were excellent. If your dumplings taste great overcooked you know on a regular night they will be a hit!  Trolley 5, I am really impressed. You have done a great job working on your menu to make sure everything is great. You have trained your servers incredibly well. I will be back and will be bringing my friends. Thanks for invite to your opening day and see you again soon."}
{"text":"Went to this place as stampede was beginning and the service was not ideal. Anything we asked for was out of stock until the next server came along and said that it was actually in stock. Seems like there was some kinks to work out with the whole stampede staffing plan. Hopefully they have figured things out since then. Signs indicating where the bathroom is would be helpful as well."}
{"text":"I've been to Trolley 5 a couple of times now and I really  LOVE it. I'm disappointed to give it 4 stars but I had to take one away for an event i recently held there that was not up to par.   First, the manager there is amazing. He always makes a point of talking to his customers and making sure they are having a good time. The wait staff is also amazing. They are quick and friendly. The food is pretty decent and the actual look of the place is pretty great.   On Mondays they have $3 Pints and $7 ribs. The ribs were super delicious and well... $3 pints are self explanatory.   Now the only thing I have an issues with (And why I won't have another event there) is that I was told our group would have Audio/ Visual set up and I made it clear we do presentations to our member base when booking. When we arrived for our meeting we were told that there was no audio, that visual only worked if we had mac products, and we were put into the downstairs bar by the brewery where it was incredibly loud. No-one could hear our guest speaker.   I'll go again for drinks and food but I'd skip doing future events with them."}
{"text":"We went in with a group of friends. We were downstairs on the bottom floor since we had a group of more than 15. The area is much nicer than when it was Melrose, but the low ceiling gives it a bit of a cramped feeling. Regardless, being downstairs worked great for our group since we weren't bothered with as much noise and music is if we had been upstairs. Our server and the bartender were amazing; super friendly and knowledgeable. Brad, our bartender, took us on a quick brewery tour and knew all about the beer and the brewing process. We were allowed separate checks and the server told each person that gratuity was included. I've encountered a lot of places that don't mention that. I'm sorry I can't remember our servers name but she was great.  The overall place is very nice and relaxed. The second floor is nice and allows for great people watching along 17th ave. The third floor is nice and large with a unique look. The entire front opens up on nice days to let in lots of fresh air and make you feel like there's a patio on the third floor as well.  The food was a little disappointing I'm afraid. We had the Tuesday special which was the $10 burger. The patty was a little dry and not bursting with flavor but it was decent. I wouldn't wan tto pay more than $10 for it. I had the mac & cheese as my side and it was quite bland. I think someone stole my flavor for it! They do have some good side dish options and our server tried to make it better which was greatly appreciated. It was mentioned that the mac & cheese is hit & miss there so we obviously got a miss that night. The quesadilla looked really good and I'm told the beef dip was tasty.   They brew their own beer and I was able to try most of them. All very enjoyable.  All in all, I will definitely be returning, maybe not for a burger but definitely the friendly staff, cold beer and overall feel of the place."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were just ok, nothing special. Not a big beer drinker though so did not have any of the beers."}
{"text":"This was really disappointing after all the hype around it. The food was really bad, I was out with four friends and 3 of us couldn't finish the meal because it was cheap, dried out, low quality food. The manager was nice about getting us something else but even the replacement snacks weren't great. What's good beer if you don't have good food to go with it? Skip this place and head to Clive burger, the coup or even McDonald's. Very crowded table set up and just no worth your money."}
{"text":"I went here a few weekends ago- haven't been there since it was Melrose. Overall, I'd say it was OK-like many other craft beer places I found it was overpriced, Service at the bar was actually quite slow at times, and I didn't really find the bartenders really to be that friendly. The only reason I'm really giving it three stars is because one of the managers there was really great and accommodating at helping us find room to sit and once we finally were able to sit the waitress was actually very nice. I think there's better places to go in Calgary but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"So my first impression is, cute venue great location but I probably won't go back until until they work out all the kinks. So here's the thing, we went on a Tuesday for lunch after their grand opening and They were pretty much out of everything! Most of the beers on tap, ran out of soup (before 12:30pm), no bacon (which was supposed to be on the burger). Our server was pretty bad as well, she got our orders all wrong and the manager didn't do anything to compensate for the mistake.   Food was mediocre bar food. The burgers were super sloppy and messy to eat.   Here's the kicker, we got the beer special for the day which was supposed to be $5 but on the bill we were charged something else. By then, my party was pretty fed up, we just paid the bill and GTFO."}
{"text":"I when to Trolley 5 with my kids and met up with a couple and there two children on Sunday at noon.  The brunch menu was awesome. I had the eggs benny and my kids enjoyed the Delicious BBQ ribs and briskets. The potatoes that came with my bennies was truly made in house and was awesome.  The service was very fun and the server was very knowledgeable about the beer and all the menu items.  The brewery restaurant look incredible, we could see all the brewery equipment in action, this was so interesting.  We went for a quick look around the building and it was fantastic, the second floor Calgary's indoor patio was stunning and a breath air for a restaurant!  This is a five thumbs up and I would go back again for sure!"}
{"text":"We had our work Christmas party totaling over 50 people at Trolley 5.  We had a portion of the upper level, and I have to say because of these guys the event went super smoothly and we had a ton of fun. The atmosphere is great, food was delicious, the drinks kept coming, the music was on point, and the staff were super friendly. This was my first time here and I am definitely hanging out here when I come downtown in the future. Having dealt with a couple other venues in the past I'm definitely going recommend these guys to my friends for any future events."}
{"text":"There were so many amazing dinner options in Calgary that it was hard to choose just one! Luckily, thanks to a suggestion from our hotel and Yelp we decided to try out Trolley 5. Trolley 5 is a massive brewpub with tons of seating and a menu with something to please everyone. When we walked up to the hostess the first floor and outdoor area was absolutely packed, but she was able to seat us upstairs no problem. We also snagged a great half outdoors spot by the open second floor window.   There are plenty of beers to try and we went with the white IPA which was refreshing and delicious. For eats I had the chicken tacos which came with a massive order of three that were stuffed to the brim with chicken, pico de gallo and cheese. Flavorful and delicious! My fiance ordered a two meat combo plate with brisket, pulled pork and sides of cole slaw and poutine. He was very pleased with his meal and finished every bite. He especially loved the caddy of various sauces that was brought over to the table.   Although Calgary has a ton of restaurants, I'd be tempted to revisit Trolly 5 when / if I find myself in Calgary again. For now, I'll urge you to try it if you find yourself in the area."}
{"text":"Checked this place out tonight with my boyfriend and two friends. We planned to have a night out for food and drinks.   However, I probably won't come back anytime soon. Wasn't very impressed that they ran out of everything.. Like beers and cocktails. The waitress said that they were able to make basic Mojitos, Caesar's, and other cocktails.. Was hoping to order a Mojito but they ran out of mint? So I stuck with water since the options for beer and cocktails were very limited. Which is pretty disappointing.   Their Sunday special was all you can eat bbq.. And our waitress told us to just ignore all the specials (I guess they ran out or something). The specials she offered us was a Pulled Pork Sandwich, which we ended up ordering. It wasn't great. It was very bland and missing sauce so the sandwich was very dry.   We ordered the nachos which was OKAY but over cooked.   When we finally decided to order more mains the waitress told us that they stopped serving mains and that we were only able to order appetizers and pizza. We asked when did they stop serving mains and why it wasn't mentioned to us til now (10:02pm) she said that they stopped at 10:00pm and that someone was supposed to tell us right when we got seated.. Which didn't happen. The waitress was very rude when that happened and snapped at us.  She did check with the kitchen to see if we were able to order our mains, and they made an exception.   My friend ordered the Mac and cheese $14 and I ordered a side of Mac and cheese $4 .. And let's just say if you're going to order the Mac and cheese, save yourself the extra $10 and just order the side. When the two came out, the portions were the same size, just different plating.   I won't be returning anytime soon. I wanted a night out with my friends.. Where we can enjoy the food, drinks and company of eachother  But the food was mediocre and the selection on both food and drinks were very limited."}
{"text":"I'm not entirely sure I've come to terms with a multi-level brew pub existing in Calgary yet. I've been, I've enjoyed food and I've enjoyed beers - many, many beers. What a grand eve it was. Thinking back to the Melrose days, my oh my, Calgary, how far we've come.  I'm calling it now - I think Trolley 5 has what it takes to become THE spot in Calgary. With two levels of south facing patios and walls that open the full distance, Trolley 5 will mix up a group beer hall hangout session with some sunshine and 17th Ave people watching on the nice days, and in winter will be a warm and cozy brew pub the will still let in the sunshine from the few hours of daylight we'll have.  If you feel like getting your beer nerd on, downstairs is where you need to be. It's quieter so pull of a seat at the bar - their basement bartenders (maybe all the bartenders, can't confirm) really know their stuff! Being the hot day that it was, I fell in love with their First Crush White IPA which they say \"like your first crush, this beer is unforgettable.\" Pretty true, I'd say - but what they forget to mention  is that enough of these will definitely aid in you forgetting everything else. I mean, I know I ate here twice throughout the evening. Pretty sure I went with the Cobb Salad for lunch and stayed through until a Kentucky burger  (buttermilk fried chicken, back bacon, pepper jack, avocado) for dinner. I liked them both. I wish I could give you a more detailed review on this portion of the evening, but First Crush says otherwise.  I went on opening day and managed to snag a free tour. They're typically $15, but come with a flight and a pint... so basically if you're committed to drinking $15 worth of beer you get a free tour. It's definitely worth it to get to know the brewery and hear their stories on the beer. Craft beer is exactly that - a craft, and they're happy to share it with you. Their craft and their beer.  The Growler train is a tonne of fun to watch going around. Plus, growler fills are only $12. I'll be making a bicycle trip for some takeaway soon!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Service is always good. Happy hour prices are awesome. $4 for a beer? The environment is lively and great if you are looking to do some people watching on 17th Ave. I enjoyed the Hef, but didn't like any of the other beers I tried. It's a bit annoying that the restaurant is always out of beers that I want to try. I tried a chicken burger and a pulled pork sandwich. The food is okay, small portion though and average in taste."}
{"text":"'A bit disappointing' is what I told my co-worker, Ernie, when he asked me how my night was at Trolley 5.  I came here with Seano and a group of other friends on Saturday night anticipating a good night after some positive reviews from other friends. First off, the food was delicious - I had the Fried Chicken burger and smashed it down and all my friends meals looked good too.  What let the place down was the service - a couple of us had already finished our first drink and were onto a second before others had even received their first one and this was a trend that continued through out the night. People were constantly without a drink for a good 10-15 minutes at a time.  Also, for a brewery they didn't have about 2-3 of the main beers on tap and the ones they did have weren't the best tasting. Seano couldn't even finish his second pint and had to move on to ceasers and he'll drink any kind of beer.  So all in all, good food but poor service and beer. Atmosphere, setting, price etc. are all decent."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this past weekend. As usual when you are at a restaurant- lets begin with discussing drinks. My first drink was a cesar and it was mediocre. Not the best cesar I have ever had but also not the worst. For my second drink I got a glass of Sangria. When I ordered it I asked for a glass of white sangria but the waitress told me that they do not do red or white sangrias and rather just a rose sangria. I thought I would try it because I never had before besides a rose slush summer drink at Cactus club and the rose was not good- at least the way they made it. Maybe some people would like it if you like grapefruit or grapefruit juice but that is what it was mixed with so it was very tart and I do not like grapefruits so therefore I did not like the drink.  In addition, the food was just average and nothing special. I found my food quite dry so it was nice that it came with about 5 different BBQ sauces including white BBQ sauce, Carolina BBQ sauce, etc. but I also wasn't a fan of the BBQ sauces either.  Might have to give this place another try but we will see. I do like the location and atmosphere though :)  January After having written my previous review about Trolley 5, management contacted me and asked me to come back to give it another try so I did. I still did not enjoy it or the sauces and this is still not what I would come back for if I were to ever come back again.   Saturday June 23rd, 2018 Recently went here while on a pub crawl on 17th avenue. Trust me it wouldn't be my first choice of a place to go on 17th but because I was in a group of 10 I obviously had to go.  They gained 1 star because I had the daily jerky which is just five dollars and the flavour of the daily jerky was pineapple siraccha and it was actually pretty good so that is why they went from one star to two."}
{"text":"We did a brewery tour for my bachelor party over Stampede weekend. Ernie did (literally) the best brewery tour we have ever been to - not just \"look at my nice equipment\", but his actual thinking and problems they have faced. It was candid, open, honest and, most importantly, hilarious. We have been on many many many brewery tours around the world, and this was by far our favourite. The beer was great! After the tour, we got a flight of beer and some lunch. The lunch was AMAZING. The food is absolutely fantastic, and the beer selection is awesome. Ernie even put us on the guest list on a Saturday night during Stampede, his cell # and had a table ready for our group ready as soon as we arrived. I really wish Yelp could give more stars, because this was one of the staples of our trip. We lucked out big time. This place deserves all of its success, it truly is amazing!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch. I had the chicken and waffles sandwich and it was delicious! A massive piece of fried chicken, bacon, egg, and cheese sandwhiched between two big waffles. Needless to say this was difficult and to eat (i used a knife and fork) and very filling. My boyfriend loved the bbq brisket and egg sandwhich. We also had yummy mimosas for $6 and the service was fast and efficient."}
{"text":"First time, not from Calgary. Busy Friday night and we still got great service from Kailey!  Limited menu after 11:00pm however the mushroom pizza is somehow ridiculously out of this world! Their craft brews are amazing and drink service is surprisingly quick based on how busy they are. Also tried the nachos; very nice, good even toppings and the fresh salsa is perfection. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I think they're still struggling with getting the seating worked out. Tables make the place a little hard to manoeuvre. The wait staff trip over the rules on occasion (e.g. can a kid be on the patio?)  The beer is uniformly good. What I had of the food was tasty though I haven't yet eaten a meal there. The staff are very accommodating and pleasant. The space is very nicely done up. They have lots of other people's taps and beers.  This will be a better review once some of these initial glitches are smoothed out."}
{"text":"What a great space, especially on a sunny day ( when we so sparingly get sun this summer). Front doors are like garage doors that open onto 17th Ave. Its in the old Melrose location which was made excellent for gathering for beers and snacks a decade ago. Trolley 5 is no different. A little bit new concept for a pub with inhouse smoked meat of all kinds and jerky as their specialty. We started with house pickles, warms nuts and beef jerky while we waited for our group.. and sampled the Pale Ale that was on special for $5.  They had well priced wine that we got into for $36 (pinot grigio) and some group natchos which were huge. They could have used more cheese and larger salsa bowl but it was still delish. You know when you have a chip festival of goodness and the bowl of salsa is so small you need a spoon -dipping just isnt the option?! ok well perhaps i like my condiments too much of this doesnt resinate with you.  We were quite full after snacks, beer and natchos we we just split the calamari which was crispy and delish. Overall great place and we will be back. Suitable for bringing a date or boys. Its not a place where they are subjected to girl food or small portions. My only con was they didnt have our reservation which proved stressful for a moment when there was 5 all coming to meet. In the end they found a spot for us... not the res. and we had a lovely waitress (new)) that couldnt have  been more accomodating. Yeah!!"}
{"text":"I went for dinner and a beer and I was not disappointed. The house beer was very tasty, perfect for a warm day. I got the roasted turkey wrap with cranberry aioli. It was amazing, the cranberry aioli complimented it well. I got the California salad as a side and the blood orange vinaigrette was to die for. Overall great service and great atmosphere, nice and open."}
{"text":"Bar upstairs looks great. Service not so good. Food is average pub food."}
{"text":"3.5 but feeling generous.  Service was great.  Beer was good i guess.  I feel like you'd be better sticking to the styles that are available all the time rather than the one offs.  The one off that my friend has wasn't drinkable.  Burger was great, too big to bite."}
{"text":"Kicking ass! These guys have made a great location even better. Very excited to see how things turn out here. Try the burger!"}
{"text":"Busy during stampede week. Great eye candy. Good list of beers but many were out, which were surprising."}
{"text":"Awesome beer, great food and the different rooms make you feel like you belong here.  I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Tried the Cranberry Wit and the Blueberry, both were pretty decent beers.   Otherwise though, we didn't get much of a chance to sample their beer selection today, for some reason they were out of most beers.  The Pot of Pickles was a variety of pickled veg, including beets, green beans, asparagus, garlic and cucumbers. I really liked it but my hubby was expecting just standard pickles."}
{"text":"Opening day,  the place was packed!  Our servers were great, but we had to wait for drinks multiple times, a manager saw this and came over right away and hooked us up,  not only with another round but with appies.  It was a very cool gesture. I loved sitting on the patio,  they have a variety of seating options there... Low tables, high tops, bar, etc. Lost a star for the wings. They are super tiny, like seriously tiny. It made me feel bad eating them... Went back Sat night and the place once again was packed. I think this place will do ok,  great layout for mingling.  Music was spot on."}
{"text":"Best customer service of all-time!! Excellent food too.  We had mushroom pizza and a BBQ plate."}
{"text":"Fantastic addition to 17th Avenue.    When Melrose disappeared, there was a bit of a vacuum on the streets of Calgary.  Luckily, Trolley 5 came along and made it all better. Extensive beer selection. The food isn't bad either!  The BBQ ribs were delish.  Love the open concept.  Cheers to many great memories here at Trolley 5."}
{"text":"Great poutine and decent poke. Probably not the best poke I have had but it's pretty good. Although I will say I got great service and I loved the atmosphere and decor inside."}
{"text":"The bar itself is nice with big windows that open to let in fresh air.  The sandwich that I had was decent, but the salad was sopping wet with dressing.  However, the biggest disappointment was the drink selection.  They were out of at least one of their own beers.  Then, they had a list of maybe 10 or 12 rotating taps and they were out of at least 3 of them.  Every time I ordered, the waitress would say that she was either out of something or had to check if she was out of it and would ask me what my second choice was if they were out.  It is an annoying an inefficient system.  If you constantly have this problem, then maybe instead of printing out little sheets of paper with the rotating taps and paper clipping them into the menus, you should get some sort of board on the wall that can be easily changed when you run out."}
{"text":"I have only come here for drinks the many times I have gone. The ambience is great and the people watching from the patio is FANTASTIC. I have always received really great service and the people you meet there are really interesting and typically fun. I have yet to peg the type of crowd that hangs there. It is such a mix and seems to change every time I am there.  I am not the biggest fan of their drink selections (beerwise) and their margaritas are not delicious at all. But that being said you can always stick to a classic high ball to get the job done ;)"}
{"text":"Arrived at about 6:40 pm on a Friday night and thought we might have to wait in line - the host allowed us in as long as we didn't mind sitting at the bar. We sat upstairs at the bar (I think that's the best) and then were offered seats facing onto the street on a warm summer night. Perfect people watching perch and the windows were open so it felt like being a on a deck.  We loved that the server (Abby - she was fabulous) offered us samples before choosing our drinks. My husband had beer and I had wine. We just ordered snacks (not a full dinner) and everything we had was excellent. The caprese salad was new to the menu and we loved it. We had the tuna poke and the half order of ribs too. I've never had ribs like that - rubbed with spice and dry with an excellent dipping sauce. I think they are the best I've had (but I'm not a fan of the pulled ribs smothered in sauce so these were a great surprise).  We liked the funky decor (cool blend of cinder block, lots of wood, high ceilings, plenty of light upstairs) and the service was excellent. As we left we heard people talking about needing to wait an hour to get in and I understand why. We'll be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for really good beer at a reasonable price I think this is one of the best places in Calgary.   Great big patio, good vibe, cool music. For me, it's a nice change of pace from some of the pub/beerhall chains that are all over.   One thing that sticks out is the exceptional customer service. Any server I've had has been really great and the managers go way above and beyond. Always a good experience here. Only downside is it is sometimes too busy to get in!"}
{"text":"The gentleman that showed us to our table suggested the breakfast poutine....We went with it and it was awesome!!!!!"}
{"text":"I entered Trolley 5's \"name our beer\" contest and got invited to their soft opening/media preview night tonight.  They've taken over a third of Melrose's old location and turned it into a three floor restaurant and beer brewing extravaganza. The front of the building opens right up on the main floor so even though you didn't get a seat on the small patio, most of the main floor will have a patio/open air sort of feeling.  The basement, which they call their tap room has a more intimate approach. There's a horseshoe shaped bar, a line of booths on one wall, and a couple of bar-height tables for groups of 8. The ceilings are low, the lighting is dark, and the only music you hear is from the main floor.  I tried their three beers that they had on tap. It was my first time trying a white IPA and it was an excellent mix of styles. The service was excellent as the staff were very attentive at making sure we had some of the free samples and that our glasses were full.  So far so good Trolley 5."}
{"text":"Excellent service!  Ordered wings and they were a bit salty. It happens.  However, the waitress was quick to apologize (sincerely!), offered to replace it (which we told her would not be necessary as we had brushed off the excess salt and eaten most of it), then she brought it to the attention of her manager (who apologized and offered to replace it - again we told him it was not necessary). The manager came back to our table around 5 minutes later and told us the wings had been removed from the tab.  We have all been to other restaurants where mistakes are made and apologies given.  At times, they may have even removed the item from the bill.  What stood out at this establishment was the sincerity, the initiative in righting the situation.  They genuinely cared. What was evident was that customer service was not lip service, it is the culture.  Refreshing. Beyond the service, the ambience is great! The energy in the air makes you want to stay a while (and we did!). We also enjoyed our drinks. It was my first time at Trolley 5, but it is now my new fave pub in Calgary.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I used to work late downtown and Trolley 5 seems always be the go to nowadays! Caesars and any of their beers are great (yes we've tried them all haha) Trying to think of just one or two great items is impossible because after trying everything from their route 5 loaded nachos to their cobb salad, to their fried chicken burger you literally can't go wrong. If you need to indulge the mac and cheese is a must. Very excited to go back and try the donair pizza they have. Great spot to enjoy at any time of day."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 4 rather than a 3 because the service, prices, and ambience trumped the food. The beer was quite good, but a little too hoppy for my liking. We did end up taking a growler home to enjoy the Conductor Lager and it was good. The food was mediocre. We went for brunch and I wasn't blown away with the breakfast tacos. It's a pretty simple dish that didn't have anything very exciting with it. A nice avocado cream sauce or refried beans would be tasty.   Now, the ambiance, service, and prices were great! I made a reservation requesting a high chair and it was there waiting. My party consisted of 6 adults and 5 kids under 7. The staff was great in accommodating us by putting us in the back area so the kids could play and run around! It's always nice to find a local restaurant that is accommodating families with young children, because guess what? We like to go out too! The pricing was great also. I find it ridiculous when restaurants charge you an arm and a leg for a cup of coffee or tea, but here it was $2.75 for each and the coffee was bottomless. And he service was also great. Our sever was very patient with our group and always had a smile on her face when she came to the table. It is experiences like these that will bring me back. And although the food was mediocre, I won't hold that against the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Although they didnt have some drinks I wanted to try on tap. The food was awesome and service was great. Definitely try the beef brisket if you can get a seat in here."}
{"text":"Trolley 5 has some seriously tasty beers. We came after dinner to watch the game and grab a couple pints. Sat at the bar and Chantel gave us stellar service. Her beer knowledge was out of this world. She was friendly and attentive. When we weren't quite sure what to have for our second pint, unprompted she brought us tasters of what she thought we would like which was much appreciated. We met the manager, Cory, as we wanted to pass on our compliments regarding Chantel's service.I think folks are quicker to complain to a manager but you should pass on compliments too! He was just as nice and even gave us a card for 2 for 1 brunch. We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"We came here Friday around 4:30 and a group of 5  for their happy hour. Our server was super friendly and even got our names and remembered them throughout the evening . The only thing was , there were a few silly mistakes. We ordered some wings with our drinks because we were starving and it took forever to even come so we assumed she just forgot and didn't bother asking her about them. We never ended up getting them. When the fifth person from our group came (she was a little late) our server took another 10-15 minutes to even ask her if she wanted a drink. She also took a really long time to even ask us if we wanted to order food. When our food finally came and we were already there an hour and 15 min one of the orders were wrong and had to be sent to kitchen to get the right sides with the dish. The food was really good all our friends agreed on  , especially the brisket but the fries were drenched in salt so they could have gone easy on the salt."}
{"text":"We called on a Saturday to see if we were allowed to bring our 5 month old baby and they were more than okay with that.  They suggested we make a reservation though because after 2 they get pretty busy.    Upon arriving we were given a table at the back of the restaurant where there was no one, it was quiet and perfect for our little guy.  They seem to put all the families with young kids there as a few more people with infants showed up as well.   We had heard lots of complaints about the service being poor at this place, but we did not experience that at all.  The floor manager even stopped by a few times to check in on us and gave us the suggestion that if we get our food to go that we should ask for some brioche buns to have it with when we get home - awesome idea!  Our server was friendly and polite, and sometimes a bit out of it - but it definitely wasn't poor service.   To start we had the assorted pickles - it had onions, pickles, jalapenos and mushrooms - super yummy.  We had a few beers and shared the meat platter for 4 - which was more than enough meat for 4 people!   We will definitely return for their seasonal beer release and to try more menu items."}
{"text":"Not good...not good at all. The service was good, but for the prices being charged, I would expect a much higher level of execution on the quality of the food.   We ordered the BBQ Platter, and while the sausage was good, it was overshadowed by the dry chicken, dry pork, and poorly prepared brisket. There was no smoke flavor on the food, and it appeared to have been prepared in the oven and not a smoker.   The dessert was also lacking flavor. The gelato was excellent, but not produced in house. The cobbler and buckle were lacking flavor and while visually appealing, were disappointing flavor wise.   I won't go back. Great location, but there are many other places with great beer and better quality of food."}
