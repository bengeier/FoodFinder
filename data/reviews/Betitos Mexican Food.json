{"text":"If you don't open till 8 then don't put that you open at 6am on your website and on your door. We rode our bikes all the way there and it's closed. So frustrating"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place since it has changed owners. I went through the drive thru, I ordered a machacca breakfast burrito. So when I got to the window to pay, I seriously had to wait 5 min before they would even come to the window to take my money. I wasn't sure if they even took my order. Anyway, then appeared a 10-12 year old kid obviously working the counter and drive thru. I have no problem with giving kids jobs/ or family members but I felt sorry for him for having to deal with it all! He was very sweet and polite but seriously? My burrito was good but the red salsa was way too salty and by that I mean.. I think someone accidentally dumped the the whole salt container. I love yo support mom and pop places but not when they manage like this"}
{"text":"Great staff!  Clean, and YuM-o! $1 tacos on Tuesday's!  Can't beat that!!! The fish tacos are delish!  I've turned my whole office on to them!  Great family owned spot!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito around. Love the campeon and the patron burritos. Top notch good price"}
{"text":"amazingly great, love love the food. I highly recomend...you will absolutely enjoy their food."}
{"text":"This place has really good carne asada fries but.. They are really expensive considering it's just mean fries and cheese with the Guac sour cream and pico. We got the carne asada fries for 12.00 and then two chicken tacos... The tacos had barely any meat in them and were not that awesome.. The rice seemed like someone spilt salt in them and I asked for extra green sauce and the person helping me told me I could only have one green and one red .. Wish they were nicer and not so expensive I'll just stick to fillibertos from now on..."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie I've drove past this place a few times and haven't scene a soul. Said screw it I'm gonna try it and I'm glad there's a taco shop with flavor since the other last taco shops. Filabertos is so bland. And this one has great burritos and tortillas. Breakfast burrito, bean and cheese burrito, carne asada burrito were really good. Staff was very nice and friendly. Will be back again. Hope the word gets out on this place."}
{"text":"If you want authentic, delicious Mexican food this is it! The staff is very friendly too"}
{"text":"Yayyyyyyy! I just moved from Tempe to Gilbert and was so sad I wasn't near Betito's anymore and then we randomly drove by and they were opening right down the street from us in Gilbert. Thank you thank you thank you! I reviewed this place in more detail for the Tempe location if you want to see what I wrote before. Staff is the same at this location, they are so nice and treat me like family. They have great food in quality, taste, and value. This location will wow you inside- it was surprising how fun the decor was inside and they do offer a drive thru.   I like everything on the menu- breakfast burritos: bacon, chorizo, and steak are what I usually order.  Carne asada is always good, tacos, burritos, I haven't had anything I don't like.   I'll be honest, the thing that makes me drool for this place is their dark red hot sauce. OMG it is seriously sooooo good! My husband loves the green which is delish too, a bit more spicy, but the red is just mmm mmm mmm so good!  Try it and enjoy! :-)"}
{"text":"THE NEW KING IN TOWN!! i used to love eating at filbertos! but when i compare their  food to Betitos,  you can totally taste the difference and authenticity! Betitos smells better taste better, and even looks better than los favs or any other Mexican restaurant! this place has now became my secret little spot for the best Mexican food in town! i trust the staff with my food here. compared to the other places they are very clean, fast professional and friendly! and they all speak english so no misunderstandings here. they always get it right the first time! its in a prime location in downtown gilbert if your ever in the area you NEED to try the food. i don't. trust any other Mexican restaurant!  my personal favorite is the carne asada burrito! oh my god with the green salsa I'm about to go right now and pick one up!  they have outdoor seating so you can get some fresh air while you eat, the town of gilbert needed an AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant, the rest are just generic brand names that are well known. this place has a huge potential and i proudly support my local Betitos, they work hard and make the customers feel appreciated. If you live in gilbert you should only trust Betitos to get the REAL Mexican food. the rest are just wannabes come here and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Betitos is a wonderful family owned and operated Mexican eatery with a drive-thru. My husband and I frequent Betitos usually for Taco Tuesday - which is such a great deal ($1 for huge delicious tacos). Shredded beef tacos from Betitos are the best. We recently have tried the pozole on their new menu and it was flawless (I'm quite the pozole connoisseur). It was full of meat & hominy - none of those big bones that the other restaurants use, so it was very easy to eat without getting messy. Thanks Betitos for the great food & service!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight after a long day and got fab tacos. Had been told to LuLus for a long time but ended up here.  Ordered fish tacos and was helped by a very nice younger no older than 9/10 years old.  Got home and realized they need to advertise Fish Stick Tacos. My boyfriend said our kids could have made better tacos.  I will be finding LuLus Tacos tomorrow!  Only getting one star because I had to and the green salsa was good."}
{"text":"The best quesadilla and green salsa I have ever had! The owners are super friendly and the food is all great get the adobada."}
{"text":"This is good food. I had the chicken chimichunga meal. It was BOSS. My wife had two carne asada tacos (I'm sure that it's spelled wrong). We are both full and very happy with the food. It's a very small place that is clearly family owned, grandpa is in the dining area, mom and dad are in the kitchen, and the kids are all there too. I felt welcome and not at all intimidated by the huge menu because they have a picture for everything dish. This is my new go to place for awesome Mexican food, that is well priced, delicious and filling."}
{"text":"I went for taco Tues. and was very disappointed. The fish tacos had overly fried fish sticks in them. The chicken tacos must have had canned chicken in them. The ground beef tacos had a lot of black stuff in them. I wondered if it was ground up black beans. The tables and benches outside were very dirty. Who knows when the last time they were wiped off. .I hoped I wouldn't get sick from the food and lack of cleanliness.I definately would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food yet. We were in town thought we try somewhere different. Carne Assad very salty, my first bite had pico de gallo. But after that it was only salty meat. My grand baby had a cheese crisps,with only to find cheese just in the middle only. We ordered our food but no where clean to sit. Tables were dirty and some still had leftover plates with food still on them. I guess they weren't happy either. Then we asked for napkins. They had none. They ran out. What restaurant runs out? Not going there again even if it's free. Favoritos is the best for us."}
{"text":"I thought the food was decent. What pissed me off was a .75 cent debit card transaction fee. Come on man! Cost of doing business people. Are u gonna charge me for salsa too? Its 2015 guys. Plus it doesn't cost 75 cents for a merchant for a typical  debit charge so they are ripping people off. Way to guys....  Never again..."}
{"text":"Just went here and got beef tacos and a shrimp taco. I will have to say the food was amazing. The person who took my order was really friendly, like he cared. I normally go to Filibertos for my taco fix, but this place is soooooooo much better. Even the hot sauce they give you was amazing, like they put in effort to make it. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I based this review on being compared to a Filiberto's.   I ordered the carne asada chimichanga.  I don't think Filiberto's has an option for this.   This crispy deep fried burrito came on a bed of lettuce with the typical dressings you can find at any similar establishment. It came with pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole. I ordered this Togo.   When I first opened it up you can really smell the freshness of it. I wasn't sure how good this would be since there doesn't seem to be a lot of customers at that time but it really was good. The chimichanga was crispy and the carne asada was really good. I'm going to definitely be back to try just the burrito and instead of deep fried as well just to really compare. I loved the jalape√±o in the pico as well. Compared to Filiberto's this food was definitely an upgrade.   Why the 4 stars instead of 5?  A few things: 1.  Cleanliness - I came through the drive thru at night and it really can be a little sketchy even though it's Gilbert. There were random buckets and a table right by where you order. In addition it looks like the cook was handling the cash register as well and I highly doubt he was washing his hands between grabbing everything and cooking. I guess this type of establishment it is expected though.   2.  I hate establishments who charge $.75 for the use of plastic. Yes it's typically a sign that it's a mom and pop shop but ugghh it's a pet peeve.   3. The cashier asked what type of salsa I wanted and through yelp I saw that the green salsa was pretty good. Unfortunately they forgot this. Also, this was a chimichanga and they only included a fork and no knife. That's annoying.   I'll be back! I love supporting mom and pop shops and this place seems to have good enough food to try it out if you're looking for a Filiberto's alternative."}
{"text":"The place smells a tad mildewy which is not appetizing so we ate outside on a windy cool day. The food is much like Filbertos. Good for what it is."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to having a great Mexican neighborhood restaurant in this location. Extremely disappointed with our huevos rancheros. So so salty couldn't even finish. Beans would be excellent  if salt were reduced. Rice okay but again salted to the max. And my hubby felt the same, and he is one to always reach for the salt shaker."}
{"text":"Used to be really, really good, however tonight, I am swayed, not by taste of food, but for lack of service. Sent my kids get food carneasada fries, but was turned away by the child helper due to not wanting to prepare it anymore. Now that is sad, I used to really love this place, but refusing to cook, and that is your method of earning money. You have lost my business forever."}
{"text":"So glad Betitos moved in after Fusion died a long torturous death. The tortillas here are sooo good. I've only had their veggie burrito, but I consider that a pretty good indicator of the quality of a taco shop's food. SO usually gets their rolled tacos. We'll be doing our part to keep them in business. Get the hot salsa, it'll grow hair on ya."}
{"text":"Only eat here if you like tasty Mexican food served quickly by a friendly employee at a good price."}
{"text":"What you need to know is: They have phenomenal prices, delicious tacos, and HUGE quesadillas -- Bigger than your face size! There is always enough food to eat now and plenty to save for later. They are quick, fast, and friendly. Driving can kind of be a mess around downtown Gilbert, especially on Friday nights. Be sure to keep an eye out, the turn in to the resturant can easily be missed."}
{"text":"I had a delicious breakfast burrito.  The owner was very nice.  I recommend this Mexican restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"ordered: - nothing  pros: - interior is nicely decorated  cons: - dirty plates and stainless steel bowl in the dining room [hopefully they werent prepping salsa in that lol] - no restroom - prices were above average when compared to other mexican restaurants - one person in front of me, stood in line for 10 mins without a greeting, cashier afk? - when a cook finally popped out, i was completely ignored so i dipped"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant and I am glad that I rolled the dice to stop. When I bit into the Breakfast burrito, carne asada burrito , and chicken taco I knew I had a new Mexican joint that is much closer to my home. We have a new champion!"}
{"text":"I used to pick up nachos once in a while from El Pollo Loco and thought they were the best I'd be able to find at a drive through fast food joint.  Then I tried the nachos at Filberto's and thought they were infinitely better.  THEN one day I tried the ones at Betitos, and those are my new standard for greatness!  They're amazing!  It's also hard not to love anything that comes in their delicious tortillas.  There are still a couple things on the menu I like better at Filberto's, so my recommendation - go to both places, order everything on the menu, and enjoy the process of discovery. ;)"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast burritos in Gilbert! The tortillas are great and the red sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"I love greasy Mexican food. That being said, this was not particularly good greasy Mexican food. The side of chips was burned, and the beans tasted like they came from a can. The carne asada tacos did have a nice flavor. I would put this restaurant on par with any of the bertos around town. It's probably just what the doctor ordered after a night out drinking."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place and it was well worth it. I had their super nachos and breakfast burrito. Both were very good!! The food wasn't greasy and their tortillas are the best around-not dry and flaky but moist and tasty!!! Give them a try!!!!"}
{"text":"Had to come by again to try out some crunchy tacos. Was praying that they made them like Rienda's but sadly it was not to be. The shredded beef was really good however quantity was lacking. The crunchy tacos themselves seemed overdone causing it to be a bit too crunchy almost bordering on burnt. Their green sauce had a good amount of kick to it as well which saved the taco. Lastly their price was a bit high at 2.25 each. Would try this place again but go on Taco Tuesday as it becomes a $1 each.   If you're looking for pretty decent crunchy tacos then try out this place. If you're looking for a replacement to Rienda's, keep searching."}
{"text":"Small place with big taste! Fast and friendly service.  Everything we tried was delicious. The green chili with homemade flour tortilla was amazing.  Chicken Quesadilla Supreme was humongous and could feed 2. $1 Tacos on Tuesdays. Skip the chain and support a family owned and operated restaurant. Too bad I live in Michigan. I will be dreaming about the tortilla chips and guacamole until I come back to Arizona. This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru- Price was right $2.90 for a Carne Asada Taco. Beans, cheese, lettuce & meat. Was asked if I wanted BOTH green and red salsa. Yes please! Green had a nice heat, red one was okay. Asked for hot carrots, didn't get them-think they forgot? Service through the drive thru seemed slow for the time of day I was there: (1:15 PM).  Employee servicing the Window was very pleasant. Open 7 days a week 6 AM. Fairly big menu, I posted a picture of all they have to offer. Weekly special; Taco Tuesdays! I'll have to try other things on the menu if & when I go back.  Tostada was just average tasting. I got home & added my own guacamole & sour cream for added flavor. Taco shell was a little over fried.But the price was good."}
{"text":"Gone here every weekend since they've opened.  Hands down best breakfast burritos in the area.  Don't let the looks deceive you.  This place is worth a check-in.  Staff is also extrmenly friendly."}
{"text":"OH MY THEIR CARNE ASADA IS AMAZING! I notice it's usually pretty empty, but once I gave them a try I realized that they are my new favorite authentic mexican food! Five stars hands down"}
{"text":"OMG we just moved here to Gilbert and we've been looking for a Mexican place for a quick meal ... We found it!   I love this place! First time here and we'll definately be back. The beans are awesome.  Now for some bad  info... the place doesnt look the neat and the dining room os small and not cleaned up after a customer leaves. Definately get food to go and eat in your car, in a park or take it home. Really nice people run the place they just need  make sure customers have a clean place to sit if they choose to eat in the restaurantm"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! They have great authentic Mexican food and the service is always awesome."}
{"text":"Better than Filibertos but still bland Sonoran style Mexican food. To be fair, I'll note that I prefer New Mexican style. I ordered a combo that came with refried beans, rice (good), 1 chicken taco and 1 shredded beef taco. Very bland.  Also ordered a cheese quesadilla with green and red salsa. The red salsa tasted flat and was missing something.....it just tasted like red chilis and water.  The green salsa is what saved the day.  Super yummy. I'd go back for the green salsa. Next time I'll try a burrito. I've heard that they have good breakfast burritos too. I only gave two stars because the salsa was the highlight of my meal."}
{"text":"I've had a lot of breakfast burritos through the years, and I tend to like the small hole in the wall establishments, this is in no way a 4 star product or even a 2 star for that matter."}
