{"text":"AWESOME!!! 
Enough said!
However!  I must say that the Sicilian pie is the best thing around! Actually it is second only to their jojo's! Nobody in all of the restaurants in all of the states I've been to even comes close to Mark & Phillies!!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Mark and Philly's. The food quality is great. The Sicilian pie is wonderful. Love the hot rice. It goes great with the chicken and jo jos."}
{"text":"Don't usually go here because of the high prices but decided to try it since we had a coupon.  Won't be returning.  Pizza crust was burnt and tons of grease.  BBQ wings were terribly dried out.  They should put away all those awards displayed.  They certainly don't deserve them anymore.  Poor quality for the price!  Extremely disappointed!"}
{"text":"Family business run by a sweet couple. Delicious pizza and great antipasto salads. Always on time with delivery or pick up. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"I tried this local establishment for the first time tonight and had the Sicilian pie deluxe. An earlier review mentioned the pizza being greasy and I am afraid that I have to agree. This was not simply from the meat ingredients, but probably something with the dough or how much oil is used in the pan. The crust was just too heavy instead of crispy. Maybe the suggestion to order a half baked pie is the answer. I really wanted to like this place as I like Sicilian pie pizza style and I will probably give it another chance, but it was not an out of the park obvious \"wow\" experience."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of pizzas and the amount of grease on them was too much for my taste.   But if you don't mind a lot of grease, it doesn't taste to bad."}
{"text":"Marc & Phillys is just down the street from me. I love their pizza. I love the crust.  I've never tried anything else on their menu except their jojos which were very tasty. The people are friendly. The pizza is consistent. I perfre mom n pop places rather than chains. I say give it a try. I only gave it 4 stars bc I haven't had other their food options besides pizza."}
{"text":"So so good! The best chicken and jo jo's around. Pizza is greasy but good. If you don't like greasy pizza then don't try it. The chicken and jo jo's are amazing!"}
{"text":"Known for their Sicilian Pie. A delicious cheesy filled pizza pie. They also have great regular pizza, salad, chicken and joe joes along with other things. We've used both pick up and delivery. Reasonable priced."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic sicilian pizza, this is the place to go! I absolutely fell in love with your ingredients like sauce, cheese and especially the crust! This place is something phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This place use to serve the best pizza in the Falls area. We ordered from there recently the food was pretty good but the service wasn't great. I felt like the girl working was in a rush to get home and didn't want anymore customers to order. It was an hour before they closed up but still customer service goes a long way."}
{"text":"We live 2 blocks away and get take out regularly... there is no eat in.

They were closed between Christmas and New Years with no note on the door so we thought they may have gone out of business.

Hubby always orders the fish and french fries... we aren't jo-jo people but they have those too.  The fish is not greasy and the pieces are large.

We get our pizza partially cooked and then finish it at home... they have a thick Sicilian option that didn't seem cooked enough until we finished it our selves in our oven.

Salads are nothing to write home about.. bread sticks are good, but the cheese whiz 'cups' that come with them are tiny.

Toasted Italian sub come with a good amount of meat by default but I order double cheese.  They come with a small cup of Italian dressing so you can add as much or as little as you want.

Coupons come in a local flyer that comes in the mail once a month."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know what the hype is about.  I was looking for a good local pizza place, and found a lot of great reviews for Mark and Philly's.  I found their food just plain awful.  The mushrooms were obviously from a can, the pizza had zero flavor, and it was like eating a slab of grease.  Maybe their regular pizzas are decent, but the sicilian is just plain bad."}
{"text":"Everyone around here knows that Mark & Phillys has great pizza, but have your tried their lasagna?? Seriously,  get the lasagna. I order mine with meatballs...three big homemade meatballs, a huge piece of cheesy, tomato-y lasagna (scratch-made by Mark ) and two warm garlic breadsticks for $7.25"}
{"text":"Mark and Philly's makes lots of good sandwiches and pizza, but the very best thing is the Sicilian Pie, a pizza with a heavy layer of cheese on top.  I'm back visiting Akron and had my first pie in a couple years tonight and it as good as when I lived here,  There is nothing like it anywhere."}
{"text":"NOM one of the best pizza places around, esp in the Falls area. Comparable to mama santas in cleveland's little Italy. Also, they still delivered even though our location was a bit outside of their delivery zone. Great pizza!"}
{"text":"Not sure what makes their Sicilian-style pizza Sicilian, as it really is more reminiscent of a Chicago-style deep dish. But hey, it sure is tasty! They could use a more updated sign, but the food is good!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from them for 3 yrs and they've gone from great to never again. Tonight\"s pizza was burned and had no toppings whatsoever ever. Our super deluxe had no toppings! Too many other places to waste money on them."}
{"text":"They do take credit cards now, and yes there is dining in. Try the Sicilian pie, it's awesome."}
{"text":"Mark and phillies is our go to pizza shop in the Falls. The restaurant is family owned and the pizza best everything I've found in the area. Id recommend the Sicilian pizza with roasted garlic. My only recommendation for them is to add fresh Basil as a topping option.  Give them a shot

Ps a previous review indicated that there was no were to eat in. This is no longer the case as there is an entire row of  booths."}
{"text":"Pizza was decent. Lady on the phone (owner, I'm guessing as she was the only one in the place when I picked up) was short and rude, and pretty much the same face to face. Also, they are pretty proud of their pizza, as their prices show."}
{"text":"I called this place on behalf of our little league and asked for the Manager.  Philly got on the phone, and before I could tell her  why I was calling, she interrupted me and asked me if I knew this was a place of business.  She proceeded to tell me they were busy and they did not have time for this phone call.  Unreal.  She did not even know why I was calling.  I could of been calling to order pizza for our baseball 
team.  
Regardless of how the food is, not sure I would recommend this place due to the rude customer service."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. No one in this world makes a sub like Mark and phillys - we stop every weekend. And the Jo Jos are out of their world. Many other great picks! You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The best deep dish pizza  and their salads are soo good with a lot of cheese.  The owners of this mom and pop are so kind  courteous and hard working  they have won numerous awards over the past 20 years"}
{"text":"I only pray this place exists in heaven!  Best sicilian pizza and top quality ingredients, especially the cheese.  Now back to my treadmill!"}
