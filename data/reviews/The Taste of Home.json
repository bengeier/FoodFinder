{"text":"I found it, the worst restaurant in Toronto. The food was noodle was tasteless and there were sand in every mouthful. I told the waitress and she said next time I will ask the kitchen people to wash the vegetable more,  The noodle were practically soaking in oil and the waitress said yes there is too much oil, I will ask the kitchen people to use less oil next time. so we couldn't eat it but were told that we have to pay for it anyway. 
After I talked to a friend about it, he said he was just about to go there but he met couple of friends in the mall and was told to avoid it."}
{"text":"My family enjoys eating spicy food and we've tried a lot of places in the neighborhood, this place is probably the best combination of quality and price. I've come here a few times and my family got the VIP card. Their portions are very generous compared to other restaurants of the same cuisine (unlike tian fu), tastes on par and much much cleaner than yangs bbq.

Would recommend their pickled vegetables with fish fillet in soup, spicy fried chicken, pork belly in peppers"}
{"text":"First off, there is a VIP distinction here where you basically pay 20 dollars for the VIP card (valid for 2 years I believe?) and you get a \"discount\" on the menu. Typically these discounts range from 2 to 4 dollars so if you are going in a large group and visit often, then it is a \"good deal\". Otherwise, not so much.

The rectangular tables (for 2 to 4 people) was rather small. That was my first and last impression of the restaurant. Ordered a little too much food (portions are quite big) and there was almost no room to fit the last dish on the table. The staffs are friendly and nice which is always good. Unfortunately, the tea and food get cold really REALLY quickly for some reason so it was not a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Love this place so much I got the VIP card (good for 2 years from the date of purchase).

My favourite dishes are:

- the pork belly in spicy garlic sauce: 5/5
- the rice in a bamboo tin (comes in different food combinations): 5/5
- the whole fish soup with radish in a pot (comes with vermicelli and is a meal in itself): 5/5

Very mainland Chinese in decor and service. Rest assured for those who don't speak the language, there's English translations and pictures to help with your selection.

Food is bold and flavourful. 
TASTE OF HOME is like my second home."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight.  We were a table of 5 and the tables are quite small.  We should have sat at a bigger table because our dishes didn't all fit on our table.  But that's partly because 1 - we ordered too much food and 2 - they use really large plates with big rims.  

We ordered a couple of cold starters, had much better at other places.  This place specializes in big fish heads, we ordered half a big fish head, steamed with a sour and spicy sauce.  Fish head was ok, came with a bowl of noodles on the side.  You mix the noodles into the sauce from the steamed fish head.  We ordered the steamed eggplant with pork and garlic.  It was a nice saucy dish, best eaten with a bowl of rice.  As mentioned before, by another yelper, totally not worth the price(think it was $10.99).  We got hot and sour soup, was not as good as the one 2 doors down.  Braised beef noodles came in a massive tureen.  The beef brisket was lovely, a bit fatty, not dry and flavourful.   Also ordered lamb in cumin, nice juicy lamb.  


Food is quite nice here, nothing we had was terrible.  Service is ok, they changed our bowls and dishes.  I would come back, if I wanted this type of cuisine again."}
{"text":"Went to this restautant in a large party of 8. To be able to try more dishes. This restaurant is focused more on northern style cuisine. It is definitely a restaurant that is even more focused  as the chinese name specifically mentions its fish head soup. 

We of course has to try the fish head soup which was one of its most famous features. And we ordered a batch of other dishes as well with had its combo meal with the fish head  

The food was some hits and some misses. The eggplant chilie dish was a great dish to try  as they do a good job at it. The noodles were also excellent. 

Thr smoked fish which is a cold dish and turned out sweet is not a good dish. And the sesame beef is definetely not good as they had used wings buffalo sauce for some odd reason. Sesame beef is usually sweet and not sour. And on top honey is used for most restauarants. And not western chicken wing buffalo sauce.  

The other dishes were generall not bad. And decent. 

Overall service is like many chinesr restaurants. And also the decor is very old school. 

The fish head soup which is there speciality  they did a good job at it. And is very nice and warming perfect for a cold day. 

This restaurant i would say you need to be selective of what you eat. As not everything is okay. Come here and focus on northern chinese style cuisines. I would avoid popular southern cuisines here as they are not special in making itm and their interpretations of it. Might make some dislike it

Worth a try i would say"}
{"text":"2.5 stars, but I'll round up because this is their first review.

Taste of Home is a Northern Chinese restaurant specializing in fish heads. It's an offshoot of Backyard Garden Restaurant, situated right next door. A nice perk is that you can order off both Backyard Garden's and Taste of Home's menus while seated at Taste of Home. 

Upon entering, our first issue was that they tried to seat us at a round table next to a pillar. The pillar was blocking a good portion of our table. Almost half of our table was also blocked (seat-wise) by diners at other tables (the seating here is very cramped and the tables are very clumped together). We asked to be moved. They acquiesced, and moved us to a rectangular table for four. It was a very narrow table. Underneath it was a very large metal table stand (akin to those used at Korean BBQ restaurants). It was slightly sticky, and left next to no leg room for diners. We actually opted to go back to the round table. They moved it out for us, slightly, so that we could get in and out with some kind of ease, but it took a while to rectify that situation.

We had:

Lao Ma Roasted Pork - so Lao Ma is the name of the restaurant (in Chinese). It also happens to be the phrase Chinese restaurants use to indicate that something is particularly tasty (similar to if one was to add, \"mom's\" to any menu item). Obviously, we (and the table behind us) thought that we were in for a special treat. This roasted pork is char siu. It was dry, super thinly sliced, cold, and sauceless. It looked NOTHING like the picture (I know that pictures are a cop-out, but McDonald's burgers look more like their pictures than this looked like its picture). We and the table behind us talked to the waitress about it, and she shrugged us off. 

Chinese Buger ($2.99) - Or burger. Think a Chinese-style flattened, steamed bun pan-fried and slit in half, then stuffed with chopped up pork and cilantro in an almost hoisin and oyster sauce. For $2.99, the portion was pretty good (bigger than I had hoped), and was quite tasty. This would make a good snack.

Eggplant with minced pork - The eggplant pieces were really long. We had to ask for a knife. It was presented quite well (more similar to the picture). The pork was not mixed into the eggplant. It was a part of the presentation. There was a load of minced garlic and some diced hot peppers in this dish as well (also part of the presentation). This dish tasted quite good, but for the price, I wouldn't order it again.

Crab special ($9.99) - They have a crab special going on right now and it comes in a variety of cooking styles. We opted for the one with crispy bits of garlic and fried crab. For $9.99, this was not bad.

Fish head with tofu in soup ($19.99 for small) - For that price, this was a large pot of soup. The soup could have had a lot more fish flavor, but it was good, in a very subtle way. There could have been a lot more fish in a pot that size, but the fish definitely wasn't invisible. There was a lot of tofu. Also some wood ear fungus, some bok choy, some bamboo shoot?, goji berries, star anise, white pepper, etc. I might come and get this again, but only because it's super hot."}
{"text":"The food was decent 3.5 stars for that. The service is -1 star. 

BEWARE: They have two different prices. 

One for \"members\" and the other for \"non-members\". It's twenty to join so you either join and have a party big enough to break even or pay more for the same food and leave feeling ripped off.  

The waiter that seated us seemed like a nice kid but um.....looking dumbfounded when I ask for seats is a little awkward. He couldn't tell us anything about the menu....didn't seem to understand Cantonese, mandarin or English?....then when he took our order, another waitress came over and pretty much told us \"how am I supposed to know spicy you want it when you don't tell us?\"  \"Ummmm.....the kid that doesn't know anything took our order and didn't ask\".

The while dining experience was awkward. Won't be coming here again. Granted, we are from out of town but I can't recommend this to locals."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Ordered 4 dishes & the total was only $23+tips.  They have a variety of lunch specials for $5.50 which includes a soup or soy milk or add a dollar for rice.  I ordered sweet & sour fish, steamed grilled meat buns, steamed dumplings & chinese meat pancake.  The value was extraordinarily cheap.  The food was good.  The portions were good.  The fish was extra crispy & the dumplings were awesome.  Overall the food was great & the value was excellent.  Come try it if you're looking for a good cheap eat in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I usually dine at Southern Chinese restaurants, as in Chiu Chow, Shanghainese, and Cantonese food, so this review is from the perspective of such diner.

We ordered 2 non spicy dishes and 1 spicy dish that was at one chili spiciness level.  We didn't ask the kitchen to alter the spiciness.  The one chili level tasted hot to me.  The spice was quite easy at first few bites, then it accumulated to hot.  At this heat level, I could not tell if it was salty or not.  It could be, because my BF was thirsty afterwards.  

The non spicy dish tasted decent,  The barrel rice was a rice with meat served in a wood barrel.  The presentation was cute.  The variety that we chose had very little pork slices.  You could regard it as a rice with bamboo.  The smoked fish didn't tasted smoky.  It appeared to me that the chef cut the smoking time short, then he added the sauce.  I wouldn't order it again.

Note that while there are a member price and a non-member price for dining in, I notice that the take out menu only has the member pricing.  I assume it may mean that, for taking out, you don't need a membership to get the lower price."}
{"text":"I thought I might take a risk with the average ratings it has and I'm glad I did. They made it so perfect with both dishes I had to tell the owner. I haven't had such good Szechuan food for a long time. 

Hands down, definitely try their fish fillet pickled vermicelli soup and their meat pancake.

I can't vouch for their other dishes because there's too many to choose but these 2 dishes I have fallen in love."}
