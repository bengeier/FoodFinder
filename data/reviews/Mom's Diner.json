{"text":"Filthy dirty, horrible service, even worse food!  Will not go back!
I am just thankful that I didn't get sick!"}
{"text":"We eat at a ton of diners since we drive back and forth across the country every couple years.  This place is the BEST.  It has not just classic diner food which is sometimes just what one wants but also has some healthy versions of favorites.  I love the chrome decor!  The location is hiway close.  The wait staff to spite other reviews was really nice and very attentive.  Filled my Diet Coke as I drained it - 4 times!!!"}
{"text":"Great little diner. Portions are a good size and the price is reasonable. Very 50s in this place. They have great soups as well. It's right up the street from my office so i think I'll be there a lot. Only drawback is the service.  If it's a little busy, the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Mom's diner used to be MUCH better. First of all now the service is terrible. I asked for a bottle of ketchup... Never got one. And the food isn't as good either. Just a couple years ago it was great. I don't know what happened but i am not coming back."}
{"text":"I did enjoy my food, just not the prices. Or the service. I ordered pancakes and the server asked me if I wanted whipped cream, so I said sure, thinking it was complimentary. Well, when I got the check, it was an extra 1.99. I checked the menu, and whipped cream was listed with a price, but with a side of fruit (which I didn't get, so they added 1.99 to the bill just for a small squirt of whipped cream!). This just seemed super shady.

I do give this place a tiny bit of credit for being cute, very chrome, diner-y, 50's-ish, inside and outside as well. My friend ordered an omelet and it looked like a magazine picture, with a perfect slice of avocado and fruit arranged around the place. And it was tasty, but much smaller than you'd expect (sorry, but where I come from, diner food is both tasty and cheap! not so here).

I don't think I'll come back here, but if you are looking for something to impress the inlaws (at least from the outside) and you're not very hungry, this might be OK."}
{"text":"After a  strawberry chocolate milkshake, biscuits and gravy dish, and corned beef with eggs breakfast later and my sister and I were happily full. Honestly there isn't too much to say other than this place (which is now called Village Diner) is great for a weekend breakfast if you don't want to wait around. I would advise against getting the biscuits and gravy though. I just really didn't prefer it, there was just one flavor that made it unappetizing. The corned beef with eggs was a millions times better. Milkshake was basic also. Hence the 3 stars overall rating.

I felt as though the service was great. Our server was attentive, helpful, and kind. As for the price, that was also very cheap. Bill came out to be around $8 for me, plus tip I had a filling meal for $10. So I am confused over what others experienced in their reviews..."}
{"text":"I regret eating here. Their chicken sandwich was bland and the onion rings were way too greasy. Also, the service sucked. I asked for a side of ranch and never got it. Our server wasn't too friendly either. I've had waaaaaay better."}
{"text":"Have had gyro omelet, corned beef hash, pancakes, milk shake, breakfast sandwiches... Basically anything breakfast. Everything is decent to good. The loaded home fries are particularly delicious with fresh veggies. It's convenient, fast to be seated (as opposed to yours truly and pancake house up the street), friendly, and inexpensive."}
