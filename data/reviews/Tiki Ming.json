{"text":"An above average Tiki Ming.  Their prepared to demand dishes, Singapore Noodles, Shanghai Noodles , etc. are fine for this genre.  Avoid the soggy steam table food."}
{"text":"Mauvaise cantine chinoise... J'y ai mangé du riz frit, un mélange de légumes et des rouleaux de printemps végétariens. Le seul truc relativement bon la-dedans c'était les rouleaux de printemps. Pour le reste, le riz est trop cuit et n'est vraiment pas bon. Ca m'a laissé un mauvais goût dans la bouche pendant une heure. Bref, à fuir."}
{"text":"I have eaten at one or two other locations of this chain and wasn't impressed. But that was not the case today. This Tiki Ming is clean. The staff is friendly. The food is hot and fresh and they don't skimp on portions.   I had a plate with Pan Fried Noodles, General Tao Chicken and Garlic Spareribs. The Noodles weren't the greatest. Almost tasteless on their own. But once you added the sauce from either of my other choices, they were quite good.   The chicken was crispy and flavorful and hot. The ribs were plentiful. About half didn't even have a bone and there was little fat. A pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"I swore two years ago that I would avoid restaurants with warming trays .The last time I ate at a Tiki Ming (two years ago)..I was disappointed. Today, I decided that I would give them another try and would simply have vegetable fried rice. I was sure no restaurant could screw up vegetable fried rice..it was a safe bet, right?.. Wrong! Tasteless.. and I will attach a photo showing the amount of vegetables in my vegetable fried rice.. what a laugh!"}
{"text":"I went to Tiki-Ming Restaurant, the Restaurant in the basement near peel metro. I had  noddles. I asked for \"No Cilantro\", but they gave me cilantro anyway. My dish smelled like cosmetics and the noddles were under cooked. I like Thai food, but I don't recommend Tiki-Ming."}
