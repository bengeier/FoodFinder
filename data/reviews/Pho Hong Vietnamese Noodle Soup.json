{"text":"A regular Vietnamese Pho with no bells or whistles. Average food quality."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Wonderful service. Great prices.  Soup has nice flavour.  I wasn't a fan of the meatballs.  The chicken was very good.  We will return."}
{"text":"Two weird things stood out to me when I entered the restaurant - the Grecian decor and the Korean menu board on the wall... Both things in a Viet restaurant just makes you go \"huh?\"   The pho here is definitely not the best I've had... while the soup tasted fine, it lacked depth in flavour. We also ordered a couple fresh rolls, which tasted alright but that's about it.   Mediocre food aside, service was good and friendly (albeit a bit difficult to flag them down). When we asked for more condensed milk for our iced viet coffee, they didn't hesitate to give us the entire can and let us add it ourselves."}
{"text":"Pho here is delicious, fast service, clean, quiet, basic and tacky decor but that doesn't bother me. Not ideal for fancy date or such, but good food. Owner was chatting with his friends constantly at the table next to mine, there was no music being played. Clean utensils."}
{"text":"I work near this restaurant and just discovered it. I will make it a habit and probably drag all my colleagues with me to lunch!  Menu is a good size, it's not overwhelming but lots of selection. I suggest #32, vermicelli with pork and spring roll. Lots of crispy veggies, an enormous bowl, spices on the pork were exactly what I'm worth it.  People working were great too. The waitress was always busy serving or cleaning, but very pleasant. Peter, the man who was working when I had lunch, was also very nice. He manned the checkout and was very friendly.   Try it out!! It's in the Time Square plaza (I think, I came in the back) so you have to search for parking, but it is worth it. I'm hungry now just thinking about it...."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people don't like this place  Sure the broth is different from other places, even for me after the first time I was like da heck did I taste since it was different, I went back to kim po but I felt that their broth was too salty after the visit to Hong pho. So now I'm used to the taste at Hong I can't take the places that have salty broth  And the service is one of the best out of all pho places I've visit. The owner is korean, he's a really nice guy, other men working there are Vietnamese they don't speak good English so that might be the reason why they don't seem as friendly. At kim po everything seems so fast paced, at Hong pho I feel like I can take my time this is the main reason why I'm a regular at Hong Pho now"}
{"text":"I usually go here with my co workers for lunch. It's pretty good and the owners are super nice. The decor is kinda off and doesn't fit well. There are a lot of different types of food so lots to choose from. Thai, Korean, vietnamese."}
{"text":"Staff are very nice! Food is okay. The fiancé was craving pho so we found this little spot before going to the movies. The atmosphere was a bit cold. The food serving was alot (for me). Overall, okay!"}
{"text":"Here for lunch and I have to admit, 1st time I've seen a Vietnamese restaurant run by a Korean (no racist intent). We were seated quickly but retrieval of order was slow, owner seemed to be the only waiter. Decor gives off the impression of a Mexican/Middle Eastern with Europe mix. Prices are higher than what I'm used to seeing (ex. Rice platters and vermicelli bowls are minimum $9.99!) Decided on XL Pho/ spring rolls to share between fiancé and I (pho was a tad better on price) Ton of noodles, broth is different and not greasy, so this is a positive point. I would suggest more basils and maybe an option of boiled sprouts for the Chinese community (I'm a fan of raw so it doesn't bother me) Spring rolls were mediocre and quite greasy. Overall, I say meal was good but nothing to brag about and I still prefer Pho in the West ;)"}
{"text":"Came here on an extremely cold day to warm up the stomach. This pho place did the job well. My girlfriend ordered the large beef pho and I got the chicken pad thai. The pho wasn't bad, it did it's job and warmed up our stomachs. The chicken pad thai could have been better, it was very spicy but the portion was generous, there was enough to pack for another meal. Service was good, there was one server working but it wasn't too busy so we got prompt service. The meal was approximately $25 after tax and tips for the pho and pad thai. This place isn't bad."}
{"text":"Note to self: if a place is almost empty during dinner time, trust your gut and stay away.  The pho places i've been in always had only a couple of tables free left when I got there, so when I saw this place almost empty I immediately wanted to turn back. Unfortunately, I was overruled by the group which meant I got to try another one of those places that I visit once vowing never to return.  The pho at best was average.  Didn't come with basil which is what I get everywhere else. I should not have to ask for it. Felt like the beef broth was diluted with a lot of water and thus losing a lot of flavour. The spring roll was god awful. One of the worst I've had in the GTA (this includes Vietnamese fast food kiosks you can find in malls). It was dry, not properly wrapped, not enough filling, basically the only thing proper about it was that it was deep fried and not raw.   On the plus side, the small bowl was pretty large but this is usually the case in any pho spot.  Prices are average too,  almost $7 for a small bowl. Come to think of it, that seems a bit pricier."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, seems like a quiet spot. Not very fancy, The pho was good. Good and quick service, got our food super quick, but possibly because there wasn't a lot of people here at the same time. A bit chilly in the restaurant tho. Free wifi In Here as well, definitely a plus.   The staff are super nice. One of the waiters even took a few minutes to reach my friend how to use chop sticks."}
{"text":"Very good soup I had soup number 2 flank steak pho soup. I put in the mint a bit of Sriracha  and squeeze the lime and put in the sprouts. The establishment is very clean and the staff is polite it was the first time but not the last time I will come here. They also take credit card where some places around here do not that was the main reason I came here in the first place because then I can business expense it.  This is probably the best pho soup that had anywhere. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I ordered extra large and my wife had normal size. The difference besides price? The size of the bow."}
{"text":"Really bad coconut milk shake....."}
{"text":"Came into this restaurant with low expectations but it was worse than what I thought it would be. The fact that there's a korean section on the menu should've been a sign for us to leave but we thought we'd give this plave a try (didn't read Yelp reviews beforehand).   The pho is not great. Got like 5 pieces of meat with my bowl of pho.. My boyfriend ordered a large and I ordered a small. The difference in bowl size is pretty much nothing.  We also ordered the pork spring rolls, which definitely DID NOT have any pork in it. Spoke to the server (I think he mightve been the owner) that there was no pork and he said they use ground pork so \"you can't see it, but it's in there\". All I saw and tasted were vegetables.   Don't waste your time/money and go somewhere else for Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Good value. Food is fresh and good quality.  Fast and friendly service. Don't come for the ambiance or decor."}
{"text":"Usually, before I try out a new place, I'd consult Yelp first. The one with the most favour able reviews, I try. But with my tummy ruling over my brain, I did it the other way around. I was in this plaza on Times and saw this Vietnamese restaurant, and decided to try it out. I ordered the beef stew noodles with carrot chunks and as I waited for my order to arrive, i read the yelp reviews. Too late for me to leave :) In all fairness, the service was prompt, (I was the only one there). The noodle soup was just ok, the beef chunks are fewer compared to other places I've tried, and the broth was a bit watered down and found it bland, it lacked flavour and spice. I finished what I ordered, that's how hungry I was. I would only consider coming back here if there's no other choice. So I guess that would be - never."}
{"text":"I'm from Vancouver, BC and just came to this city not too long ago. Pho is pretty big in Vancouver and I would say pho hong is comparable to the top pho places in Vancouver. Great authentic soup base, served HOT. Generous in bean sprouts and other sides. Really reasonably priced as well! Last but not least, the service was exceptional and it was a comfortable dining environment! :)"}
{"text":"Inside looks like it use to be an Italian or Greek restaurant. Good amount of seats and a clean look overall.   Got the vermicelli with with grilled pork and a single spring roll for $9.99 and a iced coffee with condensed milk for $3.90  There was a good amount of meat. The noodles were done right. Overall, the meal was very light and delicious. The ice coffee came in a little coffee filter device over the cup. Not sure why they don't just prepare the whole thing in the back. So once the coffee finish filter through I had to pour it into the cup with the high possibility of spillage. The ice coffee did taste really good and was really refreshing on a hot summer day.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Wanted to have Vietnamese food around the area and realized I never visited this place before. Unfortunately, I won't be coming back again. We ordered on the menu form yet they still somehow managed to give us the wrong size for our noodles. When we inquired about it, the lady was super confused and finally came back with a bigger bowl of soup. It seemed that they had simply put the small order of noodles into a bigger bowl with more broth. The pho wasn't bad but the whole confusion and lack of getting what I paid for (stingy portions) was a turn off for me."}
{"text":"To be honest I'm not a noodle person. My fiance loves all types of noodles - even at seafood buffet, he would rather stand in line for a bowl of pho, ramen, or stir fry noodle. So when it came to meeting up with ex co-worker for a quick lunch date, I let him have his pick of pho since I was saving my belly for ayce Brazilian steak later that night.   This place was run by 2 older gentlemen - a bit overwhelmed with just 1/4 of the restaurant filled but tried their best to serve us throughout. We were given a sheet to submit where we checked off our order. My fiance and his friend both went with a bowl of pho (#2 and #11). I went with their seafood soup. The food came out relatively fast - each bowl of pho came with a side of bean sprouts, mint, and lime. My fiance seemed to enjoy his pho. My seafood soup was a bit disappointing however. There were 4 tiny pieces of shrimp, 3 cut up in halves fish balls, and 3 pieces of imitation crab sticks - for 9 dollars, it come in the same size bowl as the pho but really there wasn't much to eat at all.   Aside from the fact that we had to wait a bit between getting their attention to place our order and also getting our check, the service was friendly. Food was just okay and wasn't particularly cheap. Will probably look elsewhere for our next pho fix in GTA."}
{"text":"Pho soup base was a bit different from what I'm used to, and it was just okay. Wasn't my fan fave for the soup. However, I would go back for their chicken and rice. It was overall pretty good, good portion but a little on the pricey side for pho (12.99 for chicken + fried egg on rice). Service was suuuuuper slow. Had to flag down waiter about 3 times before he came to grab menu. I think they should hire out more people because other people were just as inpatient as I was."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite spot in Ontario the pho is tasty and big and the vermicelli is the best haven't even been close to it's equal"}
{"text":"Not amazing but not bad! It doesn't quite taste like authentic pho to be honest but you could find way worse. It's just fine."}
