{"text":"L'endroit est bien situé on ne pourrait croire au premier contact que c'est un restaurant . Ambiance cool et agréable, les tables sont en faces des cuisines d'ou nous voyons la préparation des dumplings. Un choix très variée de dumpling"}
{"text":"Wow, very delicious dumplings :-) Family restaurant, and the ladies there really know how to make dumplings in northern China style. ?? ????"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and the dumplings were super tasty - I've only gotten takeout so far, but the service was quick and friendly.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Dumplings were generously packed and oozed a fresh flavour.  Ordered takeout and watched one of the women prepare it before my eyes. Atmosphere was pleasant and staff were very hospitable."}
{"text":"As others have said, this place is a true GEM!!!!!!!  Found it on yelp looking for Chinese in the area I was staying, this place is an experience. It is basically in someone's house, very very bare bones set up, which means it is really damn good. Use google maps or keep an eye out for the dumpling sign out front, you will miss it, it's literally the first level of a town home made into a resto.  It's like eating at a family's house, you see one of the ladies making the dumplings right there, and they are tasty/fresh. I'm a vegetarian and they had a few veggie options which was great.  Can't think of another place I've eaten at in North America like this, still can't get over the bare bones family vibe this place had it was magic. Awesome servers and good prices.  A++++++"}
{"text":"Good dumpling and more really like it!!! People that were working there were all very friendly!!! So nice service !! I'm sure I will come back at this place !!"}
{"text":"The dumplings are so great!!! Even more, it's almost as same price as Thai Express, but the food is way much better!"}
{"text":"The dumplings at this quaint place are fabulous. Absolutely the best I've ever had!!! Can hardly wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Place is great!   Small and in an unassuming location, but dumplings are perfect and owner is very sweet and personable.   They do Togo frozen or fresh dumplings and have more flavor varieties than most other dumpling spots.   So good!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. best dumplings I have ever had and such a cute place. Came here a couple months ago with my man, he flew from the states, I from across Canada for a trip to Montreal. we ended up stumbling across this place and were both immediately obsessed. We just booked a weekend trip to come back purely for these dumplings. i'm not kidding! See you guys soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has about 4 tables and seems like it's in someone's home. Only 8 or so options of dumplings and the portions are huge! You get 15 dumplings per order. Very good! I recommend the porc zucchini shrimp and chicken coriandre(although warning-I know some people don't like cilantro and for some reason it seemed full of cilantro instead of coriander). Nice place to go with someone and order different kinds to share."}
{"text":"Incroyable restaurant dans un appartement particulier. Les dumpings sont fait en direct par la cuisinière. La pate est préparée et la cuisson s en suit.  Surprenant et pittoresque. J y retournerai."}
{"text":"To me, some or the most charming places you can go to are the places run by families. These are the places that are worth going out of your way for, not only for their food, but for the chance to meet and see a familiar face.  You're always happy to support their business, and they're genuinely happy to serve you. The more often you visit, the better and more special these outtings become.   The Dumpling Hut is an exemplary place for its simple cuisine, its humble setting, and its strive for authenticity. Most of all, it is run by one of the most discrete yet endearing women I have personally met.  The restaurant is only 4 months young and I wish I could bring her all the business she deserves. Yet, I selfishly hope it remains this small, manageable neighborhood restaurant so we can forever be graced by the owner's presence because everyone deserves to get to know her, her story and her food.  It was a shame I came here alone as I would've preferred to share this experience with others (though I'm sure it won't take long before I dine at one of her tables again).  To a long and prosperous business."}
{"text":"Delicious and flavourful dumplings. Portion was smaller than I would have liked, but it was still filling. The woman serving us seemed to be new, and despite some learning she had to do, was still courteous and prompt. I had a quick discussion with the owner who seemed very down to earth and happy to be serving food to new people! Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Incredible tasty, handmade, authentic dumplings. The ingredients are fresh. Small family team. Portions are fairly large and fairly priced.    I get take out all the time from here. Their menu has expanded to feature over 6 different types of dumplings."}
{"text":"Super contente d'avoir découvert ce resto à dumplings dans le Plateau, grâce à Yelp ! J'aime comment ce restaurant est fait, c'est genre dans le salon d'un appartement typique du Plateau (c'est très petit donc il peut y avoir environ 20 personnes assises). Ils ont une belle sélection de dumplings et vous pouvez même en commander 1 sorte et les avoir moitié frits et moitié bouillis (sans charge supp). La portion est généreuse (15 dumplings bien remplis) et ils sont très bons. Les prix varient entre 10$-14$ pour une assiette de 15 dumplings et ils prennent les cartes de crédit."}
{"text":"Heavenly. If you like stumbling upon restaurants that are seemingly holes in the wall with the most memorable food, this is it. The restaurant may be small but it is filled with great people and amazing food. The dumplings are authentic and full of flavor, my favorite since being in China. There are many great options, start with seaweed salad then pick your fancy. Highly recommend for not only the food, which is the staple, but the friendly people and charm of the place.   Enjoy."}
{"text":"Great dumplings. Convenient location for McGill students. I had the beef and coriander dumplings."}
{"text":"If you like dumplings -this is the place! Over a dozen varieties and 15 to a serving. As we were leaving I heard someone ask for half of one variety and half of another -that's what I'll do next time. Staff is friendly - and interior is simple, calming, and unassuming - as is the exterior."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick delicious bite nearby my hotel, and found this gem. You can easily miss the entrance if you don't see the small clapboard sign out front. The inside is like the living room to a home made up as a dining hall, and creates an intimate vibe.   The menu is small, so if you're expecting much more than dumplings, you should go elsewhere, but the dumplings are made quick to order and the price is very reasonable. Completely hit the spot of what I was looking for."}
{"text":"What a lovely place to have a dumpling experience. This small house was so unobtrusive that I walked right past it, didn't see the sign or anything. I believe it was a Mother/Daughter owners when I walked in. I ordered 2 plates, one with Lamb and one with Beef. They were great texture but no taste, it fell somewhat flat. And not having any other options on the menu was disappointing. I would come here just to look out the window and see people walking by as it is a house, good luck and thanks!"}
{"text":"WOW, good dumpling in a quiet small place! I will definitely go back there! Good services also! The only issue we occur, it's to found parking spot, but the place it's a 5 stars !!!"}
{"text":"Incredible dumplings in a cozy and inviting setting. We had the pork dill, pork chive, and chicken coriander dumplings--all were excellent and the herbs were very fresh and very flavorful. The owner stressed that these were her home recipes and clearly took pride in her menu. We are only in Montreal for a week but will likely be back here before we leave."}
{"text":"The dumplings are excellent and a very good price. The service is great and the decor is very welcoming, though it's a bit weird how much it feels like you're just sitting in a stranger's kitchen. If you're into that sort of thing, then you'll be very comfortable, but if not, well... I saw one person walk in and then walk right back out again while I was there, and I suspect that's why. Still, the food was very, VERY good. I just wish they'd had steamed buns while I was there; I only got to try out the dumplings. Maybe next time, and there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"I live close to this restaurant and go there as much as possible. A hidden gem. Their hot pepper paste is spectacular, put it on everything you eat."}
{"text":"So yummy. Small husband wife team. In what looks like someone's living room. Small menu. Amazing dumplings."}
{"text":"We almost missed this. There is minimal signage outside-just \"dumplings\" on a window. Two or three salads on the menu and the rest are different varieties of dumplings. We had the cabbage and mushroom as well as the beef and onion. They were delicious and the portions were very generous. Definitely a great hidden spot!"}
{"text":"Super restaurant de dumpling. Ils sont faits à la demande alors on ne peut pas avoir plus frais. La propriétaire est extrêmement gentille. A recommander"}
{"text":"Dumplings were nice but part of The enjoyment of dining is the service which was really lacking. I think this place has huge potential if it was properly managed.   Menu is limited. Dumplings only. Steamed or fried. Seaweed and cucumber salad will required a specific pallet to enjoy.   If you really Jonesing for dumplings and don't really care about the ambiance, then come here for a quick bite. They also have take out and frozen which are interesting options. 15 dumplings ranging from $8.99-$12.99 depends on type of meat and vegetables."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekend with my wife based on all the great reviews. I must say we were a bit disappointed. We ordered the pork and chives dumplings and the chicken and coriander dumplings. Unfortunately, we could only taste soya sauce in both dumplings. The soya sauce was just too overwhelming and it totally masked the natural meat and good chives favours. The chicken and coriander ones were slightly better. In the pics shown in other reviews here, there was a lot more chives than meat in the dumplings. However, the ones we had had far more meat than chives. We went to another older Montreal favourite dumplings place the next day further down on St Laurent near the China town gate. Far much better and cheaper too! Won't be back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome hidden place! We loved it. Vegetarian dumplings were divine! Seaweed salad is a must."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about this place.  Full disclosures - Only tried once and only had a vegetarian option and a shrimp option.  Taste were fair (a little bland) to good (not the traditional and fast food store-bought thick dumplings). Their ingredients were not scarce - they pack em nicely, just like the pics.  I would try one more time but my concern was the level of blandness."}
{"text":"We ordered the veggie dumplings. Great portion. Enough for two. The vegetable stir fried dish was well prepared and tasty."}
{"text":"It was a very nice experience to eat a plate of 15 steamed dumplings, which is what you do here. The place is not a hut but a very fun ground floor apartment occupied by some very amiable Chinese dumpling masters or should I say mistresses because we didn't see any men. The Hut lacks any special decor but it is unique in that you  are practically eating In your Chinese auntie's kitchen. Oh yes about the dumplings, they were very good but they didn't knock my socks off. We had the lamb and coriander and the egg shrimp and chive dumplings. A plate runs between $10 and $13 and the selection includes pork shrimp chicken egg and veggie but there was no combination plates so you had order a big plate of 15. Get it? So if you're craving dumplings and are looking for cheap eats in an immaculately clean apartment this is a great option. With dumplings as good or better than some of the abattoirs in nearby Chinatown, this hut is a good bet."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! I recommend the beef and coriander. Definitely check it out"}
{"text":"This place is the cutest little mom n' pop operation just off rowdy St. Laurent. Sitting down in the restaurant feels like being invited to someone's house for dinner and you're just sitting in the living room waiting for dinner to be served. I've tried nearly all their dumplings and there isn't a dud in the bunch - my personal favourite is the pork and dill. It's worth noting that they only serve dumplings and nothing else, so don't go in expecting a laundry list of other Chinese delicacies. If you're into spice, make sure to put their homemade chili oil on everything! While I find the price perhaps a bit steep, it's totally worth it for these authentic, unpretentious, and delicious dumplings. A secret neighbourhood gem!"}
{"text":"Best dumpling ever.. super fresh and tasty. Pork and coriander and cabbage and mushroom is a must."}
{"text":"friggin amazing. as good or even better than dumplings from china. you won't regret it."}
{"text":"The dumplings were good and flavourful, and the dipping sauce was on the table so you can pour it yourself, which is nice. Pricing is pretty good, too - I got 15 dumplings for about $10.   I didn't really like the seaweed salad, it was by the kind of kaiso-type salad I was expecting and the dressing wasn't all that good.   Also I kinda wish they had the option for fried dumplings!"}
{"text":"Doesn't get anymore lowkey than this. This humble little simple place is a must try. Went on a weekday around 5ish as I wanted to satisfy my curiosity and I was not disappointed. The place only holds about 5 tables but those freshly made dumplings are worth the trip. Lucky for me I didn't have to wait for a table as I tend to eat early. Hunger made me forget to snap a photo of the food before attacking it."}
{"text":"Holy cow. Get over to this dumpling place right now! It is the cutest little room, its actually in a house. I went with my friend Yap Man and it was just an experience. The sun was shining into our backs, no not onto, but into because our hearts were melting into the atmosphere of heaven. The dumplings are the best I've had in Montreal, and I've had a lot of dumplings in Montreal (Har Bin, Sami Soupe, that place on st Laurent, King Ha, and I think another I can't remember) We were the only ones there and were confused because there should be a lot of traffic here.  If you don't come here you're actually stupid because it's so good you won't be able to deny it. Life is easier here"}
{"text":"If you are looking for home-made dumplings to eat at an unpretentious place, then you must visit this almost hidden place on the Clark street. This dumpling hut is a family run kitchen offering delicious, fresh dumplings at reasonable prices. They have their menu on the wall on the blackboard, not too many items but each of them perfect. My personal favorite is the chicken coriander dumpling. I also tried the black sesame icecream for desert, which was amazing. And to finish off I must mention that the service is attentive and polite."}
{"text":"Handmade dumplings is always a treat, but this location kinda fails to deliver anything special. The flavour was lacking, and the price for a dish is more expensive than the other well known dumpling places (in China Town and near Guy Concordia). The dumplings also didn't have much soup inside, which was a bit of a let down compared to the rivaling dumpling places.   Their cheapest option is $9 before tax+tip for 15 dumplings, which is more than the other places, for less flavoursome dumplings.  The service wasn't great, our water wasn't refilled a single time despite being the only customers in the restaurant at the time (it was early).   If you're looking for dumplings and this is the only place close to you, you'll probably enjoy it! However, if you have the option to choose between multiple places and distance isn't a big deal, I'd recommend the dumpling place in China Town over this one."}
{"text":"Gem of a place in the corner of Clark & Prince Arthur.  The owner is a very friendly & welcoming lady. Great dumplings and salad at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Tasty dumplings on the edge of the Plateau.  I must confess, I come here every few weeks just because it's *really* close to my apartment, and I'm never disappointed. The dumplings are delicious and the little family which runs it is very sweet. The only (slight) downside is the price, which is notably higher than would be charged for similar portions elsewhere in the city. Nevertheless, that's a small thing.   If you're anywhere near, give it a go."}
{"text":"Je préfère les \"soup-dumpling\" (au jus) et j'ai trouvé mon repas ordinaire, disons digne de 3 étoiles. Cependant, je trouvais injuste de retirer une étoile à cause de mes goûts personnels. Si vous aimez des saveurs plus prononcées et/ou la pâte cuite à la vapeur et/ou quand ça explose dans votre bouche, je vous redirige immédiatement chez Harbin (plateau) ou chez Qing Hua (Guy-Concordia). Autrement, poursuivez votre lecture!  Il n'y a pas de soucis à proprement dit avec ce resto, mais rien de trop spécial non plus. Je dirais qu'une de ses forces justement, c'est d'être ordinaire. L'endroit est tout petit, c'est décontracté, la madame cuisine juste à côté comme si elle vous recevait dans son appartement. En plus, ça donne un répit de toute l'action du boulevard St-Laurent.   La salade de concombre est fraîche et simple. Celle de la Maison de Madame Dumpling a plus d'assaisonnement et de préparation. Cependant, elle n'était pas chère du tout et c'était un bon complément de repas, je n'ai pas regretté de l'avoir commandée.  Les garnitures sont variées et indiquées à l'ardoise. Les sauces sont disponibles aux tables. Comme j'disais, c'est relax et ça contribue au sentiment d'hospitalité. J'sais pas pour vous, mais parfois j'en ai assez de manger dans des super-ambiances-électriques-musicales-sur-stimulantes. Manger, paisiblement, ça donne un vrai bon moment sain. Et puis, quand on a envie de partager du temps avec une personne qui nous intéresse, on a pas nécessairement besoin de tous les artifices ;)"}
{"text":"I was skeptical at first but this turned out to be a gem. Dumplings wee just right  and I could have eaten a hundred and wished I could eat different ones. Like dining in someone's home, very quaint.  The condiments complemented the dumplings well. ."}
{"text":"Best dumings I've had in Montreal! We ordered the pork chive, lamb coriander, chicken coriander and egg shrimp chive. The wrapper was delicious, there was alot of filling and not too much doughy wrapper and you really tasted the filling of each dumpling. Although the waitress described each dumpling dish, I was able to taste in the flavors and knew which was which without her explanation. I find I can never truly taste the flavors at other dumpling restaurants. The restaurant itself doesn't have many seats so I suggest doing takeout or placing an order and eating in the park. Excellent dumplings!!"}
