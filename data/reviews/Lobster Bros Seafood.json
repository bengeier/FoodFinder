{"text":"I ordered  the Lobster Roll and New England Clam Chowder.

The lobster roll was decent, as the other reviewer mentioned it has a lot of imitation crab meat and not enough lobster. the sauce is good but a bit overwhelming.

The clam chowder was what I was most excited for and I'm definitely disappointed. For a seafood shop I expected better, it was reheated (I should have known better from the other reviews). The clams were not fresh (maybe because it was microwaved), and the soup was way too watery.

I wanted this place to be good but unfortunately it doesn't measure up."}
{"text":"Heard a couple of good things about Lobster Brothers.. They send coupons through the mail all the time. Always wanted to try them out, finally decided to give it ago. Ordered the crab cake sandwich.. Not bad but not good.. If I paid full price (7) dollars, I would have felt ripped off.. Also ordered the seafood platter. Comes with scallops clam strips shrimp French fries and a roll  (12) dollars. Save your money.. It's just frozen seafood placed in a fryer.. Your local grocery store has better frozen seafood. Won't be going back.. Then again what can one expect from a seafood place in a little strip mall."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place and unfortunately I am sad that I did. I ordered the lobster bisque and crab cake sandwich, both were disappointing. The bisque must have been old and reheated because it was watery, clumpy and not palatable. I took one bite and threw the bisque out. The sandwich reminded me of a fried freezer style crab cake. The sauce had good flavor but for a seafood place the crab cake tasted like fried breading and no crab."}
{"text":"I went here and used coupons I had. I ordered a crab cake sandwich, fish sandwich, and lobster rolls. The crab cake had wasabi aioli and it was delicious!!!! The fish sandwiches were the best I've ever tasted. And the lobster rolls had alot of lobster in them. I would definitely visit again if I'm ever out that way."}
{"text":"Lobster Brothers is not just a restaurant. Its also a fresh fish and seafood market, with a deli feel. They have prepared salads you can purchase buy the pound, even some sushi grade products. One thing I was very impressed with was the fact they get fresh sea bass and lobsters in. 

I come in for lunch and have tried the crab cakes and coleslaw and they were reasonably priced, fresh and very appetizing. I have also tried the crawfish corn chowder, it was a little spicy (not spicy enough for me). In it, corn, potato and tons of crawfish. I recommend for you to try the soup it was a really good twist on a typical seafood chowder. Have also had the lightly breaded shrimp dinner. It's served with coleslaw, roll and french fries. I don't recommend it even though was a large portion, it was just OK, nothing special (and I don't believe the shrimp was deveined). I really like the fish and chips, that totally satisfied my fried fish craving. Same thing as the shrimp dinner, minus the shrimp.

Do not order the lobster salad, it was not good at all. It had what I think was imitation crab, and a lot of it. I didn't taste or see any lobster. On Thursday they have a lunch special two for $12, me and my coworker split. Both of us threw some of it away and agreed we would never order it again. They lost a star due to this sandwich.

Once I try the calamari I will come back and update my review. 

Next time I want to treat myself or impress a dinner party, I'm all over the fresh sea bass (giant eagle doesn't carry this item). Surfs up!"}
{"text":"It was okay.  I hated my sandwich, its now sitting in my fridge waiting to be thrown out.  The soup was okay, I ate that, but I was the only one who thought it was edible.  My friend hated her sandwich, she thought it was cheap and tasted like nothing but imitation crab meat.  My mom thought her sandwich was okay, but needed lettuce or something else besides the lobster salad and bun."}
{"text":"You wouldnt know driving by because it looks like they only sell fish and lobster, but they have some of the best seafood soups ive ever had..... Seriously. All the soups have real seafood.... Like chunks of it! The crawfish corn chowder is probably the best soup I've had.... Perfect broth,giant pieces of chunky crawfish (taste like mini lobsters), and a hint of spice. And the clam chowder..... My goodness... Soo good. Ask to make sure that its fresh i had an old batch one time that they reheated.... Wasnt as good. The rest of the lunch menu sandwiches are ok, nothing special."}
{"text":"I received the lobster salad as a hostess gift and WOW! The best I've ever had. I live only about 15 miles away and didn't know about this wonderful place. I'll definitely go there soon and often."}
{"text":"This isn't just a place to get sea food, it's also an outstanding restaurant. I just got the clam strip platter and made all coworkers jealous. Great brothers, great restaurant! 5/5!"}
{"text":"Lobster roll is a solid lunch, and the smelt sandwich is great if you sub slaw for tarter sauce.  Wish they would serve on new england rolls rather than kaiser.  Those little bits on top add nothing but a mess in my lap."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great... average 

The staff is really nice, and I will probably go back. However after reading the reviews, expected to be wowed."}
{"text":"Went here today to get some bulk lobster for a restaurant.  They were great and the price i got the lobster meat at was far below the larger distribution companies like cysco and haserot."}
{"text":"I'm not opposed to going back, but I not exactly hooked, and my diet is primarily composed of seafood, carbs, veggies and fruits. I guess that I may just be spoiled with high-standards. The quality was acceptable especially for what the area offers but not impressive. 

FYI: this is a market not a dine-in restaurant."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a seafood place close to the house. I had friends in from CA and our one guest had never taken part in a clam bake. I ordered 6 dozen clams for the four of us and only had 6 not open. A pretty darn good ratio if you ask me. Fresh, fresh, fresh! Their lobster tails are fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Had a 50+ Person Clambake this weekend and these guys were great.  Rented the equipment from them, and the clams and food were amazing!   The guys were so informative and helpful in loading the equipment and explaining everything.  The party was hit!  This is my second time hosting a clambake from them and I have no complaints!  I highly recommend them and looking forward to trying out some of the other food they provide."}
{"text":"I've been to Lobster Bros many times over the years, and have been pleased with the selection and quality of fresh seafood, for the most part.  There has been a lot of negative news lately about how many American seafood distributors and/or restaurants are serving lower quality, different fish than what is indicated on the menu, which is disturbing, and has turned off a lot of seafood lovers.  I don't believe that Lobster Bros engages in this kind of dishonesty.  I've been very happy with what I purchase there, and sure that I am indeed getting what they tell me I am.  On a sidenote, if you like chilled 'cocktail shrimp', you must try a Cleveland product called \"Al's Gourmet Shrimp Sauce\" (Seven Seas Seafood Co.).  It is truly one of the best shrimp sauces i've ever had, and can be found at some supermarkets in our area."}
{"text":"Love Lobster Brothers! 
A great place to stop for seafood to prepare at home and also to grab some ready- made dips. 
The lobster salad and crab salad are so delicious. They are both made with mayo but, as I am not a mayo lover, they are not overpowering by the mayo and have a perfectly measured sweetness to them. 
I also love the Cajun crab dip- made with a cream cheese base and a light kick, this is a yummy dip for entertaining or for just enjoying yourself. 
So delicious to have huge chunks of crab and lobster in all three of these salads. 
We also ordered stone crab as an extra treat over the holidays and it was amazing. Super fresh and with the classic mustard/Mayo sauce. So exciting to get a nice batch of stone crab in Ohio during the season. 

I have tried the sandwiches and wasn't super impressed with the crab cake sandwich. It was different than I expected and maybe that's why I wasn't able to really enjoy it. It was a more combined filling and then breaded and deep fried. I know people who love it so try it for yourself. Lobster rolls are awesome! 
Don't miss this spot!"}
{"text":"Came here and first thing I noticed there were no tables. To-go only. Me and my friend split a lobster salad sandwich and also had the fried oysters. First off there was a reason the lobster sandwich was only $8. It's like imitation crab meat and langoustine lobster salad or as my parents like to call it \"The Poorman's Lobster Roll\". All joking aside, I thought the lobster salad was excellent. A bit strong on the mayo, but it still felt like I was eating a creamy lobster roll. 

The fried oysters were quite good as well. My friend wasn't a fan of the strong oyster taste, so more for me. Would definitely come back for the lobster salad. If I was feeling a bit fancy, I'd call in advance and order a steamed lobster or crab legs."}
