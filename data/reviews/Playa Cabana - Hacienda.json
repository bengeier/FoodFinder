{"text":"Food was delicious- Guac, the corn and the tacos... delicious! The service was nothing over the moon. Someone takes your order, 20 other people drop it off and the server no where to be seen. We wanted to get desert and another drink, but the waiter said that they had another rsvp for our 2 seater table in 15mins, even though there were 6 available tables surrounding us upstairs."}
{"text":"Overall the food was very good.  I found the food here much spicier than the food at Playa Cabana, but I have a relatively low tolerance for heat.  That being said though, the fried fish tacos are a must...delicious and flavourful, and the shrimp ceviche was amazing!  And while portions may look small they are very filling.

The place is fairly small, so while you don't feel overly crowded it isn't ideal for large groups.  Service is good - wait staff were friendly and always came around to fill our glasses with water.  

The reason why I'm giving them a 3/5 rating is because they couldn't accommodate our request to make one of the dishes non-spicy for my two young kids.  We were told by staff \"that the chef does not make any changes/substitutions unless it is due to a food allergy\".  I kindly asked our waiter if he could please make the exception and was disappointed when he brought out their food covered in jalapenos and a spicy sauce.  While my kids did try to eat it, it was just too much for their liking so we ended eating quickly and packing our food home.  While I understand their position, I think that this was a relatively minor request that could have been accommodated."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Whether it's just the two of us, or with a group of friends, we enjoy both the ambiance and the food."}
{"text":"I was pondering whether to give this place two stars or three, but ultimately settled on two for a number of reasons.

First the positive: Some of the tacos I tried, in particular the short-rib tacos and the tinga tacos were the second best in the city after Grand Electric.

But here's where the problems start right away.  Grand Electric charges $3.60 for a slightly superior taco, whereas the tacos at this joint are $6, which is frankly crazy for a small single taco.  You'll need 4-6 for a full meal.

And the negatives continue.  The tacos al pastor were not bad, but they weren't particularly authentic.  Also, I questioned whether all the tacos needed to have cream on them, it seemed like a non-creative way to enhance the flavour.

I'll turn next to the service.  We had to wait for about 10 minutes for a table, but when we were finally led upstairs I counted at least five empty tables.  Also, for some bizarre reason all of the Hispanic staff are relegated to either busing tables or serving as quasi-hostesses.  I just found this a little weird, but hey if the white applicants happened to be more qualified, maybe it was just a coincidence.  But here's the thing, our server was pretty crappy.  He didn't come to our table very often, mispronounced Spanish words (e.g. pronounced \"Pollo\" as Polo), and was unfamiliar with the menu (we had to point out where the Micheladas were located on the drinks menu).  He also forgot one of my taco orders.  So that made the delegation of the Hispanics to lower rungs a little more sinister in my eyes.  I should also add that we tried to order a drink from the person dropping off our tacos and we got the worse response possible in the situation: \"No you can't order drinks from me, but your waiter should be along shortly.\"  Here are the expected responses at a restaurant that is this expensive: 1) \"Absolutely\" (and then give the drink order to the server).  2) Second best \"I'll send your server right over.\"  In contrast, the response we got amounts to: \"Tough, you can order your drink when your server happens to come around.\"  Which kind of misses the point, i.e. if our server had been coming around regularly, we would have already ordered the drink from him.  

Next, in terms of the drinks, they were ridiculously overpriced.  Seriously, the pitchers were priced in the range of $42-$99 which is again, nuts.  And, when we ordered Micheladas, they served up some odd concoction that appeared to have tomato juice or some other weird red substance.  I was able to drink mine, but my girlfriend was not.  And here's my qualm, it's one thing to have an original take on a classic drink, but the menu needs to spell it out.  A traditional Michelada has lime juice, salt, beer and a salted rim, nothing more.  A Michelada preparada typically also has Maggi sauce and some other spices.  But I've never been served anything approximating the concoction at Playa Cabana Hacienda.

Let's turn to the ambiance.  I will say that they had nice imaginative decor, but the tables were a little bit too cramped together though that is a minor complaint.  Overall the set-up of the restaurant was pleasant, but the narrowness between the tables made them difficult to navigate which may help explain the slow service.

Which brings me to the next point. The clientele at the place was incredibly douchy.  It was pretty much exclusively white, and people in their late 30's and late 40's who ostentatiously spend cash.  Ordinarily I wouldn't blame a restaurant for their clientele, but when a restaurant plays loud music on the ground floor to give the place a clubby vibe (btw it is NOT designed for people to stand up with drinks on the bottom floor but they encourage it anyway), and charges those ridiculous prices, it's bound to attract the douchy sorts who like to flaunt their money.

Bottom line: good tacos, but not $6 good.  Go to Grand Electric instead."}
{"text":"Wow, yes! A friend and I wandered in around 6 o'clock tonight; got a table right away and proceeded to have a fantastic meal. 

Our server (also bartender) was knowledgeable, really explained the different hot sauces and food, sincerely cared about food allergies/intolerances (he brought it up) and was just a really nice unpretentious guy. 

We started with the usual guacamole and chips. But this is no average guacamole. Carefully spiced & happily lacking that typical filler of chunky red onion - it was perfect.

Both the La Truck and Polla Tingua tacos (we chose soft shell) were simply delicious. 

We ended with the superb Churros Poutine. Oh my...

I'll be back (probably this week)"}
{"text":"So much fun. The food is great (maybe slightly pricey) but I love the bar service, the excellent cocktails especially when you challenge the bartender to make something that he;s been working on. 

Love it."}
{"text":"OMG
This place is delicious! The taco were not just spicy but were layered with subtle flavours such as citrus, mild herbs and flavourful sauces. Yum yum yum
Highly recommend this place. I would recommend making a reservation."}
{"text":"Finally, some really great quality Mexican food!! So impressed with everything from their signature margaritas (especially grapefruit and Dave's) to the jerk lobster taco - just wow. Left feeling great, not at all greasy. I suggest going for the ceviche, grilled fish taco and jerk lobster taco on lettuce. Skip the fillers like chips, anything deep fried, beans and rice. All food was very fresh and full of flavour."}
{"text":"Visited Playa Cabana Hacienda last weekend and the restaurant definitely gave off that indie, yet not-too-hipster vibe. With dim lighting, friendly staff, and a liquor bar that was miles high, I was excited to dine. Stupidly, we did not make reservations, but were lucky enough to snag a spot at the bar. Our waiter was extremely friendly, introducing himself and then telling us the specials for the day. One of which the octopus tostada that I had to get and my boyfriend tried their chill infused tequila concoction. His drink arrived first and I must say, one of the most complex, yet amazing cocktails I've had in a while. It took about 10 seconds for the heat to kick in, but it was wonderful. To order we shared the...
- guac & chips to start (that's a necessity for mexican food, of course)
- octopus tostada
- kalbi beef taco (lettuce wrap style)
- chicken taco
- ahi tuna taco
- and lastly, the octopus taco that they are so famously known for

All were extremely flavourful, and just the right portion size to fill us up. The only 'decent' dish was the ahi tuna taco, which my boyfriend described as slightly under seasoned and an odd combination of flavours. However, the homemade green hot sauce at the table was to die for, and gave the tacos the perfect amount of heat.

I will definitely be returning to Play Cabana Hacienda, and after this experience, am excited to try some of the other Playa Cabana restaurants."}
{"text":"How this place could get a bad rating I am yet to find out.. Maybe they've been listening to you people. I have to admit I've only been once (early with resos for 4) BUT they have the best tequila selection / margaritas / Mexican food I've ever had personally, and I seek this stuff out. Plus I've been to Mexico! This is authentic Mexican food with a fresh/upscale flair and a great atmosphere. Had the Halibut ceviche, it was so fresh and brilliant with about a dozen ingredients it seemed and lots of finely diced fish. We tried the Jalapeno popper app special. So creative stuffed with oxtail meat and cream cheese breaded with Doritos crumbs.. are you kidding me?! Amazing. Not for the mild-med palate though. For mains my girlfriend and I shared tres tacos (chorizooooo0o0o) yummmmm so good, best part, wow, wanted 3 more. Tried my buddy's braised beef taco, also very good chorizo was better though; both were stuffed full. Second friend said the chicken burrito was the best he ever had. My only complaint: where the hell is that mango/habenero salsa* (*wild guess) from the little jars @ Playa Cabana tableside? Service was on point as well, no suggestions or banter though she may have been a little new? The drinks weren't necessarily cheap but they use quality ingredients and you can tell. I can't remember the name of it but get a friend or two together and get the premium pitcher of margarita with no simple syrup in it. It'll change your life. People have also reviewed and complained of getting the feeling of being kicked out.. I say this is a legitimate and fair \"No soup for you!\" situation.. It's that good"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner there - vibe is laid back and tables set together means you get to know the fellow diners a little bit.

Started with the grilled corn - pricey for what it really is; corn with toppings. Went to an assortment of tacos like the braised beef (yum!), pulled chicken (yum!), fried fish (good) and grilled octopus (good but had too much sauce). 

The food comes as its ready so the pace is good - seemed the next taco came in just as we were finishing one of them.

Tres leches cake for dessert was a must, and turned out to be a very good decision. Also a good decision to share dessert after the assortment of tacos.

Will certainly be back"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic meal for dinner. We had in mind tacos but was not sure what to order so we left it up to our server - Julian. We had a veggie and fish taco each and shared the lobster and LA Truck. Fantastic. Can't wait to bring others !!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Takes the waiters forever to take your order. Burrito looked fancy, but was rather bland."}
{"text":"The food and service are good here. Nice bartenders and servers, with nice drinks, a great back patio and ambience. We sat upstairs on a hot summer night, and it was a bit too stuffy. The space upstairs is also a bit tight, however it is worth trying if you can get a reservation."}
{"text":"We are frequent diners at this location as well as the one down the street, and I would say that Hacienda is a much better spot for groups. The food is fairly comparable, maybe slightly better at Playa Cabana. It is nice at the Hacienda location that you can mix and match your tacos, and since it's a little larger we have better luck walking in and grabbing a seat at the bar. We've had almost everything on the menu, tacos are by far our favorite but the enchiladas are a close second. Although it's not cheap, it's comparable to other restaurants in the area. The margaritas are some of the best I've had, very authentic and fresh!"}
{"text":"How should I start?  Warmth, wonderment and wow!  From the sassy service to the succulent cuisine- this place has it all.  I had to start with Dave's Margarita's ....ah, uhm, oooooo.....amazing...then came the grilled octopus tacos with the fresh cilantro and dash of pure decadence.  While sipping on the second Dave's Margarita, the main arrives filled with goodness that only true Baja cuisine can fill...mmmmmm, sweet divinity. 

The piece de resistance was the unique beverage d'art created by the great mixologist, Anshul, which ironically goes by the same name...the 'Anshul Masti'...filled with cool, sweet green wonder that revives memories of the sultry  beaches de Mexique...ask for The Anshul Masti by name- you won't be disappointed...

It was worth the 6km walk...

Thanks for a great evening folks, you filled it with much richness for all senses. 

Xo k"}
{"text":"I must say, the first time we went here in an extremely large group we had quite a negative experience. 
However, Hacienda more than redeemed itself with our next visit!
Was absolutely amazing from start to finish! The ceviche, faloutas, jerk lobster tacos, pollo tinga, la truck, braised short rib were all beyond delicious. And of the course, the churro poutine was the perfect ending! My personal favorite, the jerk lobster taco! May be too spicy for some, but I loved it!
Will definitely be back again, very soon!"}
{"text":"A group of six of us went last night, had reservations for two weeks and they couldn't find the reservation even though I confirmed the day before. We understand that it's tapas style and everything comes out when it's ready; however, one person wasn't served for 20 mins after we had all eaten AND that's only 20 mins because one of us had to go inquire for the fourth time where her tacos were. No one offered to comp her meal so we were stuck paying for it. We had also ordered a salad to go and the salad was MUCH smaller than the one that we had ordered earlier in the evening and it was missing ingredients. For what you pay and the false hype around this spot, none of us will be going back."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back here. Awful experience last night with a server who had a major attitude problem. Not to mention, they made our party sign a contract and we would be charged $100 if our party of 9 was missing ANY people. The restaurant's food isn't even that good to have a stupid policy like this. Not to mention, our party was limited to a smaller menu simply due to our party size."}
{"text":"Food: 4.5/5 The short ribs were great! Tacos were also great and very filling.  
Service: just alright ish but we had very very weird and pretentious stipulations placed on us (see below)
Price: pretty good 


We were a party of 8 so we were advised that we would only be able to order off a modified mini menu.  Also when ordering sides, we were told that no dietary accomdartins could be made on the corn that came with cheese on it.  In the end, our waitress agreed to ask if it was possible and it worked out thankfully.  We were also told that we would need to provide a credit card when reserving so that in case we didn't show up, they would charge us.  

We were automatically charged 18% gratuity even though we had very strange/PRETENTIOUS stipulations placed on us starting from the reservation style, mini modified menu, no alterning side orders unless you want all of them to come like that.  Some other things were also messed up on the bill.  

Our waitress was fine.  By no means outstanding but she was fine.  The food was prtty good.  I wouldn't go back only because of the very pretentious nature of our  experience."}
{"text":"The place looks promising when you walk in.  A sexy new taco place riding the current trend of Torontonians willing to pay increasing sums for fancy tacos.  This one definitely tests the limits.  Tacos range from $5 to $7 each, with a lobster version going for $12.   

So first off, the quality of the tacos does not justify the prices.  There is an \"LA Truck\" taco which attempts to rip off the famous Kogi kalbi taco, but falls so far off the mark it's not even worth getting into a comparison.  The pork and veggie tacos were also  disappointing (pork was dry and veg was lacking flavor or any kind of texture).  My friends had the fish tacos and said they were pretty good.  So, at least there's that.

The service is absolutely dismal.  Timing of everything is messed up, with servers neglecting our table while we sat with empty cups, and then finally taking a drink order and not delivering the drinks until our food had arrived and we were already done eating.  The upstairs is cramped and staff are constantly bumping into each other and customers trying to get around.

Hacienda is a superficial place, it's all style and no substance.  Like most of its clientele, it's loud, good looking, and expensive."}
{"text":"Ok- I'm not one to write reviews on Yelp often, ...but after Saturday night, I had to review this place.

After our attempt to go to Big Crow around the Corner from Hacienda went bust , we made a rezzo here for 10 ppl for 8 p.m. and had some drinks at Pourhouse nearby before.
 I love Playa Cabana and was hopeful this Mexican style place would live up to Playa , food-wise, it did pretty well ... but that's not the whole story here.
We weren't seated right away and instead shuffled about the narrow entryway/bar area for about 25 minutes and had some drinks before finally sitting down. This wasn't the biggest deal but we found ourselves jockeying for space in the tiny place with servers and other patrons.Our group of 10 were seated upstairs, a cool, dimly lit part of the restaurant with all sorts of vintage decor and old wooden chairs. '
on to the FOOD and DRINKS:

Margarita Paloma was my pick- basically a grapefruit margerita--loved it- chunky salt rim. not too sweet. yum.

It's small places for between 6-12$ a dish. I ordered the Mahi Mahi Ceviche, LA Food Truck Taco( beef)  and Fish tostada. All were delicious. The taco was my favourite-- Others around me had Lobster taco, popcorn shrimp, pork belly taco, steak taco, burrito -- everyone was happy with their orders.
----note that the food comes in increments, and it got a bit confusing as to WHO ordered what. Auctioning off food is annoying to me at restaurants -- ie : \"who ordered the xxxx?!?! \" so this was kind of a peeve for some of us. 

SERVICE
The young female servers were running around busily and generally did a good job of keeping us happy and getting the food out quickly. No one was overly personable, but they were all decent. 

HERE's where the BIG problem came..... near the end of our meal, some paid by cash, some needed Debit/Credit.. the restaurant claimed because of the rain their machines were down. Ok- surely, there's an ATM, right? NOPE ... we were told we can walk around the corner to a  convenience store to take out cash. 
So, off half of us shuffled off, in the rain  .... but the store was CLOSED. so we went to a bank a few blocks away.
When I came back, annoyed, but with cash in hand, I found out from the rest of our party that the owner had BLASTED one of my friends and SWORE at him incessantly after he complained and said he wanted some type of small compensation for the big headache..... needless to say other patrons were staring... 

yes, you read that correctly. the owner swore and screamed at my friend, oh and he THREATENED to call the Cops. the COPS!!! really. 
My calm, nice friend had told the owner we enjoyed the food, but were unhappy with how things were being handled with regards to the bill, not to mention our wait time before being seated prior to the meal.  and so he was on the receiving end of a screaming match.

I couldn't believe my ears upon hearing this.  Such a great dinner spoiled by disgusting and embarrassing customer service.

In short : Hacienda= great food, great ambience .....but the way the owner handled things left a SOUR taste in all our mouths... and not the kind of delicious sour you get from a good Margarita."}
{"text":"A cousin of playa cabana just down the road, we all know that already, this place is good and the food is good but it's just not a place you would put on your \"visit again\" list and here's why. 

Starting off with the fact that they gave away our reservation spot to the couple that walked in right in front of us and made us wait for a long time. how long I won't even tell you because you will say \"you should have just left\" and you know what? I should have, but for some unknown reason I stuck it out for 45 minutes. It was a warm summer night.  The reason they gave away our reservation is because the host(essess) have no idea what they're doing which is a big problem in a jam packed place like this. Whatevs I guess but that was shitty of them. 

As I just said, the place is JAMMED on a busy night which is awesome for them because that means they're raking it in, but it is also noisy as hell, hot and you're always on the lookout for someone walking into your chair while you're sipping on your drink.  The drink btw is great, strong and delicious. 

Food is pretty awesome too, you have a wonderful choice of all types of tacos and other mexican dishes. 

I can't tell you if the service was good because I can't remember which means that it is definitely not memorable but good enough to get the food to the table and give your reservation away to some random people casually strolling in.

Are the tacos better than at other mexican joints in the city? Most likely not BUT they are very well made ESPECIALLY that fresh and mouth watering ceviche. So if you're up for a trendy mexican kind of night, this is your go to place. Be prepared to be showered with sights of fake lips, short dresses and gym rat type guys whose shirts are too tight. A few hipsters here and there too."}
{"text":"Went to La Libre (the back patio) for the first time and loved the patio decor and atmosphere. We ordered a pitcher of Margaritas based on the server's suggestion and noticed that a single margarita was $10 - a pitcher which holds 4.5 drinks came up to $60. Not to sure how they came up with that pricing but $15 profit on a pitcher is steep. 

Food was alright - server didn't seem excited to be there and basically explained the tacos as being - chicken, pork or fish. Surprised to see how much small the tacos were compared to places like La Carnita and Grand Electric. 

Definitely wouldn't go back unless you paid me $15 to go!"}
{"text":"Booked a table for eight adults on a Wednesday night
Was told over the phone that because our number was more than six people we were only allowed to order appetisers and tacos Apparently the rest of the menu was off limits because of the large size of our party
So, no burritos or enchilatas for us?! WTF?
We were also given a late notice \"warning\"( on the smart phone that the table was booked on) TWO MINUTES after the designated time booking while parking the car
Ordered cocktails and food
Two guests at the table received their mains about 20 minutes later
Ten minutes later two more guests received their mains
So half an hour in only half of our table has been served dinner?!
The other half of the table is sitting there w nothing in front of them and the guests w food 
are still waiting for everyone else to get their food while it all goes cold
Another ten minutes three more mains come to the table and we finally start to eat but WAIT
we are still short one entrée that apparently is NOT coming
Asked a server/food runner about said entrée and was assured that she would check on it for us ... NOTHING!
No one came to the table after that to reply/inform us of the final plates arrival
FIFTEEN MINUTES later our original server asked how everything is
We told him about the wait times for all of the food and just left the table and went to the kitchen
to check on the last entrée Well I guess he was now embarrassed and quickly presented the final entrée ( on the house ) for the last remaining guest FINALLY
By this time everyone had pretty much finished dinner so that last entrée was just packed up to go because the unfortunate guest didn't feel comfortable eating alone at a table of eight 
and was really just \"over it\"
The food itself was good when we finally got it  Ive been to many many Mexican restaurants in my life and it wasn't the best nor the worst but ive got to say the service was SHITE!
Attitude and a general sense that they were doing us a big favour for serving to begin with kinda left a sour taste in the mouth
Next time ill go to CHULA on Gerrard at Jones for
Better food/prices
Friendly service/no attitude
Peace Out"}
{"text":"Came here last weekend for a friend's birthday. We made reservations, so seating did not take too long. The ambiance is upbeat and friendly. The metallic signs and neon lights add a nice decor to the restaurant. It was really packed on the Saturday night. It was hard to manoeuvre around other diners and servers. Our server was nice, and she explained the items on the menu. She gave us her recommendations, and since there was a group of 8 of us we were going to share. Most of the tacos were good. The stand out was the short rib tacos. I was not a big fan of the chorizo taco because it lacked flavour and it was dry. Overall, the food was good. Since it was our friend's birthday, the servers came out to sing happy birthday and she had to wear a huge sombrero. The only negative was that I was sitting at the end of the table, and the servers rearranged the tables next us so that I was blocked in. Ya, I know the place is tight, but it shows the lack of foresight on their part. Good place to have fun and food."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place after visiting Playa Cabana. The main floor definitely has a cool vibe. However, we got seated on the 3rd floor. It was really cramped and we were sitting near the window. It was the furthest table from the stairs and found it hard to get the waitress' attention. There was a time we signalled to her and she mentioned she'd be back in a minute that turned into 12. Also, the wait staff kept sending food to the wrong table. We ordered beef tacos. I guess it got sent to the wrong table so they sent it back to the kitchen. The waitress comes back saying, didn't you order the tacos? We said yes. And she asked why we sent it back then. We explained it never came. Don't think she apologized. The food was nothing particularly special. The Palermo cocktail was delicious though. Invest in those to blur out the poorer service and food that's \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Toronto's best Mexican restaurant! They are so consistently good! Every time I go back, I get the same great tasty food and awesome service! The (fried) fish taco is simply, perfect! SOOO GOOD..must try! unlike all the other mexican/taco places in Toronto, Hacienda actually has good portion sizes and you leave feeling full!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here around 9 PM on a weeknight and got a couple of great seats at the bar right away. I couldn't go to a new Playa without sampling the margaritas, and I found their signature marg to be right on point. Totally refreshing and complimentary to the food.  

We ordered orders of three for both the Baja fried fish taco and the shortrib tacos in the crispy shell. This is not a small amount of food! Each taco is very generous. My favourite was the tender and tangy braised shortrib taco. The crispy shell is such a fun indulgence. 

Loved seeing the huge, plump pieces on the fried fish tacos but once I got to the middle, it was raw. My friend is quite seasoned at coming here, and she said the fish tacos were way bigger than usual, so perhaps that was the reason. At least for fish, I'd rather under than overcooked! 

Still, a very fun stop in with seriously friendly service. Would return and give a larger portion of the menu a try!"}
{"text":"One star is way too many for this garbage joint.  Taco shells were oily - fried fish was tasteless, cabbage was the only thing I can taste.  Ribs were drier than beef jerky from gas station but server didn't care after my complaint.   

Service was bad as well. Two tables walked out that night because they didn't get food!  Maybe they were short staff on a sat night but I wouldn't want to pay another $50 to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Creative menu , very nice staff. Great night with dinner and drinks. We will go back for sure. LA truck taco was reordered at our table a few times. We are not sure if we like playa cabana or playa hacienda ."}
{"text":"Pretty decent tacos! Tried the chicken tinga and steak. Both had a lot of flavour. They have lobster tacos too that id like to try next time. Nice decor with a lot of cool features and antiques. Very excellent service. Will be back to try more of their dishes and hope to try out some of their other locations."}
{"text":"The cocktails were great but the food was just so so.  The tacos are prepared to look good when delivered by they're a pain in the ass to eat - just way too much filler like shredded cabbage.   It's also not a comfortable spot - I don't mind seating that is packed close, it can actually add to the atmosphere, but here the staff don't have any room to deliver food or move around.  I don't want a waiter hanging over my table so the other waiter can squeeze by to deliver food.  The \"original\" down the street has it right, this place is trying too hard to be cool."}
{"text":"To steal a phrase from everybody's favourite TV dad, the food here is... Groin-Grabbingly Transcendent!! Seriously though, the food was not undelicious."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Great both indoors and in the patio out back. The seafood platter in the outdoor restaurant is off the charts. On a nice summer eve, the back garden restaurant is hard to beat"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place for the first time on Friday night. The food was delicious and the service was excellent. He had a chicken burrito and I had a beef enchilada. Both of us were very happy with our meals.The nachos and guac were great and the guac portion was more than decent. The tables are quite the tight fit but otherwise this was a great experience. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Although its still busy, the food has seriously fallen off. I don't know what happened to this place- It used to be a great spot to go to in the area.   I had the Chrizo, braised short rib and Pulpo (Octopus) tacos. The tacos were so sloppy and fell apart the minute i picked them up. They were also really bland. The worst part was the server came to check up on us maybe twice the entire meal. I literally had to get up to find our server so we could order another round of drinks."}
{"text":"Very tight narrow restaurant. Probably seats more people than they should. The service is friendly and always pleasant.

If you're looking for a down to earth mexican place to unwind with friends with good food and friendly staff this would be the place.  I find the food always consistent, delicious, fresh and relatively affordable. 

P.S I love the Guac and Chips! They come warm and with a GENEROUS portion of guacamole! Great way to start a mexican meal!"}
{"text":"So I'm gonna start of by stating that I often don't give terrible reviews but holy shit that was the worst experience ever. NEVER GOING BACK...

Just walked out after being there for two hours. Took probably an hour at least to get the first part of our meal. After hitting the two hour mark we finally asked our server to cancel the rest of the meal and asked for our bill. As someone who works in the hospitality business I was honestly shocked that no one came over to apologize and no one ever offered to comp anything. 

The restaurant was a little busy in the beginning but wasn't too crazy for an hour wait time for food. Our server tried her best and kept giving us chips... but realistically we came to eat tacos not chips. 
 
Long story short - would give 0 stars if i could. Will never be returning."}
{"text":"Taco places have been popping up around Toronto recently and this is one of the latest. A quaint restaurant right off Dupont and Avenue, there was a huge line up in. Braving to sit on the recently rained-on patio furniture, we quickly ordered. Corn for starters, followed by fish tacos, LA truck tacos and braised ribs tacos, we ate in gusto. The food was nicely presented and tasty but small considering it's a 5$ dollar taco. The margarita was similarly expensive and underwhelming. The service was also very attentive but disorganized.  

Do not bring someone here on a first date unless you want them to see you reading messily with your hands and face. I think some wet naps would've gone a long way.

Overall a nice little taco joint with a slightly higher price tag."}
{"text":"This is actually a cool place good food and staff that is knowledgable about the food, which comes pretty darn fast. After you've been served though the service is a little bit shit.

The best thing about this place is the back patio; however I've been to this place 4 times and only once was the back patio open, and all four times it wasn't raining. I think I'm a little fed up with this place to be honest. When the patio is closed good luck getting a seat and it's very frustrating when they don't open the back patio (which can hold about half the amount of people that the inside can hold).

If you're a risk taker, go to this place. When it's good the decision to go here really pays off. In my experience most of the time it's not."}
{"text":"I came here with three friends after we tried to get into their other restaurant just up the street. It was a Friday night, and I didn't realize that reservations are such a must in Toronto! Anyway, we rocked up, and waited by the bar until a table popped up for us (maybe about 20 minutes). It was a bit weird that there was no bartender, so there was no way for us to order a drink or anything as we waited, which would make for happier customers probably.

anyway, we had a pretty decent table at the back near the kitchen, which wasn't too disruptive and we got to check out all the dishes leaving the kitchen. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas to share. Our waiter, who was really great, asked whether we preferred more sweet or sour margaritas, and also asked about putting salt on the rim, both of which were appreciated as all of us much prefer a more sour drink, and one of us doesn't like salted rims. I like the idea that the style is kind of tapas-y, but at the same time, it makes it hard when people have different tastes or dietary needs and can't share with the group. As a vegetarian, there wasn't much choice for tacos, so I opted for a burrito, whereas one friend and my boyfriend ordered tacos, and another friend who wasn't so hungry just got guacamole. The guac came super quickly, and the tacos all arrived randomly. The waiter had told us to eat things as they came out of the kitchen, as it would arrive at different times. While this was good advice, it meant we were all eating at different times. The burrito took the longest to arrive, so basically everyone had finished their tacos by the time my food came. It was just a bit awkward, and doesn't make for a good group dinner spot. If you come with one other person, and share tacos then it would be perfect, but for us I didn't think it was the best. Also, the burrito was good, but not the best. My friend and boyfriend who had tacos enjoyed them, but thought some of them were a bit salty or boring. As tacos are the specialty, they should be well-seasoned and inspired.

Overall, we had a fun evening because this is a cool spot, and is quite noisy so you can share a pitcher of margaritas and have fun while doing it. Also our waiter was really great. She was very attentive, and even packed up my friend's guacamole with some extra chips for her to take home. I think it's a bit expensive for what we had and the quality of the food (around $35 per person), so I don't think I'd be in a rush to come back."}
{"text":"Chicken burrito was on of the best I've had. Food is quite spicy. Service was quick but food was just warm."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years but their menu has evolved significantly and I just went here tonight so probably the best time to write a review. Atmosphere and decor are great. 

Short rib taco: ultimate classic. Wish the cheese was cheesier like back in the day but the juiciness and taste of the rib is unparalleled 

Vegan taco: yummy and spicy with lots of veggies. Seasoning is on point and it was so warm. 

Baja fish: the slaw makes it and the fish is so soft but flavourful. Soft taco is perfect for this. 

Shrimp taco: amazing - very mild. Would like to now try the spicy shrimp on the soft shell but the hard shell went so well though! 

Duck quesadilla: our wonderful waitress Jesse recommended these - they were GOOD but they weren't my personal favourite. 

Service was amazing and Jessie ensured we were taken care of. Never too far away when we needed to bug her for something. She was so pleasant and easy to communicate with. 

5 stars because this is definitely one of the most solid Mexican restaurant choices you will find in Toronto and I've been to a number of them in the city. Tacos are always warm, drinks are tad bit expensive but they're delicious and guac is on point. Great for date night, groups, or just a night out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were asked if we wanted to be seated in the back patio area where the menu is much smaller. I am vegan so I said I was fine with it as long as there was something I could eat as a main course. The waiter said that the special of the day was a veggie pizza. I asked if it had cheese, to which he said he wasn't sure but he would ask, then he came right back to say no, it did not. It was also written on the specials board, where it listed the ingredients (it did not list cheese). What mattered though, is that the host said it didn't have cheese.

So we we ordered chips and guacamole for starter, I ordered the pizza, my bf ordered his main. So when the main ends up coming, the pizza has cheese on it. My server and I realized the error that had occurred here and I asked if they could please remake it without cheese. He said the kitchen does not do modifications. He then asked if there was anything else I could order but I said no because I specifically sat in the back patio area because the host specifically said the pizza did not have cheese. 
Then he asked if we wanted to cancel my bf's food too, probably thinking we would just go because I can't eat anything else. He did not offer to discount our bill of the drinks and chips and guacamole we ate. I honestly would have expected more than just, \"I'm sorry, the host is new here\"... he would not accommodate the fact that I am vegan and that I was told that the food I was getting was too. Very rude. He did not offer to discount our meal. 

The server's politeness did not make up for the lack of effort and caring about your customers."}
{"text":"Hmm...
Came here to eat last night and sad to say this was not my favorite experience in Toronto. I've already done overpriced taco joints with loud music (see the Grand Electric) and to me its kind of an overdone fad. 

Where to start: the tables are kinda jammed together and you can't help but ease drop. They might as well go for communal pick nick tables with how close everyone is seated. 

Service. As a consequence of the cluttered seating I was constantly getting jostled by the servers as they moved the food. At one point my coat slipped off my chair and our waiter picked it up, while scolding me for my chair hanging abilities. He also forgot my tequila. 

Food:  Had a plate of guac and chips and three tacos: LA truck (steak bavette) the short rip and the fish taco. All were decent , with crunchy garnish and decent sauce. I was tempted by the three for 15 ( but you can only get one kind), so each was $6.  The guac was nothing special

So here is the rub. The ambiance and service were not great and the food wasn't good enough to rescue it. There are lots stellar low end Mexican options around. (Check out St Clair and Kensington Market) and really good high end Mexican at Valdez.  

This may be a cheap night out for the couple next to me who were reading a Toronto star article about themselves and kept calling the premier \"my friend Kathleen\" but I will take more affordable and just as well cooked Mexican at places like Emporium Latino and Azteca."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great however I found the food was just ok.  I got  the chicken enchiladas which was amazing but I found the rice was undercooked and the beans were overcooked so my meal felt incomplete but I will go back and try the tacos and some alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my sister's birthday and we had a good experience. There were some gluten and dairy free options on the menu (phew) and I ordered the pollo tinga.  To make the pollo tinga gluten and dairy free, I had them omit some of the toppings.  Even without all of the toppings, I found my tacos to be quite yummy.

We also ordered the guacamole and chips. They were really good and I highly recommend them.  However, I'm not totally sure everything I ate was gluten free because I did experience some digestive issues during the meal.  Luckily, it was nothing too serious but I did feel really uncomfortable.

The good news is, my sister had a wonderful time!  She had a bunch or tacos and ordered the churros for dessert.  The churros are served in a chocolate pudding, which made the experience more memorable.

Our waiter was also really nice but the service was kind of slow.  I think the restaurant was understaffed.  This restaurant was packed and I don't believe they had one empty table.  The entire time we were there, I did not see our waiter take one break.  He was go-go-go!  Our waiter forgot to bring us condiments, beverages and cutlery when asked. On average, it would take about 30 minutes for any additional requests to be met.  His amazing personality helped ease the situation while some of us were waiting for things we needed to go with our meals.

The one thing I really did not like about this restaurant was they provided our table of 12 people with one bill.  That made paying quite difficult at the end of the night because everyone ordered tons of tapas, drinks and it was hard to figure out how much each person owed.  It would have been much easier to have separate bills or the bill divided by seat.

Allover, it is possible I might return to this restaurant for another dining experience, since I noticed they have ceviche on the menu and I would love to try it."}
{"text":"Got a Street Style Pollo Tinga Burrito from Uber Eats. 

It was delicious and not too bloating. A bit on the pricy side for a burrito though, not sure if it's cheaper in store. I probably won't be ordering it off uber eats again, but if I'm near the actual restaurant, I'll be sure to grab a bite there."}
{"text":"I've been to the Original Playa Cabana, Bar Correano, and tonight, we visited the Hacienda. While I was not so impressed with Bar Correano, and I loved the original, I found Hacienda to be a charming medium. The chips were great as were all the salsas. Short Rib tacos were nothing short of amazing, but I found that there was less meat in these ones than the ones I ordered from the original location down the street. We also tried the LA Truck tacos, but we both agreed that the Short ribs are the best!

Margaritas are great and never too sweet. We started off with a house cocktail made of mint, strawberry, tequila and lime. I can't remember the name, but they were refreshing and delicious.

Our server was great. So professional, always making sure that things were cleared off our table and returning to ask if we needed more drinks, chips or water. She was actually very sweet with zero hipster ennui.

I might even have given 5 stars, but there was a family of kids beside us and the kids were all up out of their seats and being loud and whiny. I know this is not the fault of the restaurant, but it's really annoying. Leave your kids at home, cuz I was smart enough not to have them and don't want to fit yours into my comfortable adult lifestyle. When I was a kid I would have been whacked for getting up out of my seat and complaining about the food. 

From now on, when kids start acting up beside me, I'm going to get really drunk and start burping. 

Overall a super solid place for yummy Mexican food and I will be back!"}
{"text":"SLOW service, food was cold and WAY overpriced ($9 for a scoop of guac and $6 for a miniature bowl of salsa?!?!?).  Sad that they consider themselves an authentic Mexican resto... I've had way better!  Decor was alright, but the space was very constricting.  If you can skip this restaurant all together, I would suggest you do,"}
{"text":"The menu didn't state cilantro. When our order arrived we told our server there was an allergy. The response was \"sorry we don't make modifications to our food\". Horrible experience, expect the same attitude when you go."}
{"text":"A friend suggested we go eat here as she had heard really good reviews about it. Went for lunch and sat outside on the patio. The place is nicely decorated and had a very chill vibe. 

We ordered the elotes to start. I don't know how they made corn taste so amazing. The sauce on it was out of this world. I have never had corn this good. It was a bit pricey at $10 though. Then we order 4 different taco platters to share. We got:  Pollo Tinga (chicken), Braised Short rib, Chorizo Verde and LA Truck Taco. All but the LA Truck Taco come in a crispy shell, but you can ask for then in a soft shell which I preferred. The LA Truck Taco was my favourite but they were all really good. They all had nice fresh toppings on them. 

For dessert we order the Churros poutine and the Tres Leches cake. I grew up eating churros so I have really high expectations for them. These were just as good as the ones that I get back home. There were served with marshmallows and a dulce de leche sauce. The Tres Leches cakes was nice and surprisingly refreshing for something so sweet.

Our server (I think his name was Anthony) was very helpful in making suggestions and was attentive without being constantly at our sides. 

Great food, great service and great ambience. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best short rib burrito ever as was the Tijuana mile! Great service as well...definitely will stay on list for future visits!"}
{"text":"Very happy with the menu choices and service. I kept seeing things go to other tables that I can't wait to go back and try. It's not your typical greasy \"Tex mex\" restuarant.  These ingredients are very fresh. It's a well designed menu!"}
{"text":"By far playa cabana has the Best Mexican in Toronto! Again I have tried many and coming from LA I have high standards but give me a break toronto mexican food is pathetic, and then we tried playa cabana wow what a pleasant change, it's not trying to be fancy it just damn good authentic Cali Mexican cuisine! 

Can't wait for them to open one downtown!"}
{"text":"The Playa Cabana Hacienda was a great restaurant to eat at. We had a great time from start to finish. The food was prepared well and brought out in good time. The prices are a bit on the higher side ($15.00 for 3 Tacos) but in my opinion still worth it. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Playa Cabana Hacienda -

Great brand - but needs some work on the drinks / pricing.  I guess it makes sense from their perspective to only sell single tacos for double the price from down the road, where it's difficult to get a reservation.  I had a tequila cesar but they rimmed the glass with margarita salt, so that wasn't the greatest.  

Great food - but expensive for what you get.  Points on the decor though, really cool vibe.  A place to go for a quick drink and maybe a taco - but dinner gets expensive quickly."}
{"text":"Well Playa Cabana quickly realized they were onto something with their first location on Dupont, and wasted no time in opening another restaurant just a stone's throw down the road! Playa Cabana Hacienda, as they call it, is two floors with seating indoors and outside on a front patio (I believe they are also opening up a back patio). They've decorated in much a similar fashion to the original Playa Cabana, but slightly less rustic and more industrial. 

The food came relatively quickly (although at different times) and was good, but not mind-blowing, which is what I would expect for their prices. I had the mojito, which was delicious, but again not sure it was worth the price. The menu at Hacienda is tapas-style, so the expense quickly adds up when you realize you just got one tiny taco for $6 or a tostada for $9. Their menu is pretty small right now but I'm guessing it will grow as they are open for longer. 

Overall, I'll probably go here again for the convenience factor (it's essentially in my backyard and there is a serious lack of restaurants in the area) but don't let all the hype fool you."}
{"text":"Get the guac/salsa and chips - freshly prepared and super tasty.

Tacos are hit or miss - it depends on which ones you order. Personally, I think the Baja fish and Braised shortrib are the best. They are generously filled and soooo good. 

Drinks are really expensive and I find that they are filled with LOTS of ice - easily pushes a $50-60 bill (for two people) to over $100 with drinks."}
{"text":"Now, you should know that I absolutely love Playa Cabana. Seriously. I'm like their number one fan girl. I love that place. So giving PCH a two-star review is not easy for me. But it is a bit necessary based mostly on the service here. Let me explain:

I've been in here a few times at night for a drink with some friends and to share some appetizers. It is so well decorated in here and has a perfect, neighbourhoody feel to it which would make it an excellent place to share a beer or a mojito amongst pals. Right? Well...not really according to PCH. I always feel rushed when I'm in here. The servers are not afraid to let you know when they're ready to close (even if it's a solid 2 hours before their posted closing time). I've had servers turn the lights on bright in the restaurant, wipe down my table while we still are finishing our drinks, take away our half-eaten appetizers (thinking that we're done...or implying that we should be), and serve us our bill way before we were ready to leave. And again, this is all at like 10pm, which is super weird because they're billed to stay open until 2am (except on Sundays when they close at 11). This sort of service just really annoys me. 

The other thing that makes me less than impressed by PCH is the price of the food here in comparison to Playa Cabana. You're paying more for tacos here...tacos that are the exact same as those you could get at Playa Cabana. That's weird to me. I don't get why I'd pay more for the same taco at a place that might look cooler but treats me with less consideration. 

All in all, just go to Playa Cabana. You'll be happier in the end."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a party of 6. The food was decent and the service was only okay. You can find the same food elsewhere for cheaper.. the Grand Electric on Queen st is the same style food. The service was a bit slow...."}
{"text":"Yesterday was a beautiful warm night in the city and my partner and I decided to go on a drive to find a nice patio to sit on. We were driving down avenue road when something caught our eyes. I immediately turned around because we had a good feeling about this place. We parked and walked over and we're promptly greeted and seated. We were a bit sad that the patios and kitchen close at 11 and we got there at 10:50, so we sat inside and made our orders quickly. I still wish we could've sat on the patio :)

We got our drinks and the guacamole and chips, so good. Freshly fried corn chips and the guacamole was delicious too. And then our tacos came which were amazing too. I got 3 chicken tacos and my partner got the vegan tacos and both tasted really great! There was a selection of hot sauces at the table and all of them were fun to test and try out, and turned out to be really good :)

The menu was small but exactly what was needed. Not overwhelming - you kinda know what you're getting when you come in and it's all on that menu. Gluten free and vegan options available!!

The music and overall atmosphere here is hard to top. Raggaeton and salsa music playing all night to really make you feel like you're somewhere on vacation.

I loved this place so much, truly a hidden gem. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"When has a restaurant jumped the proverbial shark?  I just had a textbook experience.

Having spent a decade in California where great Mexican food in hip digs is not so unique, my wife and I were happy to find this place, not minding the overpriced but yummy tacos.  We've been several times, recommended it, etc.  Until now. 

I called to make a ressie for a quick bite at 6, explaining that we needed to be out by 7 to make a movie.  The person who took the call said no problem, and took down my details.

Then the auto-text spam began.  First the reminder of the upcoming reservation, then the re-reminder, and then the notification that our reservation had been cancelled as we pulled up just before 6.  Apparently their auto reservation system only works in 1 1/2 hour intervals, and so we had been entered as a 5:30 reservation.  OK, no problem.  And yet...

In the restaurant, I was told by a male maître d'/ shift manager that the only table available was a high top wedged beside the front door.  Now, my wife is pregnant, susceptible to drafts and uncomfortable at high tops.  I looked out over the virtually empty restaurant (one table occupied) and turned to the aforementioned Person of Great Authority - that was his bearing.

\"How about that table over there?\"
\"It's reserved for 7\".
\"Great... we need to be out of here by 7\".
\"It's a 4 top... I'd have to pull the tables apart\".
That didn't seem like a huge effort, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt.  
\"Just leave them together, we'll only use one\".  
\"Your reservation was for 5:30\"
\"No, I called and made a reservation with a human being for 6, and told her we needed to be out by 7\".  
\"I can't give you that table.  It's reserved for 7\".
All of this delivered with an attitude of snark turned up to eleven.  That was it for me.  

As I left, I found myself recalling the early Toronto restaurant scene, when decent restaurants were few and further between and wait staff often seemed to expect gratitude that they were deigning to serve you.  In California, I discovered that great food and great service are a combination for long-term success, and I've been delighted to find that most good Toronto restaurants now understand that.  Not so the Playa Cabana - Hacienda.  Fortunately, I have lots of options.  Next..."}
{"text":"I ordered from here using UberEATS, so my review is solely on their food. 

A group of us ordered short rib tacos, short rib enchiladas, and pollo enchiladas. 

We were surprised at how small the servings were for the price. All of us finished our meals within minutes and were still hungry. 

Tacos were lacking sauces, which made them a bit on the dry side. The enchiladas were smaller than what I am used to and just ok. I wasn't blown away by them and neither were my friends. The sauces on the enchiladas were also skimpy. The rice that came with our meals were dry and tasteless and the black beans were decent at best. 

Maybe their dine in food experience is better because the food wasn't sitting in take out boxes for a few minutes, but that doesn't explain the lack of sauces and flavours. 

We are on our way to get mcdonalds as I write this."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and snacks at 9 Saturday. It was very busy. We did have reso's but the place was a lot smaller than we thought and very crowded. If your not claustrophobic. You'll be fine. But it's cramped and lively. No doubt. Service was decent and prices moderate for the area. The guacamole is great - they will refill ur chips but they're super deep fried. Pass. Tried the tacos ( delicious) and shrimp app. Very good food. Tapas style. Loved the decor. Great for a night out but don't know if I'll become a regular."}
{"text":"So good, great service, wish there were more clean, fresh veggie options."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I've got a fairly large group at a somewhat last minute. They are always super accommodating to whatever group I bring by, with friendly service and good food. 

The food is a bit spicy, however that's pretty typical for taco places. The braised short rib tacos are delicious. Highly recommend anything with guac too. 

What I absolutely adore is the drinks !!! So yummy, and fairly priced. They have quite the list of reposados, anejos and blancos making the experience that much better if you love tequila. The cocktails are DELICIOUS. I have yet to try one that I don't like, sangria has to top it all though. 

One downside to an experience that I had was a simple miscommunication with the service. Bless our server, he was quite busy and obviously wasn't expecting a large party but he refused to split the cheques despite us keeping things quite simple and with no prior knowledge that this was even a policy. I've been here plenty of times with large groups and never once have I encountered this. I don't have a problem with one bill, but the people that I did with. My party had to add everything up on their own, however after speaking with him by myself he was able to split them. It just was a lot of trouble for nothing."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! Like the other Playa Cabana restaurants in Toronto, this place made me love Mexican food. The tacos here are out of this world. The jerk lobster taco is without a doubt one of the best tacos I have eaten in Toronto. The restaurants is three floors and has a patio out back. Service is always good and food is always delivered quickly. Although pricy, I am always craving for more."}
{"text":"Came here in the summer with no reservations and they were able to accommodate our group of 8! Everyone was very kind and willing to help us understand the menu and the tacos they serve. There was only one bad apple but she might've just tolerated my loud group enough to where she didn't care anymore. 
In terms of food, we knew this location was the reported the best of the chain restaurants. I ordered the braised rib tacos and pulpo (octopus). Both were very flavourful and easy to fill you up! The pulpo is the most worth it in my opinion, my taco looked like an entree as I ate the filling with a fork! Only issue is that is is very spicy to the mild mouth (me), I'm sure it burned a hole in my stomach but I would do it again!"}
{"text":"I remember this place being a whole lot better than it was when I went this week.  Our elotes (corn) arrived cold, and didn't have a ton of flavour other than the heat. I had three tacos: jerk lobster, pescado, and soy chorizo. The jerk lobster cost $14 and was a huge let down.  There were a few tiny bits of lobster and the flavour was weird. The soy chorizo was gross (and I don't eat meat, so this isn't my first time having vegan options) - I had one bite and didn't finish it.  The pescado was the best of the three. 

My partner had an enchilada and was much happier with his choice, but ordered a jerk lobster taco and felt the same way I did. 

If you stick to the basics (guac and chips, beans and rice, fish tacos), this place is fine. Otherwise, you may be disappointed."}
{"text":"Would I go back? Nope.
I've been to 3 playa cabanas now, and I just don't get the hype. The food is mediocre at best.
Order: LA truck- really tender flank steak pieces topped with standard slaw and shredded lettuce. This was the only item I enjoyed. 

Also ordered chicken Tinga and a queso con something taco- both were unfortunately not flavourful enough to balance the strong taste of corn tortillas. 

I just don't like corn tortillas.

Anyway, this location has a beautiful breezy rooftop patio deck, but if I didn't have good company, I wouldn't have even gone for the food."}
{"text":"The food - four stars and a half -
 the food was really good,we ordered a few different tacos and we liked them all, they have different options for the tortilla; soft tortilla, fried tortilla (tostada almost), lettuce \"tortilla\" (you use the lettuce as the tortilla) 
As dessert we had the churros poutine AMAZING, if you love cajeta (it's a thicker version of Dulce de leche) you will enjoy this very very much.
My hubby and I wanted to also try the dark chocolate cake and they were out of it.

The drinks - two stars - 
Ok.. I work in the industry and sometimes that makes me criticize a lot and expect a lot, thankfully I got my hubby who tells me when I am exaggerating, sadly this time it wasn't me it was the bartender. 
We were seating right beside the bar in the patio at the back of the restaurant (very cool patio) I got a drink menu different my hubby we didn't notice until I ordered a drink and I was told I couldn't order from that menu because that was the inside menu.. Anyways I ordered the sangria and he ordered Dave's Margarita, my drink was not good, not bad, nothing special... My hubby's drink was ok. We saw the bartender really struggling making the drinks, no measurements and not rinsing the shakers. I decided I didn't want another drink, I didn't have lots of options and I didn't like the idea of having my drinks in plastic cups (that it's probably an Ontario law or something, but still) however my husband ordered a second one and let me tell you, the \"Margarita\" was white and it didn't taste like the first one at all, it tasted mainly like fake lime.. I understand she was busy and I understand sometimes you don't have time to measure the exact amount of each ingredient but you have ONE job and it's making drinks, that's why you should try every drink that you make, just like a chef in the kitchen you have to know you are giving quality drinks and most of all consistency.   

The place itself (decor, ambience) five stars 
The place it's sooo cool, love the decor, love the location, the rustic feeling. 

The service was ok, they were busy, 
I asker my server coffee and she said no coffee was served in the patio but we saw people having Coffee so we asked the manager if there was coffee allowed in the patio and she said yes of course... 

We are probably gonna go back and seat inside, make a reservation (they were full inside and the wait was an hour) and hope the bartender inside has a clue in the drink making."}
{"text":"Love their gauc and chips as well as the fish tacos. Daves margharitas pitchers Are my go to drink and it always makes for a good night. Love the playa restos, this one is much larger than the original and just as good. 

Only downside being they do not offer the fish burrito at this location, while to original location does."}
{"text":"Having lived in the US for several years I have got used to quality Mexican food and thought that would be one of the things I would really miss in Toronto when I moved back. Now it seems Toronto has really stepped up its game in the past few years as I see many Mexican restaurants around the city with quality food. Playa Cabana is a very good example of that. They offer great tacos selections, good margarita and a cool atmosphere. The restaurant is cozy and it is very nicely decorated with colorful lights and decorations and a rustic feeling that's very popular these days. The service is plenty and very friendly. The tacos were right on. We tried the Baja, the red snapper, LA truck and braised short ribs. They were all great. I specially liked the baja. We also got the Elotes which are the corn on the cobs. They are always one of my favorite appetizers. I found theirs to not have as much cheese and a bit low on salt but corn is always good anyway. The margarita was tasty but as it is the case with drinks at every restaurant north of the border they were pretty small. 
I'm used to paying less for Mexican food but i guess i have to get use the higher prices.
Would definitely go back again.

Food:4.5/5
Service and atmosphere:5/5
Price: 3.5/5
Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Hacienda is a local & we go all the time - there are some great things about it and definitely recommend, but it is nowhere near as good as the actual Playa Cabana down the street.  for pure food & authenticity I highly recommend the mother restaurant.  For a good time, call Hacienda...if you know what I mean ;)

Hacienda - new lay-out is way better and there is always a great crowd.  We love the Dave's Margarita, the guacamole, the shrimp (though very rich) and most of the tacos - I think my favourites are pastor, steak & chicken, but all are good.  
-There is sometimes a bit of chaos - delays in tables, mixed messages from staff, etc - sometimes you wait forever & others when you feel rushed - plus they don't have some of our fav items from the main menu - including the salad & spicy mole...Overall a great night out and worth the $$

La Libre - So I am extra excited to see a new and very cool patio in the 'hood - they did a great job on the layout / decor, but my positives end there.
-They are trying to make La Libre separate - big mistake if you ask me.  Most of the following could be easily tweaked and make this patio the best in the area:
a) Slow slow drink service - I have been three times and in all cases the drinks took forever!  
b)Warm guac in metal bowl - they usually serve you fresh guac, but for whatever reason at La Libre is not making fresh guac or serving their awesome habenero hot sauce outside either 
c) Dry Pork - THe make your own taco platter with spit fired pork is 4/10 - dry and lacking flavour - too bad because this is their 'specialty' according to the servers
d)Not enough items & very little in terms of healthy choices

Hoping that La Libre gets their sea legs and goes on to be amazing food-wise...for now I am only going for drinks..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped in here early one Friday evening (around 6pm) and managed to get a table with our promise of leaving in under 1.5 hours, before the next reservation came. We had been to Playa Cabana, down the street, earlier in the week for lunch and wanted to try this place as well.

While the experience at Playa Cabana was quite decent (sunny patio atmosphere combined with above average food) Hacienda was a hot mess. The atmosphere was the only positive point (especially decor) although I can't comment on what it might be like later in the evening when trendy couples take the places of family groups.

In any case, we spent about $110 on food (no drinks, incl. 20% tip) and left pretty disappointed. The pico was uncharacteristically bitter; the guacamole much worse than Playa's; the fish tacos, worse; the jerk lobster, lacking flavor. Overall, disappointment after having had a good time at Playa Cabana earlier in the week. 

Another thing that threw me off was the service. There seemed to be about a million wait staff buzzing around (at least one per patron) but the service was tremendously slow and disorganized. To be honest, there were so many people to \"take over for xxx because she's busy\" that I don't know who was actually serving us. Again, this would have been no problem had there not been so many servers wandering around, chatting amongst themselves, making no attempt to look busy. 

I would not return here, however, if you're in the mood for Mexican, I'd encourage you to try Hacienda's sister, Playa Cabana just down the street."}
{"text":"It was my second time and I think my last.  While my first experience was okay,  the second was a flop.  We made reservations so we could experience the full menu indoors, but the host had no record of it!  He was only able to seat us outside with no effort to compensate.  The waiter was hard to track down,  one of our orders was missed,  and we had to share a table with another group and climb over a bench to get there. 

While it's a cool spot and the food is pretty good,  the service needs some serious help."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me and on my last night in toronto a small group of us made an early reservation to get a prime seat on the front patio.

I can't remember what it was called but I ordered a cocktail with ginger beer in it. High recommended! I only had 1 - but if I didn't have to fly the net day I would have had a few more - fantastically unexpected bite!

Started with chips and salsa and guacamole - seriously could have made a meal of these and almost did. Chips were served warm. We were all in our glory!

Nadine and Karen and I decided to split two orders of tacos which ended up being a perfect amount of food - short ribs on one side and LA truck (I think they were called) on the other. Equally delicious. Howard ordered tacos with poblano peppers and cheese and ate all 3 without a peep so I know him enjoyed them! We also shares an order of corn on the cob for the table. I would love to find the recipe - they were a major hit with our table!

We topped of the meal by splitting a churro a poutine between the four of us. The churro a were delicious on their own but the hot Carmel sauce and melting marshmallows added to the experience - and there were 4 in the order so we were all happy!

Service also should be noted as it was fantastic. Very good recommendations - we took them all - and very pleasant attitude. She went to find out what was on the corn for us and was back in seconds with the ingredients. Haylen always had a smile on her face and everyone there seemed really nice - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Way too loud and crowded!   This is not a relaxing place, I had servers bumping into me all night, our table was move after 2 hours, and my throat hurt after talking so loud all night.  You're supposed to go to a restaurant to relax, not shout and feel claustrophobic.  There was not a vegetarian option tacos either, which I was not impressed with.  Not recommended.  Bad atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yum - this place has great food!  Got the guac and chips...the chips were slightly greasy for my taste...but the guac was nice and fresh and creamy.  Just lovely.  Ordered the beef tacos - really yummy and tender...but tiny!  The portion size of the guac/chips is bigger than then tacos!  Overall the cool vibe and the great food will make me come back again.  Our server was really nice - explained the menu to us (twice!) without seeming impatient or upset we were asking a few questions (due to some allergies in the group).  Can't wait to go back and try a few other things on the menu...ole!  (yeah...ended on a cheesy note...!)"}
{"text":"I'm not nearly as impressed with Hacienda as I am with Playa Cabana down the street. True, the decor at Hacienda is super cool, with its giant illuminated signs reading BAR and LIQUOR, and its collection of pulley hook things at the front entrance.

But the tables are crammed together wayyy too tight. We sat elbow to elbow with couples on either side of us, and it was nearly impossible not to eavesdrop anytime we paused to take a bite. Awkward seating arrangement, for sure. (There were plenty of open tables in the restaurant....why did they have to seat people on either side of us, literally inches away?) Also, I found it too brightly lit in there, which further detracted from the ambiance.

But really, it was the food that left me most disappointed. We ordered a trio of grilled fish tacos, which we've always thoroughly enjoyed at Playa Cabana. At Hacienda--not so much. They just weren't good at all.

The sangria, so skilfully concocted at Playa Cabana, also fell short here.

The saving grace was the beef shortrib taco, which thankfully has the same magic formula we fell in love with at Playa Cabana. If you do come to Hacienda, order the shortrib taco or miss out on a divine mess of savoury, crunchy goodness."}
{"text":"This is all I seem to get from the reviews about both playa cabana and hacienda: vibe and decor. Well I happen to prefer food above all else if it's a restaurant and this place really disappoints. Tacos are just loaded with \"fixins\" and therefore just have no character or taste. I am sure garnish and toppings are important but it can also be a neat way to grossly overcharge someone. Maybe learn from Grand Electric. $3.50 a taco but pretty damn good tacos for Toronto. You can actually taste the meat and not feel like you ate a taco stuffed with coleslaw and radish!"}
{"text":"Arrived here  Friday night January 26, 2018. I parking on the street free it was later in the evening. The outside looked sketchy and inside was small a little to intimate. 
The drinks are really expensive$$$$
The tacos are fabulous!!!! You must try the beef and fish tacos!!!! 
The chips salsa and guacamole are also expensive but very tasty and freshly prepared delivered to your table fast."}
{"text":"Nowhere near as good as the original PC, but twice as expensive. I wish they just offered the original menu/price at this location. Disappointing."}
{"text":"This review is based on my most recent experience here which was on cinco de mayo. 

The service was really good and quick. Everything I  ordered was on point and better then usual considering how busy they were. I was honestly impressed with the quality & quantity. Food was amazing and i could say without a doubt the fish tacos were soooo delicious! I ordered the battered shrimp with sesame for the first time and im glad i did! I loved the flavor, the texture, and it had a specific sauce drizzled on top that was exploding with flavor. 

I ordered a bulldog baby (margarita with a coronita) and the presentation was really cute and i enjoyed every bit of it! 

The churros with melted caramel and marshmallows was literalllly melt in your mouth good. It was heavenly and im a sucker for churros. 

I have zero complaints and I loved everything from beginning to end. They really hit a home run!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Mexican food I've eaten! This place is literally like 5 floors high and each floor is uniquely designed! The corn was LIT and the soft shell chicken tacos were FAB. Each bite was filed with so much flavour that I wish I ordered more! The service was on point but the food was pricey!"}
{"text":"I love this place for it's decor and margaritas.  The patio on a warm night is my favourite spot to be, with it's white lights and grill, and tacos that remind me of the street food in Mexico; the interior is very eclectic and has great atmosphere.  Always friendly and helpful staff.  Quick service.  Heaps of tequila based drinks, but the margaritas on the rocks are the best.  I've had the ceviche, guac, tacos, enchiladas and burritos.  As mentioned above, the food here, reminds me of the street food in Mexico and that, in my opinion, is a good thing.  The guac is delish and the numerous types of tacos are my favourite.  Food comes from the kitchen as it's ready so I like to order several types of tacos to share with whomever I'm dining with, and to nosh on guac and chips in between servings.  I didn't rate this place a five because the food doesn't knock me off my chair, but it's definitely good and I've never been disappointed.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Nice staff and interior but thats only thing good about this place. Food is terrible... definitely not genuine maxican and totally overpriced. Would never come back. 

Music was bad too they played bad classic rock like eye of the tiger"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us as being great.  The only thing great was the interesting apparently costly \"concept\" interior design and maybe the service.  The menu is small, that's ok, but 90-95% of it is all fried, so don't come here if you don't want grease.  The concept design is that it has old rusty neon and ball lighted signs that appear to been salvaged from old Arizona.  The chairs are 1960's heavy wooden and steel school chairs (hard to move) without the attached old fashioned desk top.  I think I even saw a couple on 1970's grey steel folding chairs.  Our old table looked like it had the green lead paint scraped off it.  Since we arrived on a Sat at 4:00pm, and being practically the only couple there, our service was good.  The grilled fish tacos say they are grilled, but they are pan fried in a flat pan.  There were no \"grill marks\"  or char grilled flavor on the fish.  The guacamole was very good but for the pittance of the amount they give you for $9 is rude.  The chips are refried and served wet of oil.  The deep fried Camarones are more batter than shrimp and they even included the burned left over batter crispies from the oil basket. The tres leches cake was over cooked, dry, too high and so dense that it could not absorb any leches. Homemade Terrible!  Margaritas we had were made with only lime juice and no mixer, nor simple sugar which is good!  We had four each and were charged $156 pre-tax!!!   Also, $12 for 2 tacos???!!  If you are familiar with Mexican, you know Mercadito NYC offers 4 tacos for $14.50 and they are gourmet compared to this.  The owner of this place who also owns 3 other similar TO locations must be raking in the money!!  We will never go back."}
{"text":"Liked the small cozy restaurant with good service. However I wasn't a big fan of their vegetarian soya tacos. My friend got chicken burrito and said it was decent. Felt it was too pricey for an average quality food."}
{"text":"This place is something special both to look at and to eat at. Explore each floor for its unique rusty gold art. Staff are great but a little slow on checking back with the table. The food is authentic bang on freshness. I had the jerk lobster burrito and it was a solid pick from the very difficult to pick from menu. What I mean is the menu is full of amazing tacos, burritos etc. The lobster was claw thick and fresh with jerk love. In house homemade habanero hot sauce. Missed it but next time for sure. I don't give to many hot spots 5 stars but this place was off the hook !! Specialty drinks shaken not stirred and frosty cold bottles of dos Equis and Coronas. Date night group night whatever night. Check this place out asap. It's fun and dam good grub."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while walking to another restaurant. The atmosphere is awesome. Wait staff was excellent. I had the jerk lobster taco, the octopus taco and the l.a truck taco. My fav was the jerk lobster and l.a truck tacos. The octopus was way to spicy for me. Drinks were great. Guacamole was great.  My spouse had the beef enchiladas- fricken amazing .   Would return to try different tacos. Would love to see this place at taco festival next year :)"}
{"text":"Organized a bachelor party dinner here. They were very accommodating with the changing numbers of guests. 
Ten gentlemen meant we ordered prix fixe. This made life easier.
More than enough appetizers: freshly fried nachos, ceviche, salad, and popcorn shrimp (not authentic, too good to care). 
Mains were tacos family style...
One each of soy chorizo (didn't taste meatless), LA truck Korean style beef, blackened fish, and short rib. 
All well sized and tasty. 
Dessert was tres leches cake & churros. Big hits around. 
Service was attentive and fun. 
Place was hot but we had a table by the window. 
Reasonably priced. 
Can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Our second visit to the playa cabana empire. We had a reservation at 5:30 but showed up late. The lower space was not too busy at the time and we were not quite sure why it took the front desk so much time (we waited for 10 minutes or so) to get us seated. When we arrived at the upper level, the place was buzzing. It is tiny and scrappy (just like the parent property) but it works for the environment they are trying to create. We were seated in the outdoor patio on a freezing wintry night. Thankfully, the heating was on full blast so we could survive. I am sure the patio is a great place to hang out with friends in the summer. Our server appeared a bit confused with what we ordered. We were presented with fresh guacamole when we did not order one. Upon clarification, they took it back. Beware - They will try to sell you hard on it but make sure you clarify whether or not you need it. We ordered a bunch of tacos (again we got one we did not order but we took it nevertheless) and the halibut tinga burrito. The tacos were nothing out of the ordinary but I preferred the crunchy ones. We were blown away with the flavors at the original location but this one did not seem to leave a lasting impression. I was quite satisfied with the burrito though. The fried onions on top were a nice addition. We finished our meal with an order of churros poutine. The churros themselves had a heavy coating of sugar (we had to dust off some of the excess sugar) but the marshmallow/peanut syrup to dip into was heavenly. It also took a long time to get our bill since our server got busy with other tables.  The menu is slightly different but more interesting at the original Playa."}
{"text":"I've visited two of this restaurant's locations (the original and the Hacienda). The service is always excellent, and the decor is nice. Its a great place for crowds of all ages - I've visited with friends and family (including my 85 year old grandparents). 

We always order their guacamole and chips. The chips are made to order and arrive warm and incredibly crisp. The guacamole is fresh and the flavours are well-balanced.

I've tried a few of their tacos, but I keep coming back to the ancho-braised shortrib. Its decadent without being heavy, and the crunchy cabbage slaw makes the dish. I love how they serve their tacos on lettuce leaves. 

My boyfriend swears by their original burrito. Its served with an amazing roja sauce, guac, crema, fresh chillies and cilantro. 

Protip: some of the seats seem quite exposed to the elements. We visited once on a very cold day and had to keep our coats on the entire time. It was annoying, but we were willing to stick it out in exchange for delicious and authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"A girl's night out mid week.... what a treat to go to this restaurant.  Food is fresh, hot and delicious.  Staff are amazing, always coming by to check in if you need anythig.  Empty plates are removed fast.  Oh go back a step.....first thing you have to order is the white wine Sangria.  Does it have a bang, one glass and I was smiling.  The best I've tasted in a long time.  The tacos are small but delicious so I suggest you order three.  So much flavour.  We started off with fresh nachos and Guacamole again very dangerous, I couldn't stop eating.  The restaurant is small but has a lot of character, nice ambience and friendly.  Want to go back real soon."}
{"text":"My daughter suggested this restaurant on our way to catch the electric car.  Looked quaint & cute.  We ordered a couple of margaritas then another round while we placed our dinner order.  After watching the table next to us who arrived after us eat & finish their dinner & our food had not arrived we asked  the fellow serving us where our food was.  He's reply was the Kitchen lost the order..... which can happen but now we've sat there watched the table finish & leave next to us finished our drinks not  good.  So I suggested  to the server considering our dinner was so late could he replace our drinks so we could enjoy one with our food which he apologized & did provide the two drinks.  Never saw him again paid the bill left a tip & wondered how this might seem okay or that he may have felt intruded upon not us.  When things fall a part I think it's reasonable to check on the customer to ensure things went smoothly after that at the very least"}
{"text":"We've been to many of the restaurants in this 'chain'. All very good and this one is no different. Had a variety of tacos (beef, seared tuna) that were really tasty. Grilled corn was good but would skip given how out of season it is - wait for late summer. Salad was refreshing addition. 

Service was solid. Attentive but not over the top. A bit too cramped having to crawl between tables. 

Good drinks."}
{"text":"It is not it's other locations.  Menu has less selection as they don't want to compete with their other restaurant location a block away.

Went on a Tuesday night and as crowded as always.  I am a lover of the Junction location as you can sit at the bar and not be jostled all night.

Food is good as at all locations. . .ended up going to the one on the next block to get what I wanted on the menu.

Margaritas and red sangria are very good."}
{"text":"VIBE 
If you love design, then you are in for a treat! The moment you walk into Hacienda --the third outpost in the Playa Cabana empire--you are welcomed with really cool decor details like the hanging hooks at the entrance and the plethora of cool typographic signs from SMASH. 

Playa is tiny for now but there is an upstairs and a balcony patio that seats up to 20. Next year, there will be a patio for 84 on the main level in the back. 

I came early (before 6pm) and already all seats but the bar were taken. I was taken care of by the bartender who made sure my food came out quickly. 

This is definitely a bar vibe and different from the other Playa Cabana locations. It's more of eat/quick/chill out. A bartender comes in at night and this apparently is pick up central (hopefully without the downtown banker douchebags). 

I ATE/DRANK 
Dave's Margarita is the libation of choice and damn, it is a GOOD margarita! The mojitos looked just as delicious. 

I was incredibly impressed with the halibut tostada - light and flaky fish on a crunchy tostada does not disappoint! You'll just want more. It's reasonable at $8. 

The LA truck taco is kalbi beef with slaw. It's a little heavy on the slaw but doesn't take away from the tenderness of the beef. Another highly recommended taco ($6). 

I was not as impressed with the jerk lobster taco. It is difficult to eat and too spicy for my liking. It's also expensive at $12 (yes, I know, lobster costs more...). I'd get a second halibut tostada. 

After the three dishes, I was sufficiently full. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
This is the best out of the three locations, in my opinion (again, I came early). Food, vibe and service were spot-on! This is definitely my cabana to playa (whoa, snap!)"}
{"text":"The decor of the restaurant is trendy and the food was delicious, but service was terrible. Absolutely atrocious. There were at least 4 servers standing around at any given time. They took forever to come to us after being seated and then drinks took close to 15 minutes to be served (well, even longer when one of them was incorrect). Our server was just clueless and had no thought to check on us or bring us the bill when we asked. Our reservation was at 5:30 so it wasn't very busy at that time. I can't imagine what it would be like much later in the night."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place. We take people here all the time. They just changed the nachos from a wonderfully tasty chip to ones that are meh. For a Mexican place you would think they would stay with what works. Hopefully the other locations do not use these sub par chips. We will not be ordering out guac / salsa / and chips anymore. Why bother,"}
{"text":"The food is not good.  It's cold and kinda sour.  The place is crammed and poorly organized.  And the waiters are mostly all rude.  Who does the hiring??"}
{"text":"Why 1 star? The speed of service was absolutely horrible. It took 30 min to get our guac, over an hour and a half to get ONE of our mains, and then I received my food 20 min after my partner. He was completely finished by the time I received mine.

We have been to other Playa restaurants and have never had an issue with this, this experience was super unfortunate as our waiter was lovely and the food was good. The wait time was unacceptable and although the waiter was apologizing and checking in with the kitchen we were not offered any compensation what so ever. We will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience, service and food. I loved every dish which I had there paired with an amazing pitcher of margarita.
Highly recommend making a reservation as this place is always full."}
{"text":"Sat outside on the patio of Hacienda. The food was not good and overpriced for the quality. Service was not good either, waitress barely came by our table after we ordered. I 100% won't go back there. There are many other Mexican restaurant in Toronto where you can get better quality food and at the same price point."}
{"text":"This place has a pretty nice ambience. The back patio was rustic and bright; very spacious. Service was friendly but a bit slow; servers tend to mingle with one another and disappear for a while. However, they did come by with free tequila.

We wanted burritos but later found out that they only served it inside and not on the patio (it's still the same restaurant...). There would be only tacos and a few other items on the menu. They will ask you if you want chips and guac when you sit down - keep in mind that it is not complimentary and will set you back $9 (they ask before you get the menu and see the price), just like the other Playa Cabana location. But if you want chips and guac, go for it.

We had 3 sets of tacos: braised short ribs, chorizo verde and pulpo (grilled octopus). The first two were similar but I preferred the sauce of the braised short ribs more. I was surprised that the octopus was very tender (not tough or chewy).

As far as the tacos go, Seven Lives does it better but the ones here are still good. This place has a nicer ambience if you want to sit and lounge."}
{"text":"Restaurants aren't in the food business. They're in the people business. This restaurant doesn't understand that. 

Their service is just horrible. Their bar staff know very little about what's behind the bar, and their attitude towards their customers is disrespectful. 

I'd recommend you go to El Rey instead. You'll get better food, better drinks, and much much better treatment as a paying customer."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in the city. Adorable outdoor space for a tasty, funky and sophisticated brunch. Cozy up inside with a Mezcal Ceasar in the winter for a pleasant dining experience. Good any time of the day. Unreal music. Nutty good decor."}
{"text":"One of a few \"Playa Cabana\" restaurants in the city, and just down the street from it's smaller, sister store \"La Carnita\".

Playa Cabana certainly hit the spot when we were craving Mexican.... we sat on the back patio, which is fully enclosed (\"winterized\") and heated with heat lamps. We were more than comfortable and happy to be accommodated so easily at 7pm on a Friday night.

The food was delicious - we had tried several of the tacos, as well as the ceviche appetizer... delicious. We could not leave without trying their churro poutine, which surprised us in it's simplicity (we were expecting a bit of a gross concoction).

Our server was amazing, friendly, and extremely helpful with her recommendations.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"i thought the food was just OK, campechana was nice but a tad salty, short ribs were meh, hard shell was nice but meat was lackluster and missing some \" pow \". This was one of those places where the service level was a slight miss, drinks took far too long to come out (bartender was new perhaps), server had a bit too much of that \"toronto snob\" attitude. cocktail menu is OK, but not that adventurous and with so many tequilas at the bar i thought a better promoted tequila flight would be in order (sample 4-5 different brands).. This place pales in comparison to playa's Cocina Economica, where the service is absolutely fantastic and the food much more flavorful. 

nice location, this old house has been a restaurant for as long as ive remember it ant at the corner of dupont and avenue couldnt be much more accessible for those in mid/uptown and downtown"}
{"text":"Food is always pretty good. Both here and at their original location on Dupont. I haven't been to any of the others yet. 

The service happened to be really bad (slow, rude, unnatentive etc), but to be fair, I don't recall this ever being the case on other visits.

The decor is really cool. I won't try to describe it, but just know that it's cool.

Food highlights: the corn is always next level delicious, braised beef tacos, tres leches cake"}
{"text":"Drink salty palomas.

Nosh on a 1kg. bucket of spicy shrimp (activity food! You have to do all the messy peeling!).

Eat bottomless chips with salsa.

FORGET THAT WINTER IS COMING.

I continue to be bummed that the back garden patio is now closed due to noise complaints. Some cozy seating inside, and I don't mind sitting right on Dupont pretending - stubbornly - that it's still summer. 

Yelp note: wifi not available (which is nice, frankly: talk to your friends! Instagram your guacamole later!)."}
{"text":"The presentation and atmosphere is excellent. The period when this restaurant is open is short. Only in summer so catch while you can. I think once a summer is not a bad idea. The food is from southern regions of Mexico and is authentic to the region so don't expect canadian style food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food and the selection was outstanding. They come in 3's and its meant to share so if you are going be prepared to eat a lot of tacos and drink a lot of beverages!!

We've heard so many great reviews of this location and it was worth the wait and lived up to all the positive things we've heard. Great location, and great atmosphere!"}
