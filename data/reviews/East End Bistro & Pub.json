{"text":"Decent local dive bar, the bartender is kinda aloof. They have the TouchTunes which I like but sadly the play ur song next feature turned off. I couldn't bump the music and someone was stuck in a time wrap and didn't play a song that was made after 1966."}
{"text":"Walked in the bar, the bartender looked at me and walked away.  She didn't greet me or say hi how are doing, do you need anything. Stood there for about 5-10 minutes waiting for her to ask if I need a drink or a menu.  Mind you, about 3 people total were sitting at the bar. She stood around talking to a coworker while I was still waiting to be served.  Ended up having to walk up to the cook or whoever the bartender was talking to ask for what I needed. Unfortunately I didn't get her name but she made sure to make the experience uncomfortable and horrible. I will never want to walk inside there again."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to the East End. When I walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the updated decor, I especially liked the walls and the back patio. I would say they need to update and sand down the picnic tables. We tried their Spicy Garlic Wings, pork taco,and chicken taco. The food came out in a timely fashion considering there was one bartender & one cook! The pork taco was OK however it seemed as though the pork had a bbq flavor and should have accompanied a \"bun\" and not a taco. The chicken was juicy and was edible also, a pretty good deal and tasty for the price. I do not believe the cheese was \"real\" . The spicy garlic sauce was GOOD!!! Very spicy and tangy! The bartender was unsure of the menu and could not offer up and details on the food. I will say she made a mean Tully Peach tea shot!! I will give this place a try again soon as I would like to try their create a burger and steak dinner. Reasonable prices and friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'll try to keep this short. .. Came here with a fairly large group to watch the Brown's game. I hadn't been there since it was the Shamrock.  Not too crowded, we were mostly drinking, so having a group wasn't really a big deal. A couple of my friends decided they wanted food, someone ordered wings and I guess most of them were raw inside.  I'm pretty sure that's more than gross.   Anyway, the staff and crowd were friendly enough. .. beer was cheap and cold. . Both great things. Patio is still super awesome.  Now for the part that really impressed me.  I was stupid enough to leave my leather jacket on the back of a chair.  Came back 10 minutes later and it was gone.  No surprise there, I'm the one that left it... totally wasn't even mad about it.  I left a note on the off chance it would turn up, and guess what? The manager reviewed the tapes, figured out what happened to it, and got it back for me! She also called to apologize for our experience with the food and offered to make it up to us.  She didn't have to do any of that, she went completely above and beyond.  That is worth a second visit there in itself!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Stopped in here for a few quick drinks and was bummed we couldn't stay longer. $2 domestics and nice bartenders, as well as complimentary charging stations on the bar for your phone- such a nice surprise!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people, great atmosphere. All around just a great place. The bartender on Sunday  is awesome. They just got a new patio that everyone in Lakewood should check out. You gotta try the mozz sticks!"}
{"text":"quite possibly the very best chicken quesadillas i've ever had are from here...and dip them in the buffalo cheese dip for an amazing snack!  ill be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for townie dive bars and East End is one of my favorites. What's not to love about a poorly lit atmosphere with cold beer, especially when there is good food! East end has all the charm of a dive bar, with a pool table, Keno, arcade games and plenty of tv's. You can tell they wanted to attract the younger crowds by updating the place a bit. But I find that it's usually regulars around these parts. The service can be slow, but it's always friendly. The menu is a little more extensive than your typical bar and they have daily specials. They also have appetizers, salads, build your own burger, sandwiches, and pizza. I am a huge fan of their buffalo tater tots and the wings are pretty good too. Oh yeah, massive draft beers too."}
{"text":"Good go to if ok w casual atmosphere and food served hot. Service slow but friendly! Decent/ok pizza. Hot steak fries. Good wings! Throw an upgraded fresh pretzel bun or thick cut awesome bread- (must be fresh!) go a long ways w their already good burger AND black bean burger!"}
