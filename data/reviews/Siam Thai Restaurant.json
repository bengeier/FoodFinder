{"text":"Love this place! I go here at least once a week and have tried about six things on their menu. The food is always fresh and you get large portions. I would compare it positively to any other Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is very casual, nothing fancy. But staff are super nice and the food comes out very quickly. The 1 to 10 rating scale means something here. I get an eight, and it's always quite spicy. Great red curry, pad prik khing, and garlic pepper. You won't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Well, the food is good... unless they disregard your \"3\" and give you an \"8.\" I've been here about 8 times and have left disappointed half of the time. They don't tend to overspice the curries, but all of the other dishes are frequently overspiced. 

The pad kee mow is delicious, but order \"no spicy.\""}
{"text":"This place is my total new favorite! The service was fast. Dining room clean and simple, but not fancy (just what I like for in between class nosh), and the food was excellent! Be warned, though,  I think their food is just a little spicer than what's usually in the burgh, so dial down the first time you're in.  But it was so good!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best drunken noodles in Pittsburgh. When they do the Rangoon for the starter and not the soup, it is my favorite lunch downtown. Their pad Thai is great also. Definitely not a fine dining spot but the food is great."}
{"text":"Walked in and was not greeted. Sat for 15 minutes unacknowledged. Left without a word said to me."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but the spring roll and drunken noodles were excellent.  They have hot oil and thai hot pepper flakes on the table to add yourself and the oil is delicious.  Prices are cheap, and the menu is filled with your standard Thai options.  I plan on working my way thru the menu"}
{"text":"The only thing I have tried here is the Thai Fried Rice. It is delicious. In my opinion this fried rice is better than that of the other Thai spot downtown, Nicky's."}
{"text":"True hole in the wall establishment with authentic Thai flavors.  They know how to add spiciness to the cashew chicken which is very flavorful.  Very quick with lunch orders to go, pretty much ready in 10-15 minutes at peak time for a single order."}
{"text":"Very unassuming spot with great food! I had driven by, but never stopped in until today. Hmmm...good food. Nice atmosphere. Great for a quick business lunch. Big Plus:  Nice portions. We had no leftovers. It was a nice lunch size portion.

They start with a small little appetizer. The menu is small, but has a nice variety. The food came out very quickly. Definitely a place you could go with 1/2 hour. 

I had 3.5 spice on the green curry; trying to keep it light during work hours. It had quite the kick so be cautious around your spice scale when ordering. All-in-all, a nice lunch experience. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Siam was a sold 3.5. The first thing that I noticed was the frigidness of the dinning room.  It was uncomfortably chilly and the two space heaters that were running did nothing to heat the space up.  I ate my meal with my scarf on and would have worn my hat too but I thought it might look a little low brow. The service was friendly but a little too quick when it came to placing my order. I was given almost no time to review the menu. I had hardly had my coat off before the waitress was back asking me if I already knew what I wanted to eat.  This being my first visit and all I did not appreciate that much, but I am sure in future visits it would be a nice touch once I familiarize myself with the menu. 

I had the steamed pork dumplings and the Garlic pepper with mixed seafood. The dumplings were rubbery and under seasoned and  after eating them I wished I had never ordered them.  The garlic pepper sauce on my entree is what has me awarding 3 stars to Siam it was very flavorful.  But the mixed seafood looked like a horror show with three tiny sad looking shrimp and a cold scallop. For $10.50 I was fed a quarter cup of food and had to eat all of my rice to fill me up.  I am in no rush to get back Siam. And the server kept trying to hand my dishes to the man setting next to me.  The dining room was not busy at all for them to have gotten my order mixed up. It's cold and flu season I really don't want some stranger pawing my food unnecessarily."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch from here recently via GrubHub, and it was much better than the last place I tried. I got chicken Pad Thai and a coke, and it took less than half an hour for my food to arrive. The Pad Thai had a delicious reddish sauce that wasn't too sweet, and the chicken and vegetables were all up to par. The spice level actually had a kick to it as well, so keep that in mind when ordering. Given the very generous portion size (particularly for such a cheap lunch price) I know I'll be keeping Siam Thai Restaurant in mind for future GrubHub orders."}
{"text":"The chief's mood and the service is very unsteady I think. 
1) the spicy level- sometimes level 2 is two spicy, and sometimes level 6 is not spicy at all. But you can always play safe to order a low level of spiciness and ask for a side of pepper flakes 
2) the amount - sometimes they make a small portion, sometimes I feel like they put two orders into one plate, today's was super big! Which is good but I got too full. Haha
3) speed - it can be fast within 5 minutes or it can be quite a wait like 20,30minutes. Maybe you colleges or friends are finishing their meal while yours just got out of kitchen. 

So it really depends! But the taste is always good! Haven't been disappointed even once,  Pak kee mow is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Came across this place when leaving my dentist's office across the street.  Needed to grab take-out to bring back to work with me, so I decided to give them a try. Ordered Thai spring rolls and vegetable pad thai.  Waited about 20 minutes for my order. Everything was steaming hot, which was great. However: Though the spring rolls were nicely hot and crunchy, they had no flavor/seasoning other then a black pepper taste. They seemed to be primarily cabbage - I didn't see any other vegetables in them.   
The pad thai was not good. The noodles were overcooked, rubbery and dark - not fresh.  I have come across this issue with take-out from other thai restaurants. I wonder if, for take-out, some places have a bunch of pre-made items that they just reheat in the microwave? I don't know how else to explain these rubbery, shriveled noodles. Plus, the sauce had a strange taste - maybe like it was a beef-base? Very odd. And disappointing, especially considering the pretty positive \"Munch\" article they had framed on their wall that featured both items I had ordered.  Since I'm pregnant, I didn't eat more than a few bites of the pad thai because it just didn't taste right to me.  Not planning to go out of my way to go back there."}
{"text":"Great food, service and affordable prices. I've had Pad See Eww, Drunken Noodles and Fried rice. Never need disappointed. Service is fast so they are ideal for lunch. They are tucked away downtown so if you like to get off the beaten path its perfect. $8 minimum for credit cards but that's no problem."}
{"text":"Today I wanted something different for lunch, so I ordered take out from Siam. I ate lunch in a couple times but many years ago and always had good service (I ordered pineapple fried rice back then, delish) I know they closed and reopened so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I ordered pineapple curry with chicken, level 6. It was waiting for me after 20 minutes. I will say, the dining room was packed and very loud, I could barely hear the cashier tell me my total. My lunch was $9.10 plus tip and it is amazing! The crab Rangoon was a nice surprise and totally delicious, the curry is even better! I will definitely be back to try the fried rice again!"}
{"text":"Went here twice in the last few weeks and the food is very good. The first time I had the pineapple curry with chicken. The curry was slightly sweet with just the right amount of spicy heat. The second trip here I ordered basil chicken. It was tender juicy chicken with a nice brown sauce,green pepper, onion and fresh basil. Also very delicious!! 
Anytime I'm in downtown Pittsburgh I'll be stopping here to try more Thai food."}
{"text":"Great Thai food.  Some of the best in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is definitely run down and the bathrooms aren't a heated but the food is great!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I was a little bit disappointed.  I ordered the Pad Thai and it was incredibly dry and sort of bland flavor-wise. On top of that, my mango juice tasted like onion which was pretty odd. Overall, you get a good amount of food for what you're paying, but the quality really isn't the best. Average dinner for me and my taste buds."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best lunch options downtown. Inexpensive, friendly staff, and the food is on par with (if not better than) Pittsburgh's more well-known Thai offerings."}
{"text":"They can never get a take out order correct. I called ahead of time on MANY occasions for food. The food wasn't cooking yet, or was not done.   I've had to wait a long time for my food  on MANY occasions. I always order in advance and they almost NEVER get it right. Don't waste your precious time to go here for lunch. You can't depend on them. They have Bad customer service as you can see, as well as overall CONSISTENCY issues with the service and the food. Read the other reviews with the same issuess. It's Not worth it. Avoid the headache. The quality of food versus service is not worth it at all whatsoever."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was delicious! Service was good, despite it being a very busy lunch rush.  I gave four stars because our spring rolls were cold on the inside and the Thai iced tea was sweeter than normal. Otherwise everything was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"I've been there several times for lunch and it is almost always good; however, I ordered takeout for dinner since I was downtown and my drunken noodles aka pad kee mao was tasteless. Kee mao is supposed to be a little bit spicy even if you order a lower level spice but this was almost inedible. Also, they did not give us any utensils or napkins for takeout or even offer them. We were staying at a hotel downtown so they were actually necessary. I'm leaving it at 3 stars since it's usually good at lunch but definitely a disappointing dinner experience. I'll stick to my usual thai places for dinner: Smiling Banana Leaf, Thai Cuisine, and NoodleHead from now on!"}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a second chance ..... the food was good but the service was awful The server was extremely rude even while the owner was there ...I will never go back,Nicky'sThai Kitchen will be my choice"}
{"text":"Looking for a solid lunch place to go in the city? Maybe you are in the mood for Thai food? Whatever the case may be, Siam Thai restaurant is a tasty, affordable choice. Recently, working in this part of downtown on Blvd of Allies, there a ton of lunch spots to choose from. It's my goal to get more familiar with this side of town and find all the hidden gems that there may be. I can largely thank my coworkers for that because no one ever packs lunches any more. Besides me of course. 

First time walking in and it's a small place. The dining room is tiny and the tables are pretty close to one another. Being that it was 12pm noon and lunch time, there wasn't an empty seat in the place. But that is when the quick service takes over. I went with a party of 8 including myself and are orders were placed and food was brought out to us in about 20 minutes. 

Besides the quick service, the food was delicious! I got the Cashew Nut chicken with white rice. I'm a baby when it comes to spicy, so I got a 0. I know, no need to rub it in. But my dish was perfect and I really enjoyed the crunch of the cashews. All for $9 and you can't beat that for lunch! A cute little touch was my rice being shaped into a heart! I feel the love Siam Thai, I feel the love!"}
{"text":"Lunch service was fast and accurate.  I asked for an 8 spice level and that's exactly what I got,  which is refreshing.  Rive was a tad overcooked but the cashew tofu was perfect.  The vegetables weren't overcooked and they did not skimp!  Will be back weekly at this point."}
{"text":"Travel by PIT heard so much abt this thai restaurant, when I get there so disappointed. WHY? Because they are not open. Yap show is open , Google show is not until 4pm, fine I can wait.. When I get there see the new business hr , n guess what, after standing on the street waiting n call the phone.. NO ONE answer or no sign of life form! If u can not honor this basic principles, how good ur food can that be ? Can u even keep ur standard?"}
{"text":"Good food.  Pad Thai was spot on.  Don't know why they serve a single, cold crab Rangoon with lunch.  Gross.  Service was horrible.  They ignored me when I walked in for pick up, and worse...  My biggest pet peeve..   for a total of $10.13, I paid $11 and she asked if I wanted change.  For takeout!!!  

Maybe it's a cultural difference, but I won't be back.  Stick to Angkor in Greentree."}
{"text":"This place is very good and cheap. Today I got the spicy tail rice as a #7 and wow was that hot. 

Food is reasonable at 8.50 and water is free. The people are very nice and welcoming. Normally it gets packed and has a small area for eating. Arrive early or after 1 and it will die down a little."}
{"text":"Good place to eat, hole in the wall but always busy. I've eaten here a dozen times or so with friends and my wife, who both liked the food. Consistency is spotty. You either get a home run great food or an oh well maybe next time meal. If in the downtown area is worth a visit."}
{"text":"While in the mood for something other than an elephant scab on a bun for lunch today, I walked into Siam Thai to see what they were like. The place was nearly empty when I walked in with the exception of one couple already seated. Granted, we had a ton of snow dumped on us this morning so I didn't take the lack of business as a sign that there was anything wrong with the place. I was greeted cheerfully when I walked in and was seated immediately. Within a minute I had a menu, a glass of water and a single ragoon on a plate with sauce.

Looking over the menu I decided on the Stir Fried Broccoli.  With each meal you get your choice of chicken, pork, tofu, beef, duck or shrimp. I originally was going to go with the duck but since they were out of that on this particular day I went with the beef.  I was also asked to what degree of spiciness I would like and I went with an 8 on a 1 to 10 scale. 

The meal was in front of me within five minutes. The rice came molded into a heart-shape which I thought was a nice touch. The broccoli and carrots were good and crunchy (not soft and overcooked), the brown sauce had a very good kick to it but sadly the meat was awful! It was all tough and gristly making me wish that they had the duck available or that I would have chosen chicken instead.   

My bill came to a little over $10. The service was fast and friendly, the atmosphere was comfortable and this place has a lot going for it... but it's not even close to being the quality of Nicky's Thai Kitchen on Penn. I give it a 3 star mainly due to the meat."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. We ordered tofu pad Thai & chicken pad Thai via Grubhub app, these are not complex dishes to prepare & are standard on Thai restaurant menus. The food took over 1 hour to arrive to our hotel which is approximately 2 miles away from the restaurant. When the driver arrived at our hotel he called us via cellphone & asked us to come outside in the rain to get it from him. After some coaxing he agreed to bring it to our room. When the food arrived, it was cold, bland, & unseasoned. Very disappointing for the price & time wait. We will not be ordering from this restaurant again, & nor should you."}
{"text":"I stopped here after the restaurant I wanted to go to mysteriously closed. Their food is very yummy. The staff is pleasant and I will definitely be back. I looked into my bag and smiled that I got a free treat added into my bag. I never knew this place was there and it's definitely a gem."}
{"text":"Quick service and welcoming. I had the spicy Thai rice with chicken. Really good. Apparently my review can be 2 sentences long so I had to right this sentence as well."}
{"text":"I had the pad thai, usually my favorite thai dish, also tried the red curry. Pad thai was Ok, noodles seemed a little soggy, barely any vegetables in the dish. The dining area seem bleak. Service was average friendly. Not something I would race over town to eat. If it's the only thing around - ok."}
