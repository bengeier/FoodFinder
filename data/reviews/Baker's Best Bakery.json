{"text":"This place has remained the best Filipino bakery in my neighborhood. Never once have they changed their recipes (at least not to my knowledge - they still taste the same!), so you can rely on them to bake the same delicious pandisal as they baked 10 years ago!"}
{"text":"Can I just mention how redundant the name of this place is.. \"Baker's Best Bakery\".... LOL.   You want fresh PAN-DE-SAL? The awesome bread rolls us Filipinos have for breakfast or sometimes for our merienda (small snack)... Girl this is where you get them!  They also sell awesome BAO Buns.. or SIOPAO, filled with awesome meat fillings! They don't skimp on it, no no no."}
{"text":"When you walk in you can smell the delicious aroma of baking. Absolutely delicious pandesal! My relatives that don't live in the area always come to pick some up when they are nearby.   Ever since I was a little kid I was hooked onto the kusinta and puto snacks. I would always ask my parents to  grab one (or both!) after a dentist appointment next door.   The shop is pretty small and the bread can sometimes be sold out if you come in too late. It's a great grab-and-go Filipino bakery!"}
{"text":"PROPER Filipino bakery. Nowhere to sit but they got the right goods. Consider this a great place to grab baked goods to take home."}
{"text":"This is my favourite bakery. I grew up eating pandesal, mamon and ensaymada from Baker's Best. I've never had Filipino baked goods comparable to theirs. This weekend, I visited Baker's Best for the first time in nearly 15 years. I ordered the freshly-baked pandesal. It was fluffy, soft and warm - just as I remembered."}
{"text":"Hands down this place has the best HOT pandesal and siopao!! The moment I experienced their mouth watering hot pandesal aroma and chicken siopao, I never go anywhere but here even if it takes me 45 minutes driving. Also try the custard cake and cassava cake. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was craving for some fresh baked pandesal so I tagged along with some friends to this Filipino bakery. Boy am I glad I went! As soon as you walk in you're greeting with the tantalizing aroma of fresh baked bread, I was in heaven.   The store is small and cramped. The aisles are just wide enough for two lines of people to squeeze past each other (one coming and one going). There's a large variety of baked goods to choose from. There are cooling racks behind the display case with all the fresh out of the oven baked goods. There are also 2 large shelves with Filipino grocery items (they carry my favorite noodles - Lucky Me Chilimansi flavor) and a refrigerated section which has my favorite green tea (C2 which is sweetened with cane sugar).   The line was long but it moved quickly. We ordered 2 dozen regular pandesal and 1 dozen wheat pandesal which came out to be a little under $10. I love that everything was labeled with the name of the item and the price. The store is efficient and well organized.  These rolls are not the typical ones you find in the Philippines which are small and hard. These are similar to the ones you find in Southern California - large and soft with a touch of sweetness. There are a number of ways to enjoy it - dunk it in coffee or hot chocolate, toast it with some butter, use any kind of spread you have (nutella is always good), make sliders out of it, or use it to make an ice cream sandwich. The best way to see if it is really good though is to eat it hot, right out of the oven. Definitely coming back to try their other offerings."}
{"text":"So glad I came across this bakery! This bakery has good hours, and before closing time, they still had many bakery items to choose from. I just had to try one of their specialties.  I bought macarons for $2.50 (comes with 8 pieces). Tasted really good, perfectly sweetened!  I'll make sure to drop by again to try more of their goods. They had many mamon's still available when I went (ube, mocha, and vanilla assortments), and would definitely try that next time.  Review 82 of 100"}
{"text":"Love the leche flan from here! It's only $8 but it sells out fast so get here early or you'll be disappointed. Fresh breads, cakes, cookies and specialty imported products available. Ube ice cream too! Saw a custard cake for $10, definitely trying that next time!"}
{"text":"Its a really small filipino bakery that I have been going here since I was a little kid. My Mom used to visit sometimes after she picked me up from school and occasionally, she still stops by. They have pretty good pandesal, especially if you can get it hot and fresh. Some of my other favourite things are their Turon which is available on Saturdays and their Ube bread.   There are also lots of traditional filipino foods available. They have longanisa, puto, leche flan and more!   If you want some good filipino baked goods and don't know what to try, I would say go for the Ube bread or try Turon on a Saturday."}
