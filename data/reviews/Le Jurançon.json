{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious! We were a big group and they accommodated us well. Everyone was impressed with their meals and wanted to return in the future. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was how heavy the food was. Although, with duck bring in most, if not all, dishes, what else would you expect?"}
{"text":"Excellente cuisine et une atmosphère conviviale .... atmosphère, atmosphère ? Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère ?"}
{"text":"Un petit coin de paradis français, pour commencer le décor est très traditionnel et chaleureux, très réconfortant avec seulement 24 places assises on se sent très intime. Le personel est très aimable et acceuillant. Ensuite pour le menu, très simple mais de bon classic français. La carte des vins et petite mais que des bons vins! La nourriture etait simplement extraordinaire bien gouteuse pour ma part j'ai prit la bouillabaisse, une sorte de soupe au fruit de mer incroyablement délicieuse. Mon copain lui a prit le cassoulet repas très copieux et réconfortant. Nous avons prit l'assiette dècouverte en entrée qui était composé d'un foie gras maison a en tomber par terre, un magret de canard séché absoluement délicieux, un peu de rilliette fraiche et un tartare de saumon bien equilibré et rafraichissant! En dessert nous sommes allez avec le duo de crème brulé qui n'a que merveilleusement bien complété ce somptueux repas. Je vous le recommande à tous surtout en couple c'est parfait pour un repas au chandelle..."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant avec une cuisine du sud ouest de la France belle carte de vins il font aussi des brunch mais il faut réserver la salle est petite. Le propriétaire est très sympathique ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent little neighborhood French restaurant with an unpretentious decor. 

Our group was warmly welcomed by the waiter who offered to take our coats.  Throughout the evening his service was warm, friendly and timely.

The menu is typical of Southern French cuisine with cassoulets, duck and boudin noir (blood pudding).  

We were a large group and sampled most of what the restaurant had to offer.  Everyone either raved  about or were very satisfied with their choice.

I tried the gravlax entrée and the cheese ravioli, which comes with a duck and asparagus rosé sauce.  Both were very good.  The portion for the gravlax entrée, served on a bed of shredded beets,  was almost that of a main course.  Hence when the large plate of raviolis came, I was only able to eat half of it.

All the meats (steak, lamb shank, veal) were perfectly cooked, the fish of the day was fresh, delicious and served with a mound of ratatouille.  Again, all the portions were very generous.  Hence only one person (ok, me) had a desert. I had my eye on the crème brûlée/chocolate mousse duo from the getgo.
It was ok but nothing special.

The wine selection was surprising in both quality and quantity given the size of the restaurant.

Prices range from 20$ to 28$ for the table d'hôte which includes a few choices of entrées.

It was obvious there was a chef in the kitchen and that he or she ensured the ingredients were of good quality and fresh.

Definitely a place I would go back to and that I would recommend to friends.

They also have a lunch menu that is extensive and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance of this place. I don't see very many \"authentic\" feeling restaurants in Montreal. This restaurant feels like the living room of a family home - in a very good way. It was probably the highlight of the experience.

The food was also pretty solid. We ordered the cassoulet and duck breast. We thought he duck breast was a bit bland, but the cassoulet was very good and tasty. Wine selection (by the glass) wasn't great and my wine was okay.

Definitely worth going if you're in the mood for some French cuisine. It's a very nice find :) nestled quite nicely in a cute neighborhood."}
{"text":"We love this place. The owner and waiter is very nice and always funny. 

They serve a south of France cuisine. The cassoulet is memorable. So is the duck, the lamb, the tuna or the salmon (depending of the poisson du jour). The menu changes every season. For example the cassoulet is available only during the winter. You wouldn't want to eat such a heavy meal in summer anyway ;)

The wine selection is small but they have good choices. Of course there is the Jurançon white wine.

For lunch they have some incredible food for less than 10$. Saucisse Toulouse, duck salad, bavette and fries, etc.

It's a small place so atmosphere is quiet, yet very relaxed.

A little expensive for dinner. Expect to pay over 100$ for a meal for two with a wine bottle.

As good as it gets in Petite-Patrie!"}
{"text":"Chose the restaurant based on convenience to my airbnb in Mtl, positive other reviews here and a lovely reception they gave me when I walked in to check it out a couple hours ahead of dinnertime.  As others have said, the server (owner?) is friendly & helpful & the place is small, cute & NOT TOO NOISY!!! (hooray). Entrees-root veg puree soup and a shredded beet salad were only OK (I felt like I was \"working\" thru the salad, didn't finish it.). Mains: duck prepared in a fruity sauce was actually quite light & was delicious. The Lamb shank & braised beef were tender, rich & hearty dishes. The south-western France, grandmother's kitchen is a distinctive style of cooking (pretty heavy, not a \"steamed veggies\" kind of cuisine). I would have liked a bit more attention in our service, I was left waiting for a wine refill for too long - I'd finished my dinner and we were too tired to hang around for dessert."}
{"text":"Fantastic, this place is excellent. The owner/manager/waiter is very friendly and welcoming and helped us with the French menu. We ordered the Cassoulet, the tagliatelle, and the braised beef, all were 5 star. (Starters were onion soups, and escargots, also good). Nice wine selection with fair prices. 

The place is small, and the ambience is excellent. For out of town / non French visitors be prepared for hearty and rich portions - we had to take half of our entrees home. 

Prices are good - get the full menu for an additional $8 and get a premium appetizer plus desert included with entree cost."}
{"text":"La terrine de foie gras et le jarret d'agneau étaient excellents. Le service a été génial, c'est le propriétaire qui vous rend service, il est super sympa, et peut meuner une conversation très intéressante. Le resto à l'intérieur et son décor était très sympa. Je vais retourner sûrement. J'ai attaché une photo du jarret d'agneau."}
{"text":"Si vous aimez la bonne bouffe française du sud ouest allez-y! Bonne ambiance amicale, de bonnes portions bien  généreuses. J'ai particulièrement aimé le cassoulet traditionnel. N'y allez pas si vous êtes au régime; )"}
{"text":"Excellent service, les plats étaient délicieux et bien proportionés. Le proprio est ultra sympathique. Bref, super resto de quartier!"}
{"text":"My amazing husband found this restaurant when he was looking for a French place in the area of the Montreal apartment we always rent when on vacation.  However, if you are staying somewhere else, it is definitely worth a trip to this cute neighborhood and great restaurant.

The restaurant is intimate (I counted 13 2-tops total), with one bright yellow and blue room, and vine-y plants hanging in the windows.  Get the full menu... for only an additional $8, you can have a choice of entree (meaning appetizer) and dessert added to the main course of your choice's price.  My favorite was my daughter's duck done two ways.  My son also had an amazing ravioli with duck confit.  I started with the snails (perfect texture, neither chewy nor mushy) and had the mixed grill, which was also delicious and perfectly cooked.  My husband had a salad with gizzards, which doesn't sound like something you want, but believe me, it really is.  Desserts were also impressive.  The wine list, not available on the website, is on a chalkboard in the restaurant.  Most bottles are in the $35-55 range, with many glasses available from $7.5-9.

There was one cheerful waiter (he's actually from France) serving the whole place and making it look easy and fun.  And I think the chef/owner cooks everything himself.  We got to meet him at the end of the meal because a big table of 8 people requested him to come out while everyone was finishing desserts.

I will definitely return, and this restaurant will replace L'express for us...it is also an excellent restaurant I have reviewed here, but Jurancon is much more charming, and the food is more adventurous."}
{"text":"Super ! 
Si tu adores la cuisine du sud ouest de la France il faut absolument que tu viennes au Jurancon !
Fred le patron est super sympa, il te servira avec l'accent authentique de ce magnifique coin de France, il saura te mettre à l'aise dès le début.

La carte est vraiment typique du sud ouest : foie gras, cassoulet, salade perigourdine, confit de canard, ... beaucoup de plat à base de canard !
Le cassoulet que j'ai pris était délicieux, cuit comme il faut et avec des ingrédients extra. Très bien servis en plus ! Vraiment un cassoulet maison, un des meilleurs que j'ai mangé dans un restaurant, on se croirait vraiment dans le sud ouest avec cela dans le plat :)
La carte des vins est très bonne, il y a beaucoup d'importations privés de bonnes factures. Le patron est connaisseur et cela se ressent sur sa sélection. Les prix sont vraiment acceptables pour des bons vins.

Au niveau service nous avons fêté les 50 ans d'une personne et nous étions une quinzaine, le service a été parfait, pas de fausses notes et aucun retard dans les plats, chapeau !

Le restaurant est assez petit donc il vaut mieux réserver avant de venir pour être sur d'avoir une place.

Vraiment satisfait de cette découverte, je saurais où trouver refuge pour manger du canard de qualité lors d'une prochaine envie ! je vous le recommande :)"}
