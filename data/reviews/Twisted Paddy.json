{"text":"Went in tonight with a buddy of mine for a few drinks. Food was good and price was even better. The bartender John seemed like a cool dude who had some great suggestions, I admit that I can be a picky eater but he had some nice suggestions like those egg rolls and tacos! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A delightful and refreshing twist on the burger.  I got the Tommy K (delicious) and Gouda Mac and cheese balls(also delicious).  I can't wait to go back and try something else because everything on the menu sounded delicious!  Sooooo happy to finally get a good restaurant in this location!"}
{"text":"Nice outdoor patio. Excellent beer selection. Great service. Cool gourmet burgers on menu. All around great place."}
{"text":"Love the build you own burger menu. It's become a regular place for my fiends and I, highly recommend. 5 stars *****"}
{"text":"Food is good! Build your own sandwich never disappoints as well as the taquitos. The servers are so so. We've had good and we've had \"meh\". Husband likes the beer selection. Inside has always been clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Liked those burgers . And those Hush Puppies  are pretty good too. For me the Guinness was the best."}
{"text":"Good service. Interesting menu choices. Nice beer selection. Just what this area needed."}
{"text":"The food is crazy good. They have awesome specials. They've really made this place nice inside since last owners."}
{"text":"Parking is horrible, one of the neighbor homeowners decided that it was his job to give everyone a piece of his mind. Food was okay but service was slow and uncaring. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it opened - service, food, everything.  The last 2 visits had dismal customer service...what happened?  The first time we finally got a drink and she said she would be right back for our order.  We then saw her go have a cigarette -REALLY - we did not get any service for the next 15 minutes while she smoked. 2 weeks later we had nice enough weather to eat outside - 3 tables already served.  We waited about 10 minutes and finally went in to look for someone.  Again took our drink order about 15 minutes later she came back and said the bar was very busy (it was not by the way) and said she would come back for the dinner order.  Yep waited another 15 minutes....if they were busy I would be ok - but it wasn't.  Had it not been so late by then (on a week night mind you) I would have left and gone somewhere else.  SAVE YOURSELF Twisted Paddy - get some good servers.....you are a nice place to go!!!!  If my next service is this bad I wont be back and I was there at least 2 - 3 times a month."}
{"text":"Service is great, fast and friendly! The food was amazing the first two times I went there was raving about it to everyone. Then there was the third and unfortunately the final time, the service was great as usual but the food had changed. Hush puppy's were so boring they used to have bacon and jalape√±o in them, that time just straight corn bread batter fried. Everyone in the group ordered burgers mid-rare and that were well done and beyond. I ordered the battered and fried breakfast burger that was fried and then for some reason then put back on the flat top and was turned into charcoal. Worst experience ever. The server was very apologetic which was great but service is only half of the puzzle.  Bring back the amazing food I had before!!!"}
{"text":"So this was my time here and it's you typical bar/restraunt. I ordered the chicken waffle appetizers and they were great and cooked tender. Then came the waffle dipped burger with bacon the bacon was freaking awsome that make the burger the perfect sweet salty combo now the bad I know I know but the fries was a little.peppery for my taste but they were cooked well and the service was outstanding this place is a must go"}
{"text":"Tried this place because it's close and I had never been. Burgers and fries were great. Also the bartender makes some really good mixed drinks. I will be back for sure...."}
{"text":"Very Good burgers.  Nice selection of toppings and varieties.  We had the fried Mac Bites which were nicely fried, but not overly heavy or greasy.   Good beer and whiskey selection.  I would give this place 5 stars except for the fact that one of the workers there put his nasty tennis shoes on the bar, and then put them on.. Gross."}
{"text":"The only thing I could possibly find room to complain about and I mean the only thing is the fire hydrant right in the middle of the driveway. I mean, this thing is right in the middle of a driveway. Not that the business has anything to do with where the city places fire hydrants, but the holes around the fire hydrant indicate that it's place when was poorly chosen by the city. Looks like people of whacked the hell out of this thing. So while my son was down at lost nation Sports Park I came up here to get something to eat and have a couple of beers. It's pretty neat because of the simplicity of the menu. It's pretty much burgers. Getting on a bun you know in a lettuce wrap or in a bowl.

Pricing is also simplified, ten bucks. So no matter how much you load your burger up, with or without fried onions pickles fried eggs it doesn't matter it still 10 bucks.

I ordered Guinness and the bartender poured the beer correctly. Seemed like he knew what he was doing. Overall the place is very clean, well it, everything worked and they had massive televisions. Definitely going again."}
{"text":"My wife and I walked into the patio and received stares from the rest of the customers. It felt weird initially but we're not from the area so maybe we were dressed funny, or my wife was smoking hot that day, I couldn't say for sure. The place is tucked away on lakeshore Ave and the view from the patio included the road itself but also beautiful trees on the opposite side of the street and great flowers surrounding the patio. Perhaps the other customers were just bored because there's no tv on the patio? My wife busied herself with her phone for the next ten minutes while we waited for our drinks and menus. The waitstaff was good looking and so I was looking for things they would do wrong. Places that hire cute staff sometimes suffer performance. The service was decent but we may have gotten to meet all of them. Brings new meaning to team effort. My wife and I both ordered a lettuce wrap burger which doesn't hold up well. So knife and fork were used. She got fries which were tasty and nicely seasoned. The Burger options are pink or no pink and they successfully hit their marks on both sides. I got hush puppies which defeated the purpose of a lettuce wrap but were tasty. Little bits of corn and onion and a decent sweet sauce for dippin. All in all I'm gonna go back again next time I'm in the area. Good food, people, and location."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab drinks and appetizers! Patio has a nice atmosphere and service is good--servers are attentive! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Really good food and staff was excellent each time i visited. Everyone was friendly. The build your own burger offers many variations."}
{"text":"Good food and prices and daily specials. You can certainly fill up on their $5.00 lunch menu. Owner Matt is very energetic fellow with many good ideas and promotions. They have a monthly pig roast."}
{"text":"Food is good. Service is lacking today. Need to hire one more server or bar tender. One lackluster server who needs good training.  Bar tender is smiling but also working tables.  Burgers were good and hot.  Parking lot is always busy.   Good close to home locale.   Hoping the service gets better so this place makes it.  Patio is nice but staff could not have handled it tonight."}
{"text":"very good quaint place. the food was all very good at a reasonable price. the place lacks parking though we had to park far down a street. They get very busy on the weekends so get there early if u want to sit outside especially if they have a band playing that night. as mentioned the food was very good the hush puppies were excellent and the Belgium Chicken was awsome must try both!! biggest reason I am not giving 5 stars was the service. don't get me wrong they were hopping but they lack when it comes to service and taking care of the people who ordered dinner. wait times are long to order and to get meal once ordered, so plan on having a few drinks before your food arrives. they also seem to run out of the popular beer and wine as we had to order something totally different, it wasn't a bad thing we had to try new beverages but if they have Corona on special at $2 you would think they have a huge supply of it... they didn't they said they sold out of Carona... next time the bar should order double the amount of Carona and get extra bottles of the popular wines!!! all in all we will be back for sure !!!!"}
{"text":"I was sadly disapointed in my experiance with this joint. I'm always hopeful when a local place tries to put a twist on Irish fare, but there's not alot of Irish going on, here. First of all, I wanted to get soup insead of fries with my burger--for an upcharge, of course, even though the price for both, a-la carte was the same. I was told, \"...absolutly not\", just like that. Good thing a family member was just ordering fries, so she ordered soup instead, and we traded. Then I asked for bacon, mushrooms, and swiss cheese, but was told, sorry, no swiss... OK, I'll take chedder and I'd like my \"Irish Ketchup\" on the side. Oh, what? Not allowed to have sauce on the side? Ummm, OK...  Totally effed up and weird at the same time, but, whatever. So, the burger came, and unfortunatly, cook messed up the order, so no bacon or chedder cheese. The ketchep was nothing like \"Irish Ketchup\", it was sort of gross tasting (I'm 1rst generation Irish-American). I called the server over to request they remake the burger I ordered and to ask about the ketchup that came with it. She said the Irish Ketchep was regular ketchep with malt vineger mixed in. I asked how that was Irish Ketchup and she said that's how they make it in Ireland. NO, they don't. When I asked if bread crumbs were mixed into the meat, she said, only a little bit, to keep the burger moist. I asked if they could make me an all meat burger, because my burger had so much breadcrumbs added, it tasted like meatloaf, and she said no, that they make all the burgers ahead of time. Then she left to get my burger remade. It took over a half hour before I got my burger, because she was the only waitress on a Saturday night. By the time it came, everybody at my table was already done. She brought the BarBQ sauce I opted for instead of their \"Irish Ketchup\", on the side to try and make me happier, I guess. It was a pittiful experiance for a $13 burger, and I probably won't be back if things don't change."}
{"text":"We were just there for a party and we had a great time. Good drink selection, friendly staff. Appetizer menu inventive, burgers good."}
{"text":"This was my favorite burger place, but they recently got sold and it has drastically changed. They no longer have the build your own burger menu, which is okay, but when I went with friends they didn't ask us how we wanted our burgers done and my friend's was very well done, The burgers look like they're just frozen patties now, and my friend ordered a pizza  that looks like it was just one of those Stouffer's type meals with a slice of cheese on top, and our waters had a metallic taste like it was from a hose. At the end of the night just before we left a large loud group of drunk people came over and several older women decided to get a picture of them flashing their breasts while sitting on a skeeball machine, while the staff was in the back."}
{"text":"Great choice of beers, very nice staff, food is amazing.  The build ur burger is awesome, cool toppings, hush puppies r huge and cole slaw is to die for.  Go there quite a bit and let everyone know how good it is."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Very clean! Don't care for the service. Better bars to visit close by. Burgers are great. But I'm confused why the Irish name."}
{"text":"I couldn't be MORE excited that the Twisted Paddy opened or that McPat owns it! The McCoyne family has done incredible things with bars..the Goose, CroPats and now the Paddy! Food is amazing, I've even made a few suggestions to McPat about adding a burger or 2. Craft beers amazing selection..suggested adding MORE Southern tier beer! Whiskey selection..Top notch! Happy that I can literally crawl home now from the bar. Lol"}
{"text":"For once, the parking lot wasn't jammed when I passed by, so I got a chance to try it. Worth the wait.

Central concept is a build-your-own burger via a list of items to be checked off, ala Happy Dog. My choices included guacamole and a fried egg. The egg was slightly more gummy than runny, but still that in combination with the guac proved too much for the rye bread I'd chosen; should have gone with the bun.

A good burger overall. None of my add-ons (which also included pickles, raw Vidalia, lettuce, tomato and an aioli) overwhelmed the taste of the meat itself. Me, I prefer more assertive pickles, which is why I really like the pickle bar at the B Spot. But everything was ample.

Fries with \"Irish\" ketchup were a little spicy, which I like. 

I started with the day's special, a cheese-potato-bratwurst soup. Either my tastebuds are fading or the soup, like the burger, didn't have any one dominant note. I liked it, but a brat is a fairly mild sausage. It needed something extra -- a sharper cheese, maybe -- to set it off. And temperature-wise, it was warm but not hot. 

The service was, if anything, too friendly -- I'm not a shake-hands-with-your-server guy. 

I waffled between 3 and 4 stars. From my one experience, it would be a 3 or a 3.5. But the menu earns extra points for being creative, in the same way that the Wild Goose (same owners) gets creative with pizza. In a county full of sameness, creativity should be encouraged. I only worry that the almost complete lack of customers at lunchtime on a Saturday does not bode well."}
{"text":"We were excited to hear that the twisted paddy finally opened last week. We frequent the wild goose and croagh patricks quite often because of the excellent service, beer specials and quality food. This place could potentially be the best of the 3. We ordered the waffle battered chicken bites as an appetizer. Definitely order these on your next visit. Bite sized chicken and waffles! Entrees are focused on burgers. I will be trying each of them soon."}
