{"text":"We love LaRich's and it is our go-to delivery pizza. The pizza and other food are consistently good (eggplant parm & sandwiches) and we love their dessert. The best pizza in our delivery radius."}
{"text":"Their chicken parmesian dinner is the best.  Great sauce, great little salad and the chicken parm is awesome."}
{"text":"The pizza was absolutely terrible, the sauce bland, the crust was like thick cardboard and the employees were truly terrible to deal with. 
Spend your money elsewhere, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Local. 

I love to support local businesses. The 3 \"F\"'s. Family Friendly and Fresh...and LaRich's Pizza is perfect. Makes me feel bad for you west siders...you should come visit! 

Ingredients are always fresh. Everything is made to order. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Italian. What more can you ask for?

Go-To's:
Pizza-just go large. Save some money and pack the extra for lunch the next day.
Calzones. My love. Pick 3 or add some more for the inside and if you are a dipper like I am you will love their homemade sauce.
Pasta...try the Cavatelli, Ravioli or the Jumbo Cheese is a melt in your mouth party you don't want to miss out on.
*Dinners come with a salad and bread for to dip in the extra sauce. Perfection.

Fun fact...you can sit at the Highlander next door and have a drink and even eat at the bar. There is a mini window where your food will be passed through when finished!

Buon appetito!!!"}
{"text":"Usually great pizza. I'm not sure what happened. Ordered one tonight that was so salty that we threw it away. 

Maybe the owner should taste-test once in a while. 

We also ordered wings. For the first time, they were tough and chewy. 

Will probably give them one more chance before moving on to another pizza place. I will update the review then."}
{"text":"I remember LaRich's since the 70s when it was located in the Cedar Green area; one of the favorites for our family when we wanted to go out for pizza.  Now located on Bishop Road and Wilson Mills as a small takeout place, LaRich's is producing some really great pizzas.  

This pizza would be the classic Cleveland style pizza, a medium crust, sweet sauce and provolone cheese.  Right now LaRich's does a great example of this style of pizza.  The sauce is easy to find and just slightly sweet, the cheese coverage is good and gets a bit of tang from the provolone.  Toppings are fresh and generous without overwhelming the pizza.  The star of the pizza for me is the crust, medium thick enough so that the slices don't sag, I would describe the texture as almost Al Dente, not at all crunchy, but with a nice chewiness.  The crust is also just slightly sweet so it is a pleasure to eat.

LaRich's makes a very good pizza that comes together very well, if you are looking for a good pizza give them a try."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time. The flavor of basil and fresh cheese coupled with the obviously, freshly made crust is why Im giving LaRich 5 stars! Great job!"}
