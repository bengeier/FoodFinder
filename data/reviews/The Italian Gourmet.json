{"text":"My wife and I have been to The Italian Gourmet in Newmarket more than ten times (twice for breakfast/brunch) and I feel I can now write an objective review.  We have been to many \"Italian\" food restaurants, in Canada and the US, and this place stood out for me; the serene, low key atmosphere, friendly knowledgeable server, the pleasant ever smiling owner, and of course, the wonderful food.  Authentic is what first came to mind with our first mouthful and with every dish since.    Most are light tomato sauce based without the creamy/cream-based sauces that you find at most restaurants, which are what packs on the calorie counts in those dishes.  The menu selection was simple:  1) Choose the kind of \"flavour\" you crave (11 flavours, I think). Each selection has a recommended pasta to go with it. Ask the server for alternative suggestions if you wish. 2) Match it with your favourite pasta (9 or 10 kinds, imported from Italy) though I almost always choose fettuccine because I've always liked it. 3) Have an appetizer if you want. Several bruschetta toppings available. 4) Order your beverage.  and you will have a made-to-order pasta dish/meal. BTW, my favourites are Olives and Capers in light tomato sauce, Angus beef in tomato sauce, and for breakfast the Casarece Carbonara.  We're looking forward to going back there for breakfast, hopefully this weekend."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast of scrambled eggs with mushroom and Italian sausage. Great mix of flavours and nicely presented. Looking forward to trying the dinner menu."}
{"text":"After a disappointing first experience, I decided to give these guys another try. My first go was 1 star but now I would give them 3-3.5. The bruschetta appetizer and cheese platter were both excellent and the pastas this time were better than our first experience but still just okay. Maybe their pasta is a different flavour of Italian cooking that doesn't appeal to me. For reference, my go-to spots for knock your socks off pasta are Locale (Aurora, King City) and Roman Bistro (Newmarket).  One tip for guests who are not accustomed to \"al dente\" noodles is to ask for your noodles to be cooked well done."}
{"text":"This re-writes the whole idea of breakfast!  While I usually have the standard egg dishes, this is a difference that is refreshing in several ways.    Instead of the usual bacon, eggs, fried potatoes and toast, I had the Italian Gourmet's version.  Two perfectly cooked eggs, but accompanied with Pancetta bacon, a mound of sautéed mushrooms, sautéed red and yellow pepper strips, and a slice of incredibly fresh Bruschetta bread.  Oh, and the potatoes are oven baked, crisp and golden brown with a beautiful flavour.  They don't even own a deep fryer.  But it doesn't stop there.  They have a variety of pasta based breakfast dishes that are from the old country.  I have never considered pasta for breakfast, but I need to try some of their offerings.  The key reason is because of the wall of shelves with their homemade pastas, sauces and preserves.  They go the extra steps, starting with the eggs--they are bathed prior to cooking to kill off any salmonella bacteria.  This is an unusual first step in food safety and speaks to the extra effort to make a quality product.    For about the same price as Sunset or Wimpys, there is little in comparison.   I should not have written this so early in the morning--I'm going there now!!  OK, that was a small mistake on this Wednesday morning.  Note-they open at 11:30 AM M-Th, open at 8:30 only on Friday-Sunday."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for the first time today and I'll definitely be back. Small, quaint and comfy place and the food was absolutely delicious. Best weekend breakfast destination in York region. Bellisima!"}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and the owner (I assume) is very nice.  Food is quite good, portion is average and I can really feel that they are trying their best to focus on using fresh quality ingredients.  However, the place needs a good touch up on decor to make it more comfortable and clean. Otherwise this place deserve a better rating."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian style breakfast and pasta entrees. Very fresh and delicious ingredients. Top notch service and pleasant atmosphere with reasonable prices. Being that it is a smallish restaurant with limited seating, if you are visiting on a Friday or Saturday, I would suggest that you come early to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot.  Breakfast is amazing - try the eggs with sausages truly delicious!  Pasta is done to perfection!   Wait staff is wonderful, explaining each dish and recommending as well"}
