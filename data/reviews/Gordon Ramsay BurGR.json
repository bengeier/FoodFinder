{"text":"Pro tip: be prepared to wait. The restaurant is located near the entrance of the Planet Hollywood Casino. I went for dinner at around 6 and was seated at about 7:30 pm, BE PREPARED TO WAIT! Especially for dinner, I had a party of 3. If it's just a couple they will most likely have you wait in line in front of the restaurant. The hostess were very snotty and I was not told any party that's isn't for two must check in with the hostess and they will text you when your table is ready. I waited for about 20 mins before a hostess came to get information for each couple. At that point I was told to give them my information. There was a huge misunderstanding. Be various of the line, it is best to check in with the hostess first.  Once we were seated, I started off with the sweet potato fries which where delicious. The food overall was probably one of the best gourmet burgers I had. Although I am not a huge fan of over easy egg, the duck bacon was spot on and the combination of both gave it a great pazzaz.  Overall the is a must if your in Vegas. Defiantly worth the wait, it may be pricey for what you are getting but the burger was a mouthful. I would recommend to be spontaneous in what you order because Gordon Ramsey special designed each dish. A job well done!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife decided to try Ramsey burgers and let me tell you they are really good you cant put a price a excellent food. Not to mention the sue chef Daniel Takes pride on his works he make sure we where happy with our burgers. I do recommend Ramsey burgers any time of the day."}
{"text":"One of my favorite \"strip\" places. Love their burgers. Also their jalapeño margarita is good. Go with Truffle fries."}
{"text":"i will keep this short. if you are a burger fan, just go! we had the poppers, the bleu cheese burger, the euro burger, and truffle fries. all of it was delicious! ESPECIALLY THE EURO BURGER. goodness, i crave this burger often (i really love truffle) haha.   service was good, too! we will be back :)"}
{"text":"This place is located conveniently in Planet Hollywood.  Everytime I attempted to go there was a line out the door.  Finally decided to bite the bullet and wait in line.  The wait was not as long as anticipated and once seated the restaurants design is awesome and entertaining.    I had the earth burger and my bf had the farm burger.  Both were very good.  The menu is pretty small.  I was looking forward to maybe a fish burger but there was nothing to be found.  In any case the food was fantastic and I will be back."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Never had such a fantastic burger! The service was excellent and quick, our waiter explained every drink they had with precise detail and made some wonderful recommendations for our group of 7 when it came down to food. Highly recommend this place to any burger fanatic, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and the service was good with regard to her attentiveness. However, because we sat at the bar due to the line, I heard her moan and complain about every single thing. I know I'm in Vegas, but every other word shouldn't be a curse word or bashing of the managers and how they \"chewed\" her \"ass\" for not getting something signed, and she didn't \"give a s*it\"--about ten million times. I thought it was rude and inconsiderate to speak like that in front of customers.   The chipotle ketchup was amazing, and the burger was delicious."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas this past weekend on a family get away.  We watch Gordon on TV and we figured his restaurant had to be good given how he is a top chef.  So we came here and had burgers.  Well to say the least it was complete disappointment.  I had the truffle burger it was undercooked and they just tried to hard.  The ketchup was not even close to ketchup.  Both wife and kids were not impressed and not one of us finished our food.  Anyways good was overpriced and service was slow.  We could live with bad service, however, the food was lacking and Gordon's restaurant took something so basic as a burger and screwed it up trying to make it appear\"Hollywood\". Anyways save your self some time and money and get McDonalds.  Both are crap, but at least McDonald's won't let you down.  On the bright side TV has been great for Gordon's brand as we saw several restaurants with his name on it walking down the strip... Hope they are also not overhyped garbage for unsuspecting folks who believe what they see on tv.  Oh and at the end of the service they give you an iPad to review your service.  All questions are about the servers performance... Perhaps because they don't want feedback on how terrible their food is. What a let down!"}
{"text":"SERVICE: C+  So C+, at best. Didn't receive my beer until we had been seated for about 25 minutes. I had to ask the server if they had brought out the beer yet. She brought it to be promptly after though. Throughout the meal we had to constantly look for our server. Quite surprised, really, at the lackluster performance, especially being at one of Ramsay's establishments.  FOOD: A+  THE BEST damn burger that I've ever tasted in my life. I had the Euro-burger: truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomato. Literally, melts on your tongue. Nothing can really describe it really, but I'll give it a go. Rich, delicious, balanced, loads of umami flavor, succulent. You could say I went to burger heaven and did so completely satisfied.  Girlfriend had the Hell's Kitchen burger. I had a couple of bites and we both agreed it also is delicious. It had nice intense flavors - had some kick, some spices (p.s. personally preferred the euro burger tbh, so if you're into that whole umami, richness go for the euro.)  The appetizer to choose:  jalapeño poppers with one surprise kicker, which is \"supposedly\" fiery. Not so fiery to me, personally. We also had onion rings. A bit doughy, if you ask me, but cooked to perfection. They were just alright partly because I personally prefer panko-style (bread crumb) breading on my onion rings, as opposed to the batter type (kinda like funnel cake).   BEER SELECTION: B+  Of course, it ain't no yardhouse. But I doubt any beer aficionado would come knocking on burGR's doors looking for an exquisite selection at a burger joint. Nonetheless, the selection is above average. I had a pint of La Fin du Monde, which I enjoy occasionally. Not too many IPAs - hope they check into that.  OVERALL: B+  If it weren't for the shitty service, I'd given it a score of A without a doubt, which would've yielded a 5 star rating, too.  TL;DR: Service needs work. Food is perfect. Beers are pretty good. Give it a try when you're in Sin City."}
{"text":"Not sure why this is rated as the #1 burger place in Vegas. This place is so mediocre. I ordered the farm burger and it was nothing special. In n out is a way better option and a fourth of the cost. The fries weren't anything special either. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Everything from the food to the service was AMAZING!!!! We started off with the kale and Caesar salad, which was amazing! I got the uber cheese burger which was probably the best thing I've ever put into my mouth, ever! Like, the cheese was melted amazingly and the burger was cooked to perfection. My fiancé got the Hell's Kitchen burger, and he raved about it. He said it's the best burger he's ever had!!!! We both shared the fries and they were honestly pretty meh. The chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup were okay. But the fries went to meh to YES when she brought out the cheddar ranch which was Devine! Our server was Kelsey and she was one of the best servers we've ever had! Scott, the manager, came by and was very nice! Chef Cristina was running the line that night and it was so cool to watch her in action. Definitely will be coming back here every time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch and it looked like the kitchen was barried and very unorganized. Looked like around 15 cooks and two chefs up front.  Everything took a long time.   The best things we ordered was the Chicken Wings and milk shake ( the shake took 30 minutes.). The Burgers looked great.   The burgers where cooked Medium Rare but they had no seasoning and where dry. Truffle Fries they had no Truffle flavor and the frys where small and falling apart.  Bachi Burger has much better burgers."}
{"text":"We planned on eating at PF Changs but rude staff made us look elsewhere. Blessing in disguise, my family got a table here in about an hour and we got all the kinds of burgers and the truffle fries.  We all agree that this is the best burger restaurant we have gone to. Everything was cooked perfectly and the servers were very attentive.   Try the Truffle Burger and Truffle fries next time you are there. Amazing!"}
{"text":"OMG, the food was so amazing!!!   The cheddar/ranch dip was so unreal. I wish I knew how to make it! My husband and I split the beer battered maui onion rings - SOOOO GOOD! We also split 2 sandwiches... the hell's kitchen burger and the southern yardbird burger. i don't eat chicken sandwiches and this was unreal. It was soooo good.  Our waiter, David, was excellent!!!!   We were not going to come because there was always a line, but it was worth the wait, for sure!!!   Also, if you have a Total Rewards card and you're a platinum/diamond member, you get to skip the line. Also, if you have a party 3+, you get in another line which can expedite your wait, too!   Definitely recommend this place. It was great... I know I have said that a bunch, but the entire experience was extremely pleasant.   Come here!! :)"}
{"text":"Food is good but this place is VERY poorly managed.  It took us 30 minutes to sit down. (not an issue) We order the food, takes about another 30 minutes for three burgers to come out. But wait where are the utensils? we try our best find any server to get us some utensils.. fail. Got up on my own walked over to where the servers keep the utensils and got our own.  Finally 40 minutes after ordering we get to dine with self served utensils. Our server shows up only in the beginning and at the end to give us the bill.   Food is good enough for the price. But the BurGR's will come with a side of GRRRRR..."}
{"text":"The burgers were INCREDIBLE (we got the farm house and the chanterrell mushroom), a great blend of flavors and the server was more than helpful with pairing recommendations (beer/burgers). The servings are a nice size so you may not need an app and fries (although both the onion rings and truffle fries were AMAZING) it was definitely too much food for us. Service fell off after we received our food and no follow up was made until the check was brought to us."}
{"text":"The non-meat burger is average. Unimaginative tomato, cheese and portobello pressed together between some average white bread. It's pressed so hard it feels like it was unfrozen like burgers you get at fast food places. And the speed it was made (5min) is suspicious.  The $17 fish sandwich is very bad. Fish heavily overcooked in deep frier to the point that it's 50% non-edible crust and rest is overcooked fish. It's appalling for this kind of price and I should have demanded a refund.  The truffle fries is the only good thing about this place. Not salted and high quality potatoes."}
{"text":"Very comfortable, (can be slightly loud for your taste) atmosphere, w nice vibe.  Delicious burgers - the three of us ordered a different type each, and we were all not disappointed, including a non-burger fan!  Worth visiting if not frequenting!"}
{"text":"Went back for dinner on April 24, 2017 and the food was excellent as always but service has gone way down hill.  Staff seemed rushed and were not cordial with guests."}
{"text":"Everything about the burger was great except for... the beef.  I ordered it medium and it was definitely red all the way through in the center.  This doesn't scare me as I love steak tartare and rare meat, but there was no seasoning, which left a lot to be desired.  The bun, toppings and sauce were done well, but all in all, I was disappointed.    They also have a gimmicky ipad beer menu, which was fine until I was asked if I was done with it so the next guest could use it."}
{"text":"Overall we had a great lunch at BurGR. My burger was overcooked and a bit dry, but my wife's was perfect and juicy. We went right in the middle of the lunch hour so as expected there was a wait, but they can send you a txt when your table is ready, giving you some time to go plug a few slots.   We had the jalapeño poppers, truffle oil fries and Hell's Kitchen burgers. They also have over 30 beers on tap, so lots to choose from. The shakes looked awesome, but we here too full to indulge.   Aside from the management doing nothing about a very loud, table of cursing, obnoxious drunks, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Well, Gordon Ramsay can criticize any restaurant he wants to in my book. The Hell's Kitchen burger was outstanding... The best I've had. I've never been so thrilled to spend $15.00 on a burger.   Full disclosure: I had a dream last night about going back to Vegas just for this burger. Yeah.   I liked the truffle fries and was especially surprised by the mustard. But next time I think I'll put the nine dollars I spent on my fries towards a second hamburger."}
{"text":"Quick tip: To get seated quickly, get together with friends to form a party of 3 or more.   We ordered a Euro burger, Farm Burger, Chanterelle Burger, truffle fries and onion rings.   Burgers are really good, except very salty! The Euro burger had just the right amount of goat cheese.  Onion rings and fries are very good, not oily and crisp! Dips were great!  Shake #1 and #5 was super thick and sweet.   Wait staff was very attentive and friendly. Our waiter said he really enjoyed working there, especially with the new head chef. And it showed!"}
{"text":"Just like so many others, I love watching Gordon Ramsey on TV. That being said, I had high hopes for Burgr that it didn't quite live up to.  My friends started off with milkshakes and I sampled both. These shakes were huge! I would highly recommend splitting them between two or three people each.  First was the coffee milkshake with chocolate-hazelnut pudding and a praline cookie.  The milkshake tasted  identical to Hagen-Daaz coffee ice cream and the pudding like a more mild Nutella. It was good but not very unique aside from the construction.  The second shake was cookies and cream with creme brulee pudding and an Oreo on top. Each part was delicious, but the flavors did not go together well. It was very rich and creamy, but without a pronounced flavor.  Next, we had the sweet potato fries and onion rings.  The fries had vanilla powdered sugar dusted on them and came with a flavorless custard-like sauce. I'm not really sure what the goal was, but the fries were very good alone.  The onion rings were fried in a tempura batter and were sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. Very delicious. The aioli and curry ketchup they came with were incredibly tasty, and we ended up using those sauces for the fries as well.   And of course we had some burgers. I eat a vegetarian diet about 95% of the time and hadn't had beef in about a year and a half. There was one vegetarian option and it was a mushroom. I really expected there to at least be since kind of housemade patty of some sort, which I've seen every other gourmet burger house (even in Pittsburgh!) This is a choice that gives chefs a lot of freedom to work with interesting ingredients and flavors. The point is.... I hate mushrooms. I ended up going with the Euro Burger because goat cheese. It was perfectly cooked medium rare and very flavorful. Fresh arugula and grilled tomatoes with herbed goat cheese.... Perfect.  Now, why four stars? Because it wasn't anything unique or amazing. It was good, but I've had just as good burgers at many other joints. In Vegas and with a celebrity chef name attached to it, I expect decadence and something unexpected. The menu was nothing special and it was overpriced for just good burgers. I would still recommend this place, but I wouldn't call it a required stop unless you only have Burger King and Red Robin at home. (If you are in Pittsburgh, PA, check out Burgr in Shadyside or one of the Burgatory locations.)"}
{"text":"Don't walk in hungry because you may starve before you're served. We waited 35 minutes for chicken sliders and a hog burger. Both were excellent -- juicy, cooked to perfection, great condiments. The sweet potato fries were dusted with powdered sugar and served with a jalapeño mayo with honey. Way, way too sweet for our tastes and not enough heat.  However, our server happily switched out that condiment for homemade catsup and siracha mayo and both were excellent. Finally a word about the skimpy waitress uniforms.  Horrible.  Too low cut, too short, too tight, holes in the seams, too much T and A. This is not a showgirl venue.  I just want an honest burger without sexism."}
{"text":"I've been to  Burgr 3 times each time there was only a short 5 minute wait.   Food is always excellent.  Parmesan truffle fries will not disappoint!  My only complaint is I've been seated at next to one of the server kiosks a couple times, somewhat annoying having severs hanging out by your table."}
{"text":"Burger is whatever.  Sides are alright.  Dessert skip it.  The only thing going for this place is the service.  Very disappointed with the food.  Would have given a lower rating if it wasn't for our server going above and beyond in getting all sorts of info from the kitchen and allowing use to try some of the sampling jams or creme. Which tasted great on their own, but when combined with the rest of the dish it disappears. Burgers where cooked well, but they had no flavor had some salt at least."}
{"text":"Let's just say one thing: don't expect them to let you in even if you come before closing time. We got to the place at 11:30pm, and there was one party ahead of us - so there was no line to get in. The hostess seats that party and then tells us that they are now closed and that we will not be able to dine there. There were no parties behind us. Okay what the hell was that! The restaurant clearly said it is open until midnight, not until 11:30pm. Absolutely ridiculous and rude. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"For those who did not know, the GR in BurGR stands for Gordon Ramsay.  I had a take out, which took 30 mins to prepare.  Oddly, there were a lot of people standing around though.  The cool part was when they alerted via text when the order is ready.  Hell's Kitchen burger-$14 Fury chicken wings-$14 Just fries- $8 Shake #5 - $9 Total- $49  For almost $50, one would think the burger would be super delicious.  Unfortunately, it was not.  The Hell's Kitchen burger was dry, and bland.  I had to drink a whole bottle of water just to down the burger, and it took 45 mins.  Also, I had a hard time with the shake. I stirred like crazy, and it was still too thick to suck up through the straw.  On the other hand, the chicken wings and fries were pretty good.  In conclusion, for $50, I would prefer to get a bunch of animal styled In-N-out's combos."}
{"text":"I have never been much of a burger person but I love Gordon Ramsey so when I was in town for a work conference, I knew I had to try it. The place was really busy and we were told we would have a 45 minute wait but we were seated probably within ten minutes! I had the Euro Burger. It was so juicy and flavorful! And the Parmesan truffle fries were SO good! Overall, great experience and great food!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes due to Yelp reviews and being backed by the Gordon Ramsay name.    First off it's just after 11pm and there's still a 30 minute wait.  Guess can't really blame the place if they are that popular.  After being seated and ordering right away; 2 burgers, 2 fries and a shake took about 30 mins.  Burgers and shakes even at a fancy burger place shouldn't take 30 minutes.     The burger was pretty good.  Nothing amazing but a solid good.  The truffle fries were WAY too salty.   The creme brûlée Oreo shake started out pretty good.  Once the top part (creme brûlée) was mixed into the Oreo part; it became unbearably sweet.    Maybe they were having an off night...???"}
{"text":"Awesome Burger! Good service. Good looking workers. The truffle fries are killer. More than ample servings. I went back twice in my four day trip. I had the Uber Cheese Burger and will get it again when I travel back! Thanks GR and staff!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fast, loud, and fun, the food is amazing. I had the Farm Burger and was very satisfied, without a doubt the best burger in my life! I also had an order of the Truffle Fries, which were delicious, but these steak fries portion was so big that the two of us could not even finish half of the order. They have a decent beverage selection, the service was not only fast and friendly, but also very easy on the eyes as well."}
{"text":"Even before you set foot into the restaurant, you may be welcomed with a long waiting line. If you do, keep calm and line up, as the line moves faster than you think. I'm not sure if you are able to make reservations beforehand, but ask the hostess if it's possible. The restaurant sadly doesn't take reservations online.  The menu is very simple, it's all on one page with 5-10 selections for each category. A more visible quality of the menu can be found here. We did our research about BurGR before coming, so we ordered two burgers (The Hell's Kitchen Burger and Farm Burger), truffle parmesan fries, and two shakes for dessert (Shake #4 and #5). We also ordered a beer from the drinks list which was available by iPad when you asked your server.  The restaurant was very lively with no empty tables. We were very excited to try our gourmet burgers because it was voted as the 'Best Tourist Food that's \"Actually Good\"' by Vegas Seven in 2013. I was too excited about their curry ketchup, truffle aioli, burgers of course, and their ultimate shakes that everyone kept raving about. The atmosphere was quite cozy because of the large fireplace at BurGR, but the busy restaurant came hard upon the servers and so the service we received wasn't anything great.  Not so long after, our meals started to arrive. Starting with the fries, they were very crispy, none of them soggy from too much oil, and had truffle salt and truffle parmesan on top. You could really smell the real truffle from the fries which I was very surprised about. Normally, and when I had tried truffle fries before at other burger joints, I was never able to smell or taste the truffle in the fries; however, along with the truffle aioli, these fries were serious about their truffle! Hubby and I were very, very happy people...now we can't have truffle fries anywhere else.  We asked for a side of curry ketchup with our truffle fries because many recommended we do so. The curry ketchup is available when you order their \"Just fries\". I don't think it cost us extra for the side, but even if there was a surcharge, we would've gotten it anyway. After trying my french fries with curry ketchup, I realized I want lots of it at home. I wish it was available for purchase everywhere and anywhere. The combination of ketchup and curry was perfect.  I chose to have the Farm Burger which had duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. I mostly ordered it because of the duck meat because I've never had duck breast bacon before, and also never had it in my burger as a topping. After trying the burger, I found the bacon actually a little too salty so a little overpowering for my taste. It was great at first, but as I slowly finished my burger, I realized it was getting saltier and saltier, and there were not enough toppings inside the burger to offset the saltiness. Yes, the fried egg was a good touch, and it wasn't overcooked, but it wasn't enough to balance the saltiness. Now that I think about it, the Farm burger sounds like a good thing to eat for brunch...I mean, it has bacon, cheese, and egg inside your burger! Overall, the burger was great, but compared to the Hell's Kitchen Burger, it ranked second in our books.  The Hell's Kitchen burger is probably the best burger we had ever tried so far in our lives. Complete with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomatoes, you know it's a good burger at first bite. There wasn't really anything that we didn't like about the burger, other than the fact that I didn't order it! The rich, savoury flavours were balanced out by the avocado, and instead of your standard ketchup, the real roasted tomatoes were great. Next time we're in Vegas, I know for sure that we are going back to BurGR and ordering this again! This burger is a must try when you're at BurGR!  Of the two shakes that we tried, this oreo shake was my favourite, while hubby preferred the coffee shake. Shake #4 is an oreo shake with creme brûlée pudding on top as well as an oreo cookie. I needed to order this and try it because the oreo cookie is my favourite snack. I couldn't really imagine how oreo and creme brûlée would taste together, but whatever happened in BurGR's kitchen, the combination was SO GOOD. The rich sweetness can probably be overpowering for some (ie. my hubby), but if you have a sweet tooth, you'd probably thank me for introducing this shake to you. Shake #5 is probably a better choice if you want to try something less sweeter, although it's still quite sweet. I know the amount of calories in these shakes are probably heart attack worthy, but I'd rather run for 10 miles after my meal instead of not trying it!  Overall, I believe this is how a burger joint should be done. In my opinion, it is better than Shake Shack, Umami burger, In-n-out Burger, and all other independent burger chains out there. If you're a burger lover, this place must be on your to-do list! To me, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is a must try!"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! The curry ketchup for the fries was unexpectedly amazing too. This is my first time in Las Vegas so I had to visit a GR restaurant. @burgr was an excellent choice."}
{"text":"The jalapeño poppers and hummus were the best part of the meal. I got the garden burger; the bacon was flavorless and I only got one strip. Overall it was a pretty lackluster burger that wasn't worth the 15 dollars. The plain fries were dry and flavorless. The waiter also never put ice in my water after he brought me my glass."}
{"text":"The food and service was outstanding but I saw something that really disturbed me.... I was sitting with my friend having my drink when I saw a larger asian man grab a tiny (and these girls are super tiny, their uniforms are not meant for anything larger than a size 8) female server rather aggressively by her arm. And I don't mean a gentle tug, I mean a very aggressive and forceable yank, which was then followed by a rather nasty talking-to. IN full view of guests.  I am so shocked that a manager would out right physically and verbally assault an employee, much less in full view of guests. I work in the industry and if anyone ever touched me like that, I would call the police. I am so ashamed of myself for not speaking up at the moment. I'm going to have to think long and hard about ever coming to this establishment again."}
{"text":"First of all. I'm a fan of chef ramsay and hope every thing perfect.  This is first time i try this burger.  When i walk to the host two girl cute asian just talk to each another and doesn't look at me. Until o ask for table for 1 they offer me to sit at bar it ok for me but she just point to bar and say go ahead snd back to talk to each another again.  The burger need more salt it no test and asian salad is so so. It not matt for 14$ for burger and 13 for salad. In&out is alot bettet."}
{"text":"I got the euro burger and there wasn't anything special about it. I liked how the bun was soft. Also got the garlic Parmesan fries and sweet potato fries. Parm fries were too dry and didn't like the cut. Sweet potato fries tasted good. There were other sauces that came with the fries but I prefer just ketchup. Overall expected more from the food since it is from Gordon Ramsey."}
{"text":"We went here today as part of Restaurant Week and wow was the food good, service not so much! I called to see if we needed reservations and was told we did not. Fortunately we arrived at 11:45 so we were seated by 12p while all those behind had at least 20-30 min waits. Once seated in this busy restaurant we waited for our server for some time before waiting to have our water delivered and then waited again to order, and on and on. The food was worth the wait though, I ordered the Britannia Burger and it was delicious the combination of the extremely moist burger with the mango chutney was amazing and I will certainly be trying to recreate it at home. My boyfriend had the Hell's kitchen burger and while it was good it was by no means spicy. The buns are buttery and delicious and I would definitely recommend this spot. We shared the onion rings and sweet potato fries, both good but the onion rings are by far the better choice. The dessert course was sticky toffee pudding push pops and were good not great. I would certainly visit again if I was in the area but it is a bit pricey even if it was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Seriously, people like the food?  Ambiance is fun, service is good to excellent thus the two stars.   Had the farm burger and the American burger, the meat tasted like processed meat or  a cheap meatloaf cut into slices.  The burger was cold, in fact both of them were cold.   I've had meatier tasting meat, I swear I was vegetarian that night and was eating a soy patti.  Alas, morning star veggie Patty  tasted better than this!  Shocked at the good review of the food:  this hamburger did not compare to in and out burger!! Shame, bc Chef Ramsey is always so hard on people s food and his name is on a restaurant with this kind of food, makes you wonder if he ever tried it...  reality tv... sigh..."}
{"text":"I really want to give BurGR 4.5 stars, but Yelp won't let me.  We visited in a group of 10 this past Friday night around 9pm, with no reservation.  I love restaurants, including BurGR, that will put your name on the list and text you when your table is ready, so you can roam around instead of hovering by the entrance.  We were quoted an hour and a half, but the wait only ended up being about 15 minutes.  Either way, we would have been fine because the lobby opens up into the Planet Hollywood casino, so we would have had no trouble entertaining ourselves.  I am generally suspicious of celebrity chef-owned restaurants, because it seems that once they get a tv show, the chefs are not very involved in their restaurants.  Honestly, I would not have chosen BurGR had we not been traveling with a large group.  But I could not have been more pleasantly surprised with the quality of the experience.  Service, food and drinks were excellent and the prices are incredibly modest for a resort on the Strip.  $7 for a craft beer and $14 for a gourmet burger is in line with what we pay at good burger places at home.    My boyfriend and I usually eat at independently owned restaurants, avoiding chains and touristy joints, and we were both very happy with our meal here.  I had a delicious jalapeño tequila cocktail and the Brittania burger.  He had an off-menu pork burger and a draft beer.  We split the truffle parmesan fries and one of the milkshakes.  My only criticism is that the truffle fries were not as crispy as I would have liked, but the flavor was still great.    There is a lot of mediocre, overpriced food on the Las Vegas Strip, but BurGR was our best meal on the Strip in 3 days.  If I'm ever in town again, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"My companion's quote \"that's the Best burger I've ever had\"...........well he does get out some so he can say this............we had the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Blue Burger with onion rings. The burgers were juicy, fresh and flavorful. The onion rings were light and crispy. The food portions were more than we expected too. We waited only a short time in line before being seated.............well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We've tried both of Chef Ramsay's other restaurants here in town decided it was time to get the last one out of the way.  We stopped in after work on Friday afternoon after work (about 4:00) and got good seats right near the kitchen where we could watch everyone working.  We really wanted to like the place, but it just didn't live up to expectations.  Initial observations:    1. The wait time was short--only about 5 minutes from the time we got in line until we were seated.    2. It's a hundred and a bazillion degrees outside--why is the line right next to flaming \"artwork?\"    3. More tacky outfits for the hostesses and waitresses.  We understand the premise, but they just aren't flattering; at least not on the women here.    4.  Hostesses are carrying around the iPad paperweights just like at GR Pub & Grill.  We thought we'd be looking at them to order our drinks, but after seating us, she took it with her.  It was only a few minutes after being seated that the waiter showed up and took our drink orders.  I thought that this was also a bar where I could order a bear with my burger, but apparently not.  No beer in sight on the menu--strange since they have beer glasses for sale at the front of the restaurant.  Learned later that yes, the airhead that was our hostess was supposed to leave the iPad with us.  Of course, our waiter (who never gave us his name) didn't even ask about alcoholic drinks or let us know that they were available.    We thought we'd order different burgers and split them between us so we could sample more than one while we were here.  Brenda ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger (avocado, jalapeno, and roasted tomato) without the jalapeno, and I ordered the Farm Burger (duck bacon, fried egg, and French cheddar).  We also ordered both the sweet potato fries and the truffle Parmesan fries.  We had them bring the fries out first so we could snack on them while we waited for the burgers to arrive. The waiter left with our order and we never saw him again until it was time to pay the bill.  While we waited for our food we watched the drama in the kitchen.  One of the food runners must have been having a bad day because every time we saw her in the kitchen area she was crying and the expediter was spending his time consoling her.  Another of the employees working the pass was so short that she couldn't reach the food that the staff was putting under the heat lamps.  We watched two orders of fries sit there for the 15 minutes it took to get us our food.  A food runner brought us our fries and we think she was explaining what the different dipping sauces were that came with each order.  The Parmesan fries come with an aioli mayo and ketchup and the sweet potato fries come with some sort of jalapeno dip and a powdered vanilla sugar.  The sweet potato fries were excellent--nice and crispy although Brenda thought the sugar made them just a bit too sweet.  The truffle Parmesan fries had good flavor, but were limp and soggy without any hint of crispness; almost as if the oil they were cooked in wasn't hot enough.  I enjoyed the sauces that came with both fries.  Brenda really didn't care for either and thought they overpowered the sweet potato fries.  When our burgers arrived, we cut each and half to share.  Both burgers were cooked as ordered--medium on the Hell's Kitchen burger and medium rare on the Farm.  The Hell's kitchen burger was OK, but nothing to get excited about.  The burger itself was seasoned well; however, it just lacked that wow factor.  It could be that the jalapeno was supposed to add that, but unfortunately, not everyone can eat jalapenos.  The Farm Burger was fantastic.  As soon as we sliced into it, the egg yolk oozed down the sides.  This is one burger you probably want to eat with a knife and fork. The duck bacon added a nice smoky flavor to it, although Brenda thought it was a bit heavy for her tastes.  All during dinner, one of the busboy/runners kept our drinks filled at all times.  He was by our table when our waiter finally showed up to give us the check and noticed the card was from USAA and immediately struck up a conversation about the military.  Semper Fi, Marine!  You were the only bright spot out of the entire wait staff.  When the waiter came back with the receipt and card, he made the mistake of handing it to me and ignoring Brenda (who was paying the bill).  If we hadn't found out from the Marine that they pool tips here, this waiter would have gotten a big fat zero tip.  All in all it wasn't a bad experience--it just wasn't what we were expecting after eating in Ramsay's other restaurants.  The food was ok, but for the price it should be a lot better than Red Robin.  The service, with the exception of one person, pretty much sucked--not sure if the Culinary Union has their hooks in this place, but if they do, that could explain the service problems.  Hopefully this will be like GR Pub & Grill and the second visit will be better than the first."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas 10-30-15. Walked by BurGR and decided we would have something to eat since we both enjoy GR's shows. It was a huge disappointment! The restaurant was not full but we decided to sit at the bar. Bartender (female) was so busy on her cell phone that after 15 minutes a second bar tender arrived and asked for our drink order. No one else was sitting at the bar and no other drinks were being made during this time! We then ordered burgers and were told it would be 25 minutes. After 40 minutes we asked for progress and were told it would be another 25 minutes. After sitting for an hour we paid our drink tab and left. Why it takes 25 minutes even for a premium burger is beyond me. The lack of customer care was impressive for a situation where the competition in food service is huge. Also disappointing is a TV star who's focus is on perfection puts his name on a poorly run establishment. We ate elsewhere that evening and see no reason to try another GR restaurant brand."}
{"text":"The actual burgers are awesome, but the fries are not worth the price. The restaurant is loud, and everything was a little sticky. Our server was helpful and pleasant."}
{"text":"My second time here, I ordered the same items I fell in love with the first time, Euro Burger and the Sweet Potato Fries with vanilla powdered sugar, it's like nothing I have tried before.  The place is very trendy (menu on iPad), with friendly staff and it's usually packed, for a reason.  They put out some beautiful looking burgers, cooked to perfection.  I'll be visiting this place every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"So I show up to grab a burger from BURGR, of course the line was about an hour wait, but when the hostess saw me she said I can go straight to the bar so good eye for that. The bar was packed but no worries. I ordered a Black Magic and sat down Lala has the perfect pour and with 30 beers on tap you can't go wrong.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and parm truffle fries both were on point, I am certain this will become a favorite spot for me."}
{"text":"Ummm not as good as I expected. I honestly don't think the burgers were as good, the wings were decent, ketchup was weird, the fish and fritz were great though. Prices are decent. Would recommend it just to try it out but not my personal favorite place for burgers."}
{"text":"Burger was cooked to perfection and the fires were a nice touch. I would likely avoid the milkshake as a drink next time and stick with one of the beers they have on tap. Good atmosphere and attentive wait staff. Really what I expected from a Gordon Ramsay establishment."}
{"text":"The food was good but the burgers are pretty small. I ended up paying about $30 for a burger and some fries. The food was good quality but I would not frequent this place just because of the small portions. It was a fun experience and I am glad I tried it out though.   I feel kind of bad for the wait staff. The skin tight dresses that the ladies had to wear were not very flattering even though the waitresses were not overweight."}
{"text":"Got there at 7PM just before what looked like the dinner rush with a party of 3 on Tuesday night.  Got seated fairly quickly and the service was great.  Ordered the farm burger, fries, and a shake.  If you plan on eating fries get one order to share between 2-3 people because they are very generous with their portions!  The burger was amazing, but shake #3 really stole the show for me.  My friends ordered Shakes #2 and #4 as well and all were equally as delicious.  Total bill came out to about $40-50 per person.  A very good place to start off your visit to Vegas with.  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Long lines, and super greasy food. The food is less than average fast food style; nothing special at all. Avoid ordering drinks because all drinks are super sugary and taste like melted candy. I was extremely disappointed because I love Chef Ramsey and Ramsey steak restaurant is one of my family's favorite."}
{"text":"We loved the garlic truffle dipping sauce that came with the truffle fries!  I think it was just mayonnaise with minced garlic and truffles, but it was delicious!  Without the dipping sauce the fries were just okay, the truffle flavor definitely comes from the sauce.  I had the farm burger; the duck bacon was salty and meaty!  My husband had the blue burger.    Whenever we passed by, there was a long line outside the restaurant.  I think that was the initial reason we wanted to eat there!  On our last day, we lined up at 10:50 a.m. (10 minutes before opening) and we were seated promptly at 11:05.  Overall, it's kind of pricey, $40 for two burgers and fries (before tip).  But it's worth checking out if you want to try one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants on a budget."}
{"text":"Amazing meal, not too long to wait, the food was really good and the service was smily and done with professionalism."}
{"text":"Just awesome! The atmosphere and staff really make this place one of a kind. Hillary immediately sat us at the bar where we were greeted extremely nicely by Tiffany, and chef chad. The food was delicious but the staff really made this a great experience. I highly recommend stopping here if you are in Vegas. Thanks again BURGR!"}
{"text":"Good food, fun atmosphere. Gooey fries were very good. Rich for sure, so better off shared than individually getting fries. Burgers come a la cart, but they are large in size and with one shared fry you should be good. I had a drink that was great, forgot the name though. Acai antioxidant something??? Refreshing and the perfect amount of sweet. Unfortunately had a ROCK in our fries that my fiancé bit down on. Manager was nice enough to comp the fries. But what the hell was a rock doing in the kitchen? Anyways if you wanna grab a bit to eat this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Long lines, but Yummy burgers! Check it out when you are wondering around Vegas sometime. Some of us stayed in line while other played at the penny slots 10 feet away. I won enough to pay the check! Score!"}
{"text":"Someone please ask gordon ramsey to leave las vegas. This is the second place I have eaten with his name associated. The wait is obnoxious the food third rate. Poorly cooked second rate beef and if you sell truffle put truffle on it..Over priced dry over cooked food. This guy is NOT a chef. If there was a \"zero stars\" I would have selected.  Gordon Ramsey is a farce  please stop your TV shows and learn to cook"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, our server was great. Very attentive. My group got a bunch of appetizers and they were all delicious. Stand outs were definitely the jalapeno poppers and the fury wings. Both were amazing. I was very disappointed by the burgers. Everything I tried was bland. And in comparison to the appetizers, I was surprised. Prepare yourself for a 3 hour meal. We waited over an hour, which is expected and it took 2 hours for us to get our food-which didn't matter because we were having a good time. Go for the appetizers but for a place named BURGR and a 90 minute wait, I expected a lot more from the main dishes."}
{"text":"The only time I've had a burger and didn't once consider adding ketchup because of the flavor being so good without.  Also hardly any grease great texture.  Lived up to my expectation and beyond"}
{"text":"Mega Burger...man muss wohl meistens anstehen, aber es lohnt sich...das Fleisch von hoher Qualität, auch die Brötchen ungewohnt lecker und die \" handgeschnittenen\" Pommes richtig lecker... Preis-Leistung ist super!!... Bedienung war sehr nett"}
{"text":"Excellent place for burgers our waiter Alex was awesome as well. The onion rings are the bomb. I had the blue cheese burger which was great. Cooked perfectly. This is somewhere I recommend you stop when in Vegas. Wait time can be a bit if your party is more than 2. Have the sweet potato fries too. Only need to order one side they are pretty large. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Great burger with bacon and blu. Cooked to perfection. Savory. Not over the top with flavor but it will knock you back ... In a good way.   But who sells a burger with no fries. $7 more?!  If I turn the fried down twice, there is really no need to ask me again.   Also, the universal sign for 'I want to pay my check' is my card in the glass with the check. No need to keep me waiting 10min to pay. That was made up in the tip."}
{"text":"Overall good value. Vegas style. But no vegetables. Well except for fries. Still. Would go again."}
{"text":"Excited to go to BurGR. Don't go out for burgers all that often, but we loved the ones we ordered - Earth and Farm Burgers. They were juicy and moist, not dried out and just old bread. Truffle Parmesan Fries could have been crisper but were very tasty. Hoped for a wider selection of beers which seemed a bit reserved."}
{"text":"I thought this would be another over hyped celebrity restaurant...but no, one of the best burgers I have ever had. The farm burger is excellent and because it was so good I went back two days later and tried the hog burger and it did not disappoint. The Parmesan Truffle fries is a must have also!"}
{"text":"Not that great at all.  There are much better burger choices in town!  Bobbies Burger Palace has a much better tasting and juicier burger than this place.  I ordered the All American burger with bacon, and it was marginal..  no flavor.  Others in our party ordered the chicken sandwich burger, which was also marginal.  The 2nd star is for the butterscotch shake - -  but that was $10!  The shake actually tasted like a bowl of pudding.  Summary:  In n Out, Fatburger, and Bobby's Burger Palace all kicks this places' ass.  Don't waste a lot of money and wait time on a hyped, barely edible burger.  Nothing special here."}
{"text":"Burgr blew me away! I highly recommend the onion rings which left me dying for more! The cheddar ranch sauce was the perfect sauce for the rings.   Everything about the burger was spot on! He pickles tasted fresh from a canning room. The meat was flavorful and juicy.   Everything about the restaurant was perfect! There is a reason why Gordon is at the top of the game!"}
{"text":"I was here on Sun and this was their 2nd day (1st lunch opening).  This place was amazing!  It's like an upscale sports bar and since I went on a Sunday, it was perfect for Sunday football!  The openness of the restaurant was very inviting.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers.  The presentation of the poppers was nice and they were in individual shot glasses with their own dip.  It was good especially if you like spicy food like myself.  The only downfall of the burger was that I ordered my burger medium and they cooked it well done.  It was still good so I kept on eating it.  So despite what I wanted, it was still very tasty and I was quite pleased with the manager's attentiveness to the situation."}
{"text":"I was staying at planet Hollywood and didn't feel like searching for a place to eat on the strip, so I decided to keep in simple and eat here. Let me just start by saying that I don't even eat burgers like that, and it isn't my go to when I eat out. But after coming here I left a changed person! Haha. The food was delicious, the atmosphere was great, and the service was excellent. Gordon Ramsay is a food genius! If you want to leave satisfied then order the Hell's Kitchen and truffle fries.. They are mouthwatering. Price is high, but worth it. Me and my mom could not stop raving about it. Now I see why the line was out the door. I will definitely be back on my next trip to sin city!"}
{"text":"Went here expecting top notch food and service. Only got good food. The service was bad. The waitress we had was horrible. She was too busy chatting with coworkers and not checking the customers. The food took about an hour to get. The waitress went AOL had to flag down a different waiter for help. I left a .25 cent tip. I won't go back. If I'm paying 50 dollars for two burgers and fries and a couple of cokes I want good service or at least average service."}
{"text":"The burgers here are amazing. They are cut back to the basics, with no frills and focussing on taste! A great location in Planet Hollywood on the strip. A truly great experience!"}
{"text":"Expected more from the burgers to be honest. Wasn't satisfied with them. The wait time was about 30 minutes to get in and another 25 minutes for the food. The hype is what got us. Finally got the burgers we ordered and at first bite just wasn't \"wowed\". Just another burger joint but I did appreciate the ordering system and the decor! Very appealing. The Parmesan fries were good compared to the regular ones (don't order, you're better off getting the parm ones)  To finish our experience off, we had their creative desserts, the shakes! Now that was something different because they had pudding at the top. The cookie in the pudding is thin and very crunchy which was a plus. So, overall it was a good first and last time for me. Just wanted to experience Gordon's take on burgers."}
{"text":"Food was delish! The service was fast, and the wait ended up being shorter than expected. The only thing was it was so so busy, so it was hard to get to our server, and I thought the burger was a LITTLE small, besides that everything from the  Parmesan fries to the milkshakes and ambiance were perfect."}
{"text":"Guy was our waiter and Kurtis was our busman, they are both amazing,  attentive and very sweet. Kurtis even sung a song for me from the Lord of the Rings at the end our meal. I they are amazing employees and wonderful people. Cannot recommend them enough."}
{"text":"Food flavors were great service was terrible the waitress Spilled water on us never came to clean it up we had to send a burger back twice because it wasn't cooked to our specifications and they forgot a burger"}
{"text":"The only bad thing I can say about BurGR is the wait to get in. My wife and I went to BurGR a couple times for lunch during our most recent visit to Vegas. Food is Excellent, the Shakes are over the top good. Service was also good during both our visits. If it wasn't for the wait time to get in, this review would have been five stars."}
{"text":"Burger Nightmare!  Love his food and his other locations....wanted to try this out while in town and could not have been move disappointed.  First .....the Hostess could not have been more put off to try help us.  we showed up on a Wednesday at 1pm and there was a crowd out the door......45 min wait so we put our name in with the girl that never smiled or even look up at you.  Quoted a time to be sat at 1:53.  we found a small table by the host stand and watched.  We could not believe how many tables sat empty or dirty and yet every time someone got sat the hostess would walk by and the first thing out of her mouth was....we are sorry for wait.....really??  With a little motivation and direction from the guy that saves restaurants you wanted to believe they have move the wait time down to 10 mins with a little effort!  we saw the managers walking around looking busy.....looking being the key word because no one in the place moved with any sense of energy or direction including them.  A restaurant staff takes on the personality of the management team and it was in 2nd gear and going through the motions.  Was finally told that we were next at 1:50....we laughed because we could still see 4 dirty tables and 3 clean at any given time during the wait.  took miss personality 10 mins to make us next.  Got the well rehearsed speech about sorry for the long wait going to our table....i had to laugh.  OK sitting at 1pm..... finally at 1:10 a server shows up and since we had all the time in the world to look at the menu ....we ordered everything then!  1:20 our ice teas showed up from a busser that was the best employee they have.  She smiled, was engaging and made sure our ice tea never sat empty. We found out she was a server and asked to be demoted.....wow is that a statement!  1:39 the food shows up.....2 burgers and 2 orders of fries....29 mins?    at this point i saw a manger go over to the dirty table sitting next to us (had been sitting dirty at least 5 mins) and move a glass or 2 around and push in the chairs.....did not help or clear 1 item.  Herd the same excuse from the host again when if finally got sat......had to laugh again.  we had the Euro burger and Hells Kitchen burger with Truffle fries and reg fries. Food was awesome!    Had to ask twice for the bill and at the end of it all $72 with tip for 2 burgers, 2 orders of fries and 2 ice teas.......NOT WORTH IT!  Hey Gordon....let me know when you are going to save this nightmare.....i would love to watch!  They need your help....."}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and both times, the burger was the BEST burger I've had in my entire life. The prices might seem a little steep for a burger (from $15 and up), but it is well worth it because they give you quality meat that is thick and cooked well to your liking. The bread is so fresh and has just the right crunch and texture to it. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which had jalapenos, tomato, and avocado in it. Neither the jalapenos nor the avocado overpowered the flavoring of the meat. I would go so far to say that it was PERFECTION!   My boyfriend ordered the Farm burger, and we shared an order of Truffle fries which, according to him, \"tasted like heaven.\" The bill came out to be about $50 for 2 burgers and fries, but it was the best and most memorable meal we had in Vegas. I'd want to go back and try all the different burgers."}
{"text":"I came here Labor Day weekend on a Sunday night. My friend and I arrived 5:30 pm and it took about an hour and a half for our table even though there were lots of empty tables.  Service: Our waiter (I think his name is Jay) never checked up on us. I noticed that he was busy flirting with a table full of women... The only thing he did was take our order and give us the check. But on the other hand, the busboy (Dane??) was amazing. He always kept refilling people's water glasses. My glass was never close to being half empty. He was very friendly and attentive as well.   Food: My friend and I shared the Hell's Kitchen Burger, Truffle fries, and an order of Onion Rings. It was about $40 for all the food. The burger was just mediocre, nothing special. I believe it was suppose to come with jalapenos but my burger did not have any. The onion rings were very crispy and tasty. The truffle fries were barely lukewarm when I received it so I was not a big fan of that.  I guess I had higher expectations for this restaurant since Gordon Ramsey's name is on this place, but overall I probably would not come again."}
{"text":"GORDON RAMSAY IS THE KING OF TRUE AMERICAN GRUB!   This place was amazing! So good in fact that I came here 2 days in a row while on vacation in Vegas. The service was really good and friendly. The Onion rings were the best I have ever had. The Fries were a-ok. The Jalapeño Poppers were served hot, crispy, and spicy in all the right ways. The Hot Dogs were phenomenal. Really, really good. The burgers were cooked to perfection! The Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Pops were not too sweet but a good dessert. THE OREO SHAKE WITH CREME BRULEE ON TOP WAS THE MOST AMAZING SHAKE THAT HAS EVER GRACED MY TONGUE.   Don't hesitate to eat here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite meals of all time are burgers and fries and after coming here twice I have to say that the burgers here are by far the best burgers I've ever had. My personal favorite is the \"Hell's Kitchen Burger\" paired with truffle fries. You absolutely HAVE to get truffle fries!! If you've never had truffle before, now is the time to try it because the flavors pair well with the parmesan cheese and the chipotle ketchup (or truffle sauce). The burgers are very distinct from a \"typical\" burger because they are grilled with apple and alder wood. The wait is typically an hour or more BUT IT'S SO WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Decent ambience but felt like this place was just 'phoning it in'. The burgers were good although my friend didn't like the fries at all. I felt they were fine although they were more like steak fries.  Considering the burgers don't come with fries, is a little pricey for what you get. Service was good with our waiter being attentive.  Overall, nothing special but could see myself returning if I was hungry and close by."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had yet!  I had the farm burger which comes with \"duck bacon\" that didn't sound too good, but was 100% delicious bacon. Fried egg need i say more?  The truffle fries where great with the house ketchup, but the truffle sauce was heavy and taste like mayo"}
{"text":"more like 2.5 stars, but the burger was the worst part of the meal so i can't justify giving 3 stars.  service was great. i got there before the lunch rush so i didn't have to wait to be seated.  sadly i think the best value item on the menu was the hummus which was actually very good. it came with a nice presentation of crudites and toasted pita chips. off to a good start, or so i thought.  i got the uber cheese burger which was sub-par. the cheese flavor was good, but it overpowered the beef. i'm assuming grass-fed beef isn't used, because it didn't taste like it and wasn't advertised as such, but it would have helped. the patty was overworked so it came out dry. there was not one drop of burger juice drippings on my plate! when i make a burger at home they are juicy, not so at burgr which is kinda pathetic for a better burger joint. the bun was good, but it must have been put on after my burger had cooled a bit because there was no cheese stuck to the bun when i pulled it off. price was average for a place on the strip but the quality was lacking.  i also got the parmesan truffle fries which were really good, but they were almost as expensive as the burger! the house-made sauces were pretty good, too.  overall it was a disappointment. i can make a better burger at home for a lot less cash. there are so many good places to go in vegas; i will not be back."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about a celebrity chef take on a burger joint, but it was adjacent to our hotel so we decided to give it a go. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. BurGR serves up delicious-- you guessed it-- burgers that are fresh, well-cooked, and smothered in tasty toppings. You can't go wrong with the truffle parmesan fries or onion rings. Both come with homemade condiments (truffle aioli-- get in my belly!!) in a cone that could feed at least 2-3 people.   The one downside-- nothing makes me hungry LESS than seeing buttcheeks peaking out of the server's uniforms. I get it, we are in Vegas. Let's be trendy. Let's not put nice young ladies in teeny tiny Jetson-style dresses that barely cover their rump roasts (OH BEEF PUNS!)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and booze. They were having a bad day on service with a few people out but were really friendly and apologetic, which made up for any delays.  I had the roasted jalapeño poppers. They were crispy, tangy, good amount of heat,the hint of bacon flavor & fun presentation.  The other thing worth writing about was the skinny acai lemonade. One of the best cocktails I've had. The agave gave it a deeper sweetness than the usual sickly sweet syrup in cocktails. I definitely recommend it for a refreshing buzz."}
{"text":"Good, not spectacular. Service was strong and the beer selection good. It's Vegas so expect to pay more for less. The Farm Burger was very decent and I don't have too much to complain about but some of the others really lacked flavor and punch. Fries were huge and enough to share between 3-4 people (assuming you aren't teenage dudes or football players). Overall the quality was good but I doubt it will wow you."}
{"text":"Amazing. It was some of the best food we had in Vegas. And the service was fantastic. I had been kind of disappointed with that while here but Ramsay's burgers definitely fits what you think when you discuss Vegas food and service. The combinations on the burgers are unique and delicious! Definitely give the japaleno poppers a chance!"}
{"text":"I liked the decor it is a very nice location the burgers themselves are fancy. I have tired many burgers places and I can't say this was the best.  1)The wait in line was 30 min  2)Food after being ordered took 25 min 3)Very friendly staff 4)Burgers are good not great  This is about as honest as a review can get"}
{"text":"First off the ambiance was breath taking without completely killing the wallet. The staff was amazing and professional. Be prepared to chose your favorites! The fries had 2 sauces, the onion rings had 2 sauces and every burger has a variety of toppings. There was quite a wait for a burger place but my husband and I understand cause after all it is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant; but that being said it was about a 30-45 min wait which really wasn't that bad. I would recommend the truffle parmesan fries which on there own is amazing but the sauces will make you keep eating when you're full."}
{"text":"It was alright nothing really special actually preferred the onion rings to the burger."}
{"text":"We love the truffle parmesan fries! I think we loved it even more than the burger. We ordered Hell's Kitchen burger and just shared it coz we went there for a midnight snack after a concert. We left the restaurant satisfied.  We had a hard time looking for it at first though. We didn't see it in the directory. Some of the concert personnel we asked didn't know where it was located either.   The staff was very attentive and they kept on asking if we needed anything. Good service!"}
{"text":"Best Pork Burgers on the West Coast Period  If you're going here to eat, just get the pork burger, it's what you should get and what you will totally, totally enjoy. Your mouth will actually make out with you as a thank you for ordering this tasty BurGR. Skip everything else, just get that. And a beer too. It is as good as it gets! Drools....  Another thing I noticed about the burger, it was really, really neatly made. Lettuce, toppings, and meat were all in one place. Not hanging out, not sticking out, just really neat. It was like they put that much more effort into the burger! I've never seen a burger this neat! It made everything taste that much better! Everything distributed so evenly and soo easy to eat. Soo oh so good.  Just pay attention to the burger when it comes out, it's really neat!"}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! Avoid talking to the hostess Mandy, she yells at her coworkers in front of people and is rude to customers."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, I had the chanterelle - yum! Really good fries too. My only complaint was that the restaurant was only about 1/4 full and it took a really loooong time to get our food."}
{"text":"Burger is good.  Not great.  Had the hells kitchen burger.  Not a bad burger.  Fries are large cut fries.  Good.  The oreo shake was fantastic.  Why just a 3 star?  When you pay over 13 bucks for a burger...  it should be better than you average burger.  Staff was helpful and bartender/server was fantastic."}
{"text":"If this was a review of the food only it would be a 5 star review. The food is terrific and well worth a trip to BurGR.  Unfortunately the service while seated alone at the bar left something to be desired. This might not be an issue if you arrive and are seated at a table or come in a bigger party, but the length of time from sitting down to being approached for a drink order and the time from finishing my food/beverage to receiving a check was more than I've experienced anywhere else in Las Vegas.  The time from putting my order in until the food arrived was very reasonable, and the restaurant was busy. The view you get of the kitchen from the bar was terrific as well.  Next time I'm in Vegas I'll just call ahead and see if I can't place an order for pickup."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome! Had the burger and it was definitely the best burger I've ever had. The fries...OMGAH the fries were the best especially with the sauce. I will never forget this place."}
{"text":"As a longtime fan of Gordon, I was quite interested to try this place out.  I was fairly disappointed with my experience here.  Perhaps it's because we came at 11pm, but the host and server both seemed irritable and waiting to get off the clock.  Despite there being probably only 15% capacity at the time, we waited more than 10 minutes for our beers, before asking the server when they were coming.  I may have misinterpreted but it seemed like that was when she remembered to follow up on the beers.  The Hell's Kitchen burger was good but there was so much going on in the burger, it felt almost too busy!  A good burger nonetheless.  My biggest disappointment with the night was the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Unless I dipped them in the truffle aioli sauce, I couldn't actually taste any truffle flavor at all.  The fries just seemed like normal thick cut fries with a little parmesan sprinkled on top.  I was looking forward to something more like the fries at Umami Burger (in terms of truffle flavor presence).  The decor was nice and it definitely had a pretty cool vibe with the place.  The seats were pretty low but perhaps that's because I'm not-so-tall 5'7\".  Considering the price as well, I will not be inclined to revisit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Definitely a good place to visit if you're craving a good burger. The Hell's Kitchen burger and Britannia burger are favorites along with Parmesan fries. Wait can be bit a long during dinner. Even Togo was 45 min. Quite a long walk from parking garage."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 5pm and didn't have to wait. Really enjoyed the burgers, but especially enjoyed the truffle Parmesan fries - I wish I could get myself another order right now! Service was adequate, but not great as we sat with empty drink glasses for the last half of our meal. Oh well, it was her higher tip percentage to lose. The ipad drink menu was apparently \"down\" when we arrived so I have no idea what they had there, but another option to read a drink menu would've been nice. Just had iced teas instead. Interestingly, the table next to us sat down less than 5 minutes after us and they got the drink menu. But regardless of those service faults, the food is what mattered to us and it was very tasty. And the sticky toffee pudding push pops for dessert? I'd love another one right now (after I eat more fries!)."}
{"text":"Not that impressed. Clearly as you can see. The service in an off peak hour at 4 PM although fully staffed was less then desirable. I had a variety of appetizers. 1 not all consistently tasty within the plate itself. As though 2 batches of food were used with very different seasonings. Burnt edges on the pastry portion and not in a good way, however the sauces for dipping were in fact very good. My daughter had burger. Figured that should be amazing for the $$$$ hefty price. I would say it was good but not amazing. This guy needs to take in some of the advise he is always dishing out. This is truly not good enough to stand on the line even if Gordon was serving you the dish himself. Many other eateries in Vegas will thrill you so spend your time and money wisely and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was a 2 actually expected a lot better burgers were great but really pricey everything ala carte and fries were good but need a couple orders as they lack in quantity might go back if I will a jackpot"}
{"text":"A mediocre burger joint. If I would go back to  Vegas and eat at one of GR's restaurants, I would go back to the pub at ceasars or the steakhouse in paris instead of this one. I find the staff here a bunch of snobs. The fries aren't even the best. The shakes are too thick to drink out of the straw. Just a little disappointed."}
{"text":"Everyone I come to Vegas this is a required stop for me & the bf. It's not just the food or the cool ambiance, even though there is large amounts of both. The best part about eating here is the excellent service. We've been here several times & have been helped by different servers every time. Our service has been flawless every time. Quick drinks & attentive service really help make this a great experience.   Please don't think it's just about the service though. I sometimes have dreams about the yumminess of the Farm Burger (my go to order). The jalapeño poppers are fantastic & the sides (fries/onion rings) are excellent. If you come here at lunchtime be prepared for a wait (there's a line outside the restaurant). You'll get seated faster coming in the late afternoon between normal lunch/dinner hours.   This is completely worth your time & is the most affordable of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in Vegas. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We came here last year once and it was fantastic. My husband and I always order burgers to be well done at any restaurant, so we know what well done is. We had a great well done burger last year here, no pink, no blood, still juicy and not burnt. And then tonight, we went there again, hope to have the same quality. Oh boy, seems like the chef lost his touch tonight. My husband's came out as black (I regret that I didn't take a picture to show the public how black it was, it was unsightful), and mine was still pink at least for a quarter of the patty. If a customer asks for well done, you should give them well done on the whole patty, not to leave 1 quarter to be underdone, and not to overcook or over-char it to pitch black. It's full black on one side of my husband's beef patty. It was really bad, as if the chef didn't have any heart or passion in making a good well done burger. And I really don't know if they changed the chef too....maybe it was a different person last year? We weren't upset yet at that point, because we understand that mistakes can happen. So I told the waitress about the issue. You know what she said at first? she said mine looked pretty well done to her! Well done means there is no pink! If a quarter of the patty is still pink, it's not a full well done! It was a half-assed job! How dare she! And then she said my husband's patty is black because that's how fire grill is. We were really upset at hearing her saying that because this restaurant is not the only restaurant offering fire grill burger or even steak in this town, and we've been to other places and none of them would give such response or attitude. She totally doesn't know what owning up mistakes is. And I am very sure that the pitch black side wouldn't be accepted by any customer or even any chef who at least would have some dignity. So I told her that I am sure a chef is capable to deliver a burger well done without burnt. And I had it perfect last year, that means it's do-able. So she took our plates (also took our silverware without giving us new ones) and said she would ask what the kitchen could do about it. There was no apology at all from her. It's like we were asking for too much. She didn't even understand that it was the kitchen making a mistake in performance and quality. It's so ridiculous.  So our new burgers came out again, this time they are fully well done without hideous burnt, but not as juicy as the one we had last year. We didn't complain about lack of juiciness and just finished them because we were hungry. I also want to note that when we went last year, it was way busier than how it was tonight. So there shouldn't be any excuse on the mishap. I just really wish that people would own up to their mistakes and apologize, because that's the only way you can improve, that's called good work ethics. Don't make it as the customers' problem. According to our experience, a lot of other restaurants we've been to would apologize right away when we pointed out the problem, and the managers would come out personally (without us asking) to apologize as well. And we always go back if they are willing to fix problems and own up to the mistakes. But this time, we don't feel that we want to come back to BurGR because of this incident. To be fair, I am gonna tell you that we did ask for the manager to discuss this issue after we finished dining and paid. The manager apologized, and said he would talk to that specific waitress who served us. And while the manager was apologizing, we saw that the waitress was having an unhappy look at us and talking to her co-worker next to the kitchen. We were thinking \"this person really needs to learn manners and grow up\". I don't understand why people in this era can't take constructive criticism anymore, do a half-assed job, but still expect to have no trouble, no complaint, or even full tip. We didn't give her tip, you can judge us all you want. We just don't want to endorse such bad work ethics in this world. People need to really work hard with a mature attitude and good work ethics before expecting a reward. We are plain upset.  Besides, the manager suggested us that maybe we could request to have the burger to be grilled on the cooler side of the grill so it won't get pitch black next time. I didn't even want to go too deep with him on this topic and just requested him to educate his staff to handle this kind of issue better next time. Honestly, I don't think any restaurant or chef should expect the customers to specifically tell them not to put a well done order on the hot side of the grill. Anyone who hasn't gone to a culinary school but has a grill at their backyard should know this knowledge. If you want the customer to tell you specifically how to cook the burger, you shouldn't even pride yourself to be a chef, or even a chef in a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant. This whole experience is disappointing, and food quality and service were below par. It's our second & last visit to BurGR."}
{"text":"I'm a Gordon Ramsay fanboy so his BurGR (Planet Hollywood) and Steak (The Paris) restaurants were at the top of my list. While the latter didn't pan out (asking people to drop $100+ each on a meal isn't easy), the former did.   We stopped in on a Friday night and the place was rammed. We saw a huge line up but weren't sure what to make of it. The lovely hostess informed me there would be an hour and a half wait. I haven't heard those words in a long time in terms of getting a seat at a restaurant and initially balked. However, they offered a texting service for when your table was ready. EVERY RESTAURANT NEEDS TO DO THIS! I don't want a buzzer that had a range of 10 feet. Send me a text. My face is buried in my phone anyway. The three of us hit another bar for drinks, my phone went off an hour later and we were set. No excess waiting around.  Roasted Jalapeno Poppers - $12 I wasn't sure what to make of $12 Jalapeno Poppers. You typically have this idea in your mind of a slice of Jalapeno, dumped in low grade Cream Cheese and fried in some generic batter. These were anything but that. First of all, each of these Poppers was a BEAST! It's not just what's atop the Cheddar Ranch dipping sauce. They're submerged in the shot glasses. The Jalapenos were covered in Bacon and Cheddar Cheese, battered, coated and fried. Every bite had a great crunch before bursting with the Pepper/Cheese/Bacon combination. These have ruined me from all other Jalapeno Poppers.  Hell's Kitchen Burger - $14 It's essentially their Spicy Burger, though the elements seemed strange. With the exception of roasted Jalapenos, there wasn't anything \"spicy\" about it. I'm surprised there wasn't anything like Horseradish Sauce or a spiced Mayo thrown into the mix. The Peppers were even cooled by Avocado. Props for using Asadero Cheese. Usually you'd find that in Quesadillas or Burritos down south. If anything I'd call this a Mexican Burger before \"Hell's Kitchen.\" While the toppings were fine, the patty was spot on. The burgers are grilled a lightly seasoned, perfect Medium Rare. The bun was well toasted (maybe a hair too much) and brought it all together.   Just Fries - $8 I believe \"UGH\" applies here. For a place with such exceptional food, it's shocking how piss poor these Fries were. The temperature was lukewarm at best. There was no sense of crispness. The potatoes themselves were limp. The only saving grace was the Curry & Chipotle Ketchup respectively. A little research from other reviews shared my sentiment so it's not like we just got a bad batch. Gordon Ramsay BurGR simply sells AWFUL Fries. I think it's made all the worse knowing these terrible Fries are $8. Do NOT order these.  Farm Burger - $15 I used to be adamantly against Yolk. I still won't eat a runny Egg with my breakfast. However, I've come to appreciate the elevation it brings to other dishes. Case in point, the Farm Burger. I mulled it over for days after eating this, but right now I'd call this the best Burger I've ever eaten. Everything just came together so well. The patty was spot on. The Duck Breast Bacon (I didn't even know that was a thing) was flavourful and crispy. You really got a strong sense of Bacon in every bite. The English Sharp Cheddar was nice though it didn't bring that knockout punch I expect from sharp Cheddar. The Egg was the key though. My God why haven't I been eating Eggs on every Burger since the beginning of my life? The whites were firm and the Yolk was just consistent enough that it didn't explode all over the place. I was over the moon with this Burger and it likely showed on my face. I gave serious consideration to ordering another one but was too blown up. A sharper sense of Cheddar and this would have been perfect as opposed to you know... my favourite.  If you're looking for a damn good Burger, then Gordon Ramsay BurGR is your spot. Fries aside (again DON'T ORDER THEM!) everything else lived up to the standard I was expecting."}
{"text":"The wait was long. I didn't care for my burger I ordered the Euro. The other two burgers Hells kitchen and American were good. Beer was excellent. It's cool but kinda pricey."}
{"text":"The queue outside and empty tables a plenty inside should have been a warning sign. Great concept, being in the land of burgers and all, oh and mixing in a celebrity chef. Unfortunately, it does not work here. I've eaten many a burger in my time and this was by far the most long winded and protracted way to get an average burger I've ever had, plus the service was a let down. We were left waiting along with a queue of up to 30 people while seats lay empty inside ( waiting staff hung around for customers to be seated- my bug bear is this waiting to be seated rigmarole). Our waitress was charming but a little distracted. We needed to request to be served by another waiter. I ordered a well done burger, it was medium rare! Ok ok but to some that's undercooked. Our waitress kept asking were our ciders nice. We only had beer. So to summarise this is a place to be seen but in my experience bit of a let down."}
{"text":"Came in on a Monday, July 20th at 3:45 pm. Was a 5 or so minute wait to get our seats. Hillary our server came over after about 7 minutes and took our drink and food order together. Waters took 8 minutes to arrive and we had to bug the hostess to grab them! My napkin was dirty with my silverware inside it. Dirty as in crusted food and spots all over it. Spots on girlfriends napkin also. Ordered the American burger($14) and girl had Caesar salad. Food didn't arrive till 4:25 -- forty minutes after we ordered!!!Burger was tasty but honestly nothing to right home about. Girl enjoyed her hefty salad. After finished waitress came over to ask if things were ok. My plate was empty and she doesn't take it away. Perhaps I'm a princess but.. Gordon would be upset :("}
{"text":"HUGE burgers and fabulous jalapeño poppers!!!  Now I can say I've been to s Gordon Ramsey restaurant without breaking the bank. Would definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"Besides the extremely long line to get in (and they had several open tables when we finally sat down)... The food was excellent. I had the Hell's Kitchen turkey burger... The bun was fluffy just how I like it, excellent sauce and the turkey was amazing. We had the onion rings and 'just fries' and they were also delicious. Service was great, and didn't wait long for food. They had a 4th of July vodka push pop and that was the icing on the cake of a good meal. Would definitely recommend and it was reasonably priced. They are also tech savvy and had their desert menu on iPads and you can take a survey when you pay on an iPhone.. Kinda cool!"}
{"text":"I chose this place based on the Yelp reviews, but I was disappointed. It was very expensive for what we got (nearly $60 meal for 2 medium-sized burgers, 1 order of fries and 2 waters). Being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, I expected it to be good.   First, there were a number of amateurish flaws. One, the chairs are designed in a way so that you sit quite close to the floor and feel like the table is up at your chin. You feel sort of like you are sitting in chairs designed for a preschool classroom. That way when the waitress takes your order, she seems like a giant.   Two, there are a lot of problems with the fries. First, they come in a holder that is attractive but poorly designed, with the fries in a cone in the center and sauces (amazingly good housemade mayo (aioli!) and ketchup) on either side.   Because of the small tabletop, the holder has to be placed along the edge of the table. If you turn it sideways and put it in the middle, then one person (at a 2-person table) cannot reach the fries because the back of the cone is taller than the front. So, you leave it on the edge of the table.   Because of this, you cannot reach the sauce on the other person's side, and you cannot take them out because they are jammed into the holder and won't budge. Not such a big deal for the ketchup - dip the fries and the ketchup sticks, though it's hard to reach. Bigger deal for the mayo. Dip the fries in that and they come out clean. The only way to get to that mayo is to use your knife and reach over the floor (not the table or you will knock the fries off!) and hope it doesn't fall off your knife ... onto the floor.   Second, the parmesan fries were very poorly designed because the parmesan just falls right off of the fries. It is impossible to get it to stick. The parmesan itself tasted amazing, but you basically had to eat it separately, and it all fell to the bottom of the cone they were served in, so you had to eat the fries first, then dump out the parmesan at the end and try in vain to pick some of it up to eat it. Of course, you can use the mayo to glue the parmesan onto each fry by hand. :-)   My last complaint is that my burger (Britannia Burger) had barely any sauce on it. It was pretty dry. It was supposed to have mango chutney, and I did notice something yellowish-orange, but only because I was looking for it because I knew it was supposed to be there. Again, mayo (aioli!) to the rescue!  That said, the quality of the food was good. Everything tasted good and it's clear they use good-quality ingredients. But, I wouldn't choose it again."}
{"text":"Get the:  -Skinny Screw -Brittania Burger -Fries, can't go wrong with either truffle oil or chipotle/curry ketchup.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Get here early. There was a line before opening at 11am.   That being said it's a bit pricey for a burger but worth it. The wings were great, I am from Buffalo so I have grown up with wings. Ask for them extra crispy. The only draw back was it didn't come with a dipping sauce.  The three cheese burger was awesome, the loaded fries were great and the push ups were a great ending. I recommend getting either an alcoholic root beer or non and have it with the push pops. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tried Burgr for the first time and true to Chef Ramsey's culinary wizardry as displayed on his TV show when helping turn around failing businesses, the meal was prepared and presented excellently.  Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger medium well with the Truffle Fries, my wife had the Euro burger medium well with a side salad. Meat seasoned very well and cooked to order with just the right hint of pink.  Fries and salad both fresh and excellently seasoned.  Food presentation a plus!  Staff very friendly and prompt.  Definite repeat."}
{"text":"The BurGR is a beautifully set out restaurant and full of lots of sharp-looking waitstaff, and despite a lengthy line for group-dining, as a single I was able to sit right down at the bar.  I ordered one of the special burger offereings, the uber cheeseburger medium well.  I think of burger-medium well as \"no pink in the middle,\" or passably the tiniest bit of pink in the middle as ground beef should be cooked much more thoroughly than, say, a beef steak.  Many restaurants will not even have a medium-rare burger as an option owing to the chance of food poisoning from undercooked hamburgers.  When the burger arrived 25 minutes later, it looked gorgeous on its puffy roll, with the cheese nicely melted and the beef sporting a glazed, glistening look.  But the first bite into the burger crushed my enthusiasm.  If the burger was 1/2 inch thick, then the middle 1/4 inch all the way through the burger was pink.  2 days later I am comfortable stating that the burger did not make me sick, but for a guy's whose reputation is built on quality control, how he let this burger come out of his kitchen so underdone is a mystery.  I'll be curious to see what other reports come out of this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a Ramsay fan on TV.  Always fascinated to watch him put food together and how he's passionate about making it.  This has, honestly, influenced me to cook for myself and put effort in to it, selecting better, fresher ingredients and cooking proper meals, compared to what I used to put in my stomach.  Bottom line, this is a guy on TV talking about having the highest standards.  So, when I walk into one of his restaurants, I really expect the highest quality.  Ever.  To be blown away.  I wasn't.  I went in last week with my wife and best friend.  The place is very well designed, Ramsay's face everywhere almost to the point you expect the plates to have him on, too, and a gift shop by the exit where you can buy Ramsay dolls.  Just saying, Gordon, I know it's a cash in on the TV fame and building the brand but don't take it any further or it will be self-worship.  Waitress was nice, peppy, all the girls working there were young good looking fillies, personally selected by GR?  It was booming with people, we waited about ten minutes and they texted us to come in.  Menu is small, simple.  We ordered the Stuffed Jalapeno shooters.  They were lightly battered, stuffed with cheese, nice but a little dry.  I did not like the fact that they told me they didn't know which one of the shooters contained the part with all the hot seeds.  That might be dangerous for certain people, I would think.    My Mrs ordered a Fish & Chips burger, which was essentially a fried piece of cod stuck in a sub roll.  No garnish, just slapped in.  I thought that was uninspired.  Something you could make yourself at home (we have).  We ordered the garlic aioli fries.  I thought there was a little too much garlic on there, the sauces were okay.  Again, I was really unimpressed.  And it did take about 25 minutes for the Jalapeno Poppers to show up, then another 15 minutes for the burgers after that.  So I got the Hell's Kitchen burger.  I asked for medium, which I know Ramsay has a big thing about getting right and so he should.  I thought that of all places I would get a perfectly cooked burger, it would be here.  Wrong.  The burger was burnt on the outside.  Burnt.  Not \"charred\", I know the difference.  The  inside was more well than medium and not medium well.  The burger was dry and flavourless.  That burnt outside was all I could taste and it just ruined it for me.  It was garnished with (I think) sun roasted tomato and one other item, certainly not dressed the way you would normally expect.  That was fine, it was the \"gourmet effort.  But, you know what?  It just didn't work for me.  It was all so \"bleh\".    My mrs liked her Fish & Chip sandwich.  My friend was not impressed with his burger, either.  We like burgers.  I make my own at home.  I'm not a chef, I have no stake in the restaurant business.  I just like well made food that's been made with some passion and care to attention.  burGR did neither for me.  So, back to the service, which had started off pretty well.  Our server was switched after 20 minutes to someone else who popped by once.  She came back 15 minutes after the burgers had been delivered, which is waaaay too long to come and do that quick check and make sure everyone got what they wanted.  So by this point, my burger was cold.  I told her about the burn and she walked away without resolving it.  20 minutes later, we were sat there pissed off and increasingly irritated.  Finally, she came back, we asked for the bill and she asked me if I wanted the burger \"refiring\".  No, the last thing this bloody burger needed was throwing back under the grill.  She then told me it would take \"three minutes\" to get back to the table.  Oh, really?  After we sat here for the best part of 30 minutes waiting for it in the first place?  That was the last straw for me.  Bad food, bad service, way overpriced.  I can't imagine Mr Ramsay allowing such low level quality to happen in his restaurant.  I'd rate the food one to two stars, the place gets one solid star for being super clean.  Food wasn't disgusting, just badly cooked and I hate passionless cooking.  It's a slap in the face to paying customers, especially people lured in by the Ramsay brand of making top notch food.  Not worth the money or the trip.  We dined at another burger joint, KGB Burger at the Harrah's the night before.  That was cooked perfectly- medium- was delicious, staff were great.  Just the polar opposite of what we experienced in burGR.  If you want a Vegas Ramsay experience, I'd suggest going to Steak at the Paris.   Avoid burGR.  It's a gimmick, it's expensive and you can get way better burgers in Vegas.    Mr Ramsay, please raise the standards.  I'd be happy to cook one of mine for you instead, sir:)"}
{"text":"Service was bad and really slow. No one really came to check on us and it took forever for our check to come out. The food wasn't even that good. The burgers were really dry. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it wasn't worth the $15. The Shake #4 was pretty good though. That's it. Everything else was bad. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We were passing by and I saw the restaurant. As we know him from the TV show as a very good chef we decided to stop. We loved!!! Honestly, one of the best burgers I've had in my life. I had the Pork hamburger and was fenomenal. I'd definitely came back for another bite of anything on menu."}
{"text":"This was one of my top 3 burgers I've had the pleasure of eating. The goat cheese, arugula and toasty bun perfectly melded with the burger to create heaven in my mouth. Garlic truffle fries have changed my life but no where else can even come close to making them as well as Burgr. The ambiance is so cool, the glass fire wall is mesmerizing and the menu is unique, usually they just look like a book or flyer. Service was excellent and we even met Christina, hells kitchen winner. I'll be back even if it was pricey, it's worth the experience."}
{"text":"Not at all like Gordon's other two places in Las Vegas ... Wait staff had cute outfits and super smiles however, were not able to follow through with service ... simply not attentive.  Food was not Gordon Ramsey ... What happened with Gordon ? We are your biggest fans however, this venue needs different management ...  Salads were sad ... Burger was tiny and lifeless on the plate ... Truffle fries were cold ... drinks arrived one at a time and there were four of us  ... a mini parade LOL hmmm.... you might want to do a makeover on this one !  We Love Love Love  your other two houses !!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers at BurGR are amazing. I had the \"farm\" burger - English sharp cheddar, duck breast bacon with an egg on top, really? Absolutely delicious. Don't order too much, the burgers are quite large. Service is wonderful too. Will definitely return for more whenever we have a chance."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've ever had. Excellent, combinations that are just enough outside of the norm. The sweet potato fries are to die for. They come with a vanilla sugar powder and mustard sauce. I've been there so many times and the price is right! You can feed 2 people on one order of fries so keep that in mind too. Great place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today and tried the American Burger and \"Just Fries\".  The wait time for a couple of burgers far exceeded our expectation, which a Manager responded to promptly. The burgers and fries were Ok, nothing spectacular given the Gordon Ramsey theme.   Since our meal was a flop, the manager covered our meal and solicited feedback from us on where they missed the mark with us. This restaurant appears to have a very keen management staff, I just hope they can translate customer feedback into a better product."}
{"text":"Some restaurants in life are worth the hour-and-a-half line wait. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is not one of them. The food was good, but the service was lacking.   My wife and I waited for an hour and a half in line before we were seated. The frustrating part is that once we settled in there was on average 4 empty tables around us the entire time we were dining (it took us less than an hour for a starter and main - we declined dessert because sharing a starter and main was already enough food). During this period there was a lingering line at the door...  Additionally we had to basically beg for some water before a server started pouring for us (drought notwithstanding, they could have at least asked if we would like some water instead of automatically pouring to save water). This would not have such an issue had the waiter been accessible to us - I almost had to shout across the restaurant as waiters and waitresses scurried through the sparsely filled restaurant.  All of this detracts from the \"foodie\" experience, which is a pity since the food wasn't that bad. One tip: if you're not accustomed to eating truffles, don't get the truffle and parmesan fries, it's way too overpowering."}
{"text":"Possibly the best burgers we've ever had, and the parmesan fries with truffle aioli are to die for. There was a wait even though we were here at 4:30 on a Monday, and I can understand why."}
{"text":"There's usually a line at mealtimes outside, but don't be dissuaded, it's worth the wait!   The gourmet twists on tried and true favourites (hamburgers, hotdogs, fries, shakes) adds fun and pizzaz to the dining experience.   If you have a sweet tooth, save room for a milkshake as dessert. The shakes are a combo of pudding, shake and cookie - over the top and delicious!   The truffle fries were well balanced and unless you love sweet things, perhaps give the sweet potato fries a miss.   The place also utilises iPads to show (read: sell) you their drinks (cocktails especially!) Nifty and temptation-driving, perhaps having a flick through will help you work out what milkshake you'd like to try the most ;)"}
{"text":"BurGR is located in the heart of the Planet Hollywood casino; one of the worst places for a local to access next to maybe anything inside of Caesar's Palace in my book. You have to travel through a full side of the shops and the casino to get to the restaurant which is adjacent to one of the entries off the Strip. Since it had been open barely a week, and also the weekend right before New Year's, I figured it might be best to make a reservation and called the number on their website. After 4 failed phone calls to either clueless Caesar's employees not knowing that this new restaurant existed, or being transferred to lines that went to defunct voicemail boxes, I gave up and took a chance walking in. We arrived to a 35+ minute wait for two, with plenty of larger groups waiting at the front. Luckily there was absolutely no one sitting at the bar so we took our chances there. The entry has a pretty large fire feature wall, which at the time of my visit still wasn't functioning. There is a fairly plain bar that seats about 15 right at the front, with a very open almost cafeteria-like layout of booths and tables. A pretty cool wavy ceiling swoops through most of the space, only broken up by a flat ceiling centered in front of the display kitchen.  The menu is fairly simple, and really focuses on the restaurant's namesake: burgers. There are a few interesting sounding appetizers, salads and some tasty shakes from what I've heard. According to their website the burgers are cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods, the only burger joint of its kind on the Strip. More about that in a second. What is nice to see is that the menu does offer I believe 11 different kinds of pre-designed burger options; I've been to far too many celebrity burger joints on the Strip and found maybe 3 choices on their menu. With this many choices, unless the burger was going to be completely awful I figured I'd have to come back and try one of their more adventurous double stacked burgers that come with a regular patty in addition to another kind of meat.   So with this round I went with the slightly more neutral chanterelle burger: chanterelle mushrooms, arugula and figgy-onion jam. What arrived was a perfectly formed burger on an equal sized, perfectly proportioned bun. For some reason I really wanted to hate this meal coming into it, but I was fairly impressed with it upon first bite; the meat was very good quality, and had really good char flavor around the edges that actually made us think back to our last savored bites of a Bachi burger. But that wood-fueled flavor? Not sure that was it. It was cooked close to the medium rare I had ordered, with some pink throughout but really lacking any sort of juices. The chanterelle mushrooms had really good flavor and were proportioned well, and the arugula was a good touch. I forgot all about the figgy-onion jam until after I had finished the burger; apparently either they did too or it just wasn't flavorful enough to stand out. Although the bun was sized perfectly, I found it to be very dry and inconsistent, with some overly buttery bites showing up at welcomed moments. Overall it was a very solid burger. My girlfriend actually compared its overall level of perfection in composition and flavor to the consistency of Bachi, which I understand but don't completely agree with. While I did find the meat to be pretty savory, it's just not on the same level. And Bachi's buns? Forget it; the BurGR ones don't come close.  What was a huge letdown for this meal was how awful the fries were; thin, hollow and completely overcooked. We went with the plain fries over the truffle parmesan or sweet potato in order to sample the basics of what are offered, and maybe that was a mistake. Both the curry and chipotle ketchups that accompany the regular fries are good, maybe the chipotle not as much, but neither flavors really go together or make sense with the burgers we ordered. And they were literally so hard and overcooked that my jaw was almost sore from eating them. Having the perfect fries may have changed my overall perception of this meal a bit, as this is a major gripe of mine.  I think $16 for just the burger is also a little high, even being in a Strip location. If one is to truly compare the composed perfection to a Bachi burger, which I feel there is just no comparison to that burger, you can get far more for $9. And $8 for our plain fries is insanely high; I'm not sure I would ever consider spending $11 for their truffle parmesan or $9 for the sweet potato fries after sampling these. If you're obsessed with Ramsay, or the whole celebrity chef thing, then you'll probably be impressed with the quality of this burger, as many folks on Yelp seem to be right now. But if you're looking for simply a fantastic burger, there are far better options on the Strip in better locations, and plenty more throughout the city for a far better price."}
{"text":"Great burgers!!!! That should be enough to say but for details lets just say the goat and the blue cheeses are to die for and the truffle fries are delicious.  I had my hell kitchen burger medium well and it was spot on! Juicy and tender  My wife had the euro burger medium well and it wasn't as juicy as mine but still delicious.  The regular fries are good but go with the truffle ones. They taste better.  I also had a good IPA beer draft... Can't go wrong there.  Almost forgot the appetizers; the wings are tender and not too hot. They come with carrots and Boise cheese crumbles."}
{"text":"Excellent place to go for a burger, a bit expense but hey its Vegas so fits in with everywhere else.  The service was top notch, sometimes it is the little things like the waiter noticing we had spilled sauce on a coaster so he replaced it.  Remembering a previous conversation where we were asking about the truffle fries (excellent).  My wife and I also ordered the onion rings, the euro burger and the hell's kitchen burger.  All great.  The only thing I would not get again would be the pudding milkshake.  It tasted good but seemed like cold pudding instead of milkshake, so if you like pudding then this would be for you."}
{"text":"Huge wine pour! Fabulous burger! Get there early for lunch. Gordon is a prick on tv but he knows how to run a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Tasty burger, the bread is def a big plus point, a bit crispy outside. High quality meat and amazing sauce. Recommend order onion rings and eat the burger with a bit of their truffle sauce."}
{"text":"A-OK sounds about right.  I ordered the American Burger - meat, cheese, onions, pickles, lettuce + tomatoes. I did ask for it without some of these things as I am a picky eater. The burger was really good and very flavourful. Buns were fresh and cheese was delicious.   We split one order of the truffle fries between the 4 of us along with our burgers and it was definitely enough.  Sort of pricey (menu pictures here seem to abound), but definitely glad I finally gave this place a visit."}
{"text":"Went here roughly two years ago and it was pretty good. I love \"Kitchen Nightmares\" and Gordon Ramsay and was delighted to try this out. If you are interested, check out his restaurant in Caesars Palace which is also delicious."}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant experience here today.  There were four of us and our food was amazing.  Shake #4 is to die for.  My only issue was with the truffle fries. They were a little too over powering and would have been better with a more subtle flavor.  I will definitely be coming back.  Our server was also amazing and the customer service is the best ice experienced in the city!"}
{"text":"The people writing bad reviews are either food critics, food snobs, or they have a different staff now.  We just got done eating here about 45 minutes ago. This was my observations:  Greeter/hostess at the front desk was nice and pleasant and gave us a menu to look at in line. Was told it would be about 15-20 minutes for my husband and I to be seated. I'd say they were accurate and we didn't wait more than 15 minutes.  I'm assuming it's a rule to be a very skinny girl, or a buff, well groomed man. Which it was GR's decision to have them hire the look he wants so that's respected. The males looked great, very handsome, nice, and young. The female (hostesses) looked trampy, like they were representing NASCAR for Budweiser. The female servers looked very blah.  Our first waiter, Alex, was awesome! A little over-the-top friendly but I always appreciate that. He gave great recommendations! He had to leave shortly after our drink order and we got a different server, Danielle, Amanda, or maybe Sarah?... That shows how personable she was. Didn't care that we were there and hardly checked on us. We tried to tip the busboy because he was fantastic. Very prompt and polite, but he didn't come back  once we had a tip ready :(  Now to the food! My husband got a Hell's Kitchen burger and I got a Farm burger. Mine was AMAZING! I've never had an egg on a burger and it was delicious. My husband says his was very good, perfectly cooked (mine was too) and both were perfectly seasoned. The parmesan truffle fries were okay/good. They were heavy on the parmesan which wasn't needed but the fries were awesome and not greasy at all. The 2 sauces were okay, but one had an aftertaste of a nail salon and the other tasted like the sauce from Chef-Boyardee ravioli sauce.   Bonus observation: the tables are too high for how short the chairs are, it was awkward.   Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"The burgers were amazing. Cooked perfectly! Unfortunately they sat us right under the ac which they had on very high, and it made our burgers cold quickly. :( But everything else was better than expected."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with all the hype of GB, but that was the draw for us and we got to bypass the long line with our prayers card.  After we got yelled at from the waitor for not listening to his menu rap we ordered farm burgers- burger with duck bacon and a fried egg!  Delicious cooked the way we ordered it.  Nice dripping oozing burger, priced fairly despite the celebrity chef( have been to Hubertus Keller burger bar and way more expensive and not that good ). If you are in the mood for a good  burger by a celebrity chef on the Las Vegas Strip this place is good!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing went on firday nigth we waited for one hour to get inside the good thing they text you when they are ready for you come back i had the hells kitchen burger and it was amazing and sweet potatoes fries Yum"}
{"text":"Definitely lived up to the hype!!!  I absolutely loved my burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger...DELICIOUS!!  Although everything was pretty much electronic, we had a very attentive server, and our food came out in a decent amount of time...nice and fresh!! My next trip to Vegas, I will return :o)"}
{"text":"This is such a cool restaurant!  First time here and the food was so good!  The service and the waitress we had was great too!  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone!  So cool to Be at too"}
{"text":"The best burger, fries, and shake I've ever had.  What a wonderful find!  I would go bag to Vegas just for this burger!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by GR yesterday for dinner, I can resume all I want to say in a few words, this place in out of this world! It's a must, came regardless of a few negative reviews posted, food ( burgers) are amazing, quality is A+ and the service is excellent, if you stop by ask for Jered, his service goes beyond excellent , he came to check if there was anything else we need it very regularly. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's going on at my favorite burger joint. I hope Gordon reads his reviews bc honestly I'm disappointed with the quality of food I've received the last few times I've been in.  The service has always been hit or miss, but the food was always spot on. Now??? The kitchen was chaotic, orders backed up. Took forever to get our order. The exact opposite of what I'm used to here, and what Gordon preaches on Kitchen Nightmares. And where's Christina? She leaves & the place goes downhill!!  My recent visit found me ordering my fave: fish burger.  The first time I had this burger, I received a whole cod that spilled out of the bun. THIS visit my burger consisted of two fish fingers that were so small I sat there gobsmacked, questioning what I'd received. It was more like fish sticks. I ditched the bun & ate my sticks.   The truffle fries were very truffle-y. I didn't like them.   I hope, oh do I hope, GR hasn't allowed Planet Hollywood to sacrifice quality of ingredients for cost. I hope this is a one off. If it's not, I'll have to find another burger joint to love bc I won't go back if this is the case."}
{"text":"First off, the line was very long. It seems like this place is always packed so I figured My gf and I would commit to waiting 35 min. When we were finally seated we asked to sit at the bar(thinking faster service). I ordered a Guinness beer and the bartender poured it, but forgot to bring it to me. So it took her 10 min to pour me a beer. Anyways, we place our orders and I chose the American burger and added duck bacon. I ordered fries too. FYI the fries are sold separate and are a good enough portion to split between 2 people. The burger was cooked to medium like I asked. The only problem is that it took over 30 min to receive our food. All in all the burger was good....but not great. Not enough for me to wait in line again or anything like that. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Overall: The service is absolutely atrocious and the food is good. Prepare for $35-40/person for a burger, fries and drink.  We really looked forward to Burgr, and if you are a fan of Ramsay's you will notice the menu follows his ideas. It is simple, small and straight-forward.  They try to incorporate technology as they have iPad's for the drink/dessert menu and at the end of the meal provide a survey that you use an iPod for.  Overall, there was a nice selection of beers on tap. The food was good, not the greatest burger I have ever had, but it was definitely a good burger. The Parmesan Fries were pretty good too.  Most couples split an order of fries.  What ruins the food though is the horrible service. The servers seem only interested in bringing your food and not seeing if you are doing fine. While we were eating out meal, our server interupted us to ask if we wanted dessert before we were even done our food.  Then, while still eating our food (after turning down dessert) our bill was tossed onto the table.  Usually these sort of restaurants in Vegas have great service, service that makes you forget about having to wait for your food. But the horrible service took away from the entire experience.   I cannot recommend this restaurant. While the food is good, it is no better than many other places in Vegas and definitely no cheaper. But the service is absolutely horrible compared to them,and why put up with horrible service when you have many other choices?"}
{"text":"Really delicious burgers, and not too long of a wait for a table on a Thursday night. The fries were good, but nothing special (we just ordered the classic fries). I would try one of the specialty fries if we go back some day. Service was friendly, but I thought it was strange that part of the menu was on an ipad. This is a great place to come for a bite after a show!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are very very good. The fries and onion rings unbelievable . They give you a variety of sauces with them. Everything I've had here is good. Love the Hellskitchen burger."}
{"text":"How disappointing. Not in the food necessarily- but in the experience. I left feeling bitter and a bit angry. The customer service had been terrible from the onset, with the worst being at the end.  We're standing in line and as we make it to the front we find ourselves being completely ignored because the hostesses have decided to compare nails and chat. Then after we get seated, the guy coming over to explain the drinks and get is situated was very friendly and we felt better and looked forward to our burgers. But then it turns out we had a different waitress who didn't greet us or say much of anything really.  So we order our food- I got the Hell's Kitchen- which admittedly tasted very very good. I hate to admit I ordered mine as medium-well ( I know, I know- stop cringing) and it came out a bit bloody. I didn't complain or ask to cook it more because we has already waited a half hour just to get it. So I ate it and it was very yummy, along with the sweet potato fries.  So things were going ok- the waitress was nice enough to let us split our check- so we calculated our meals and have her our cards, only for her to come back with our copies to sign, telling us we still have to pay $6 for the tax. Seriously? She couldn't do that? So fine, we added in extra and that was that. Then the woman who came to fill our waters literally knocked my water glass across the table- shattering in between my friend and I. No I'm sorry, no urgency- we were left trying to move so we didn't get soaked and picked up bits of glass, only for her to come back and lay some extra napkins on our table and leave. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So we're left there trying to pick up all the bits of glass without getting cut. I didn't realize until a bit later that there was a huge shard right behind me- so I picked up and stuck it on the napkin on the table. And the waitress comes back, only to grab the napkin with the glass in it and walk away. No apologies, no checking to see if we're okay. Nothing!!! I couldn't believe it! What kind of crazy service is that? I never complain and I wS actually tempted to, but figured I'd just write a review instead.   So yeah. Food is good, but not worth having to deal with the people working there. Go to Earls Sandwich instead!"}
{"text":"i wish i could give this place a 6, because that chocolate shake and truffle fries i had were simply the GREATEST. THING. EVER. pricey. but hey it's vegas."}
{"text":"For the price I paid I would have expected better.  The burger was pretty underwhelming.  It  was good but not for the price.  The fries that I got also tasted stale like they had been sitting for half the day.  Never going back there again."}
{"text":"Here in Vegas and excited to have lunch at Gordan Ramsays burGR.  Totally met my expectations, I had the maui onion rings and the hell's kitchen burger.  Delicious!  And loved the curry ketchup.  Great and quick service. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful burger. I had the Farm burger and I was allowed to substitute to make it my way. I've never had an egg on a burger before, but I enjoyed the whole experience. Fries came with chipotle and curry ketchup. I would have liked regular ketchup better for the fries but again - it was part of the experience."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this place but unfortunately it was not good. The jalapeños poppers were just ok. I was really disappointed with the ranch it just tasted like bottle ranch with cheddar chunks in it. The jalapeño itself would slide right out after the first bite and all you're left with is the breading and some melted cheddar cheese. The cheese burger was really plain even though it had different cheese in it. The Hell's Kitchen burger was bland even with all the aioli and avacado. Definitely not worth the wait. The onion rings were not good at all. The service was great though."}
{"text":"This place is borderline Garbage. Service/quality/price... I've had way better burgers from hole in the wall crappy burger joints. The fries were like biting into defrosted previously frozen french fries you would get from the grocery store. I guess this is what I should expect when trusting a British Chef to cook a burger. Because it tasted like just about everything I have eaten in London, blah... The price isn't horrible, but if the service is crap, the food is more crap, and you leave feeling like the place is crap. You sure think twice when looking at your bill."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hamburger place that I have ever tried.  I have had In n out and the habit and the counter and burger bar, this one is far superior. First I have eaten here 4 times. The onions are much better than the fries. The burgers are fantastic, cooked to order and flavorful. I prefer no cheese and getting the fried egg. My wife likes the mushroom n fig jam burger.  The hamburgers are excellent, the milkshakes are even better. I highly recommend the #4, the Oreo n creme brûlée shake. I would drive the four hours from my house just for this. It is pricey but awesome, and you will be full. Everyone recommends the toffee pops but I haven't tried them yet. Please try this place, it is better than his pub and his steak restaurant, shocking but true."}
{"text":"This place is OVERHYPED.  I was really excited to try their burgers because from all the pictures (including mine that I took when I went with my boyfriend) all look so delicious.  Our conclusion right when we bit into the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Euro Burger: the meat tasted like Burger King meat patty.  NOTHING SPECIAL. Seriously. And that is our take on that. The bun was good quality though compared to burger king's buns, that's the only difference. Lol  The only thing I really loved was their Parmesan fries and their sweet potato fries were also delicious. The sauces it came with are also delicious.  The only time I'll ever go back to this place is for the Parmesan fries. But I know other restaurants where I can have it.  We won't be back to this place again. It was nice to try once but not again.  We paid $60 with tip included for two burgers and two fries. The most expensive Burger King food I've ever had. If I wanted Burger King patty, I'll just take myself to Burger King."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, Gordon, but your Euro burgr is just bad. It's fresh, it looks good, but it is just not tasty. A fast food one tastes absolutely the same. It isn't supposed to cost over 1,5$, not 15$ as you charge.  Huge dissapointment, seriously. Was your fan, but not any more.  WHAAAAT?!!!!  we were OVERCHARGED +30$$$$ !!!!!!!   HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this gourmet burger hotspot.  We went here on Oct. 27th for dinner and the place was packed and it was only 5:30pm.  Walking up to the place it is quite an impressive site, it has a great vibe.  Even with the long line we were seated fairly quickly. The menu is fairly limited but we came for burgers so that was fine with us.  Our apps came quickly - onion rings and the pork bao buns.  Rings were great and the bao was just ok. I had the Hells Kitchen burger and it was ok.  Meat was bland and slightly undercooked for me.  I like beef on the rarer side but ground beef is kind of mushy when not cooked enough.  Not sure how this gets called the Hells Kitchen burger, there was one small roasted Jalapeno on the burger which I did not find until I was 2/3 of the way through the burger.  A few meager roasted tomatoes that were tasteless did not help.  Bun was fine but overall I just felt the burger was not that exciting.  My wife ordered the Euro burger which was a little better.  However, her burger was really charred on the outside and she ended up having to trim off some of the burger that was a little too black.  I probably would have just eaten it but she is sensitive to this.   We had the truffle fries which were great.  Oreo cookie shake was outstanding. I know of three spots in Santa Barbara the serve a better burger."}
{"text":"Between the fire display as you wait for a table and the elaborate tap system; this place definitely screams \"hip & cool\". I had the \"hells kitchen burger\" which was delicious. The chipotle ketchup is really good as well."}
{"text":"Burger was fair, fries cold. Not Ramsey quality at. He would be throwing the food all over the place. No value for your dollar, too many other options"}
{"text":"Oh Gordon, you should really check out your own restaurants.  I was about to start yelling at your staff for you.....  Husband and I wanted to try out Gordon's burger place.  I mean, his show is \"Kitchen Nightmares\" so this place should be running like a machine, right?  Haha  So we show up probably around 3PM on a Tuesday.  As I walked up to the hostess and greeted her she proceeded to unscrew the cap of her water bottle and take a drink before greeting me.  I did not walk up mid-unscrew or mid-sip, I was standing there and THEN she opened and took a swig.  This is not something I would expect from Gordon's front of the house staff.  Once she greeted us we were promptly brought over to a table  (the place was pretty much empty).    Our server came over and gave us an ipad that listed drinks and desserts.  I ordered a skinny tangerine cocktail, husband had the gin cocktail (I cant remember the actual names but they were off the cocktail menu). It took a bit for us to get them.  Mine was sweet and really pretty much a glass of ice with a little cocktail,  I finished it quickly.  Throughout the meal I had a gin cocktail and husband had another gin cocktail.    We ordered our food and waited.  After about 15 mins our server came over and said \"Your food will be out in a few minutes\".  We were not asking about our food after 15 mins, he offered this info.    We continue to wait.   We saw other people get there food and finish it.  FORTY minutes after we ordered our food arrived. FORTY MINUTES.  For two burgers cooked medium and a side of fries.  And oh yeah, no apologies for the wait.  On minute 30 I was ready to go over to the kitchen and start yelling Gordon Ramsey style, all throwing plates and calling the staff donkeys.  They weren't even busy.  This wait was unacceptable.  Finally got our burgers and fries.  We had the Hells Kitchen Burger, Uber Cheese burger, and Parmesan truffle fries.  The food burgers were very good, not the best ever, but very good.  I liked that they weren't super greasy and were actual cooked medium.  The uber cheese burger was best in the middle of the burger where all the cheeses were mixed together.  The Hells Kitchen burger was good.  Not consistent throughout, different bites had different flavors.  Some was spicy, some wasn't.  Fries were good, by no means mindblowing.  Overall, food was good, wait was unacceptable, skinny cocktail all ice, no booze - oh and all this cost $96 before tip.  If you read my other reviews you will see I am not a stranger to a $100 meal, but this just wasn't worth it.  Wont be making a trip back when I'm in Vegas again.  To break down the 2 stars: Food - 4 stars Wait - 1 star Value for money - 2 stars"}
{"text":"This is what you get when it's just a famous name. This place is not all it is cracked up to be. The food is decent, the service is mediocre. The food took a really long time, we saw our waiter when he took our order and when he brought the check. This is on a Monday at lunch without the weekend crowds. Again, nothing wrong with the food. Just don't expect to be wowed by in any way."}
{"text":"Look.  It's nothing more than a $13-a-burger burger joint. Pretty nice burger. Not the best."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. We had a 30 minute wait to get in then watched everyone else shown the drink menu on the iPads but not us. When we finally ordered everything was fine at that point up until the food came out. They brought our burgers then we had to wait 5 minutes for the fries and onion rings. They forgot the shake so we had to ask for it then the manager brought it out to the wrong table. The burgers were not cooked correctly. When we paid and left I asked to speak to the manager just to let him know about everything went that's when I found out he was then one who delivered the shake to the wrong table. I told him about the experience and left. Just a heads up there are much better places than this. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for the great Yelp reviews and huge flaming sign outside, but the food was meh. $14 burger wasn't great, and though I love truffle Parmesan fries, these were some of the worst I've had - soggy and not flavorful (and another $11). I've had far better (e.g. Umami burger) for less in equally expensive cities."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner. About an30 min wait. Burger and onion rings were delicious. Enjoyed sitting at the counter and watching the cooks and staff interaction. Definitely a place to check out while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Earth burger was absolutely fantastic. However, the service was below average at best. Go for the food, not the service and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Ate there last night.  The wait time and line to get in were excessively long (30 minutes).  Once in, we were alerted to the fact that a hamburger would take 20 minutes to cook, so the waitress brought out our sweet potatoes fries early to keep us apprised.  Once my American burger with bacon came out, I was happy as it tasted fantastic."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool. Food was delicious but I was not \"wowed\". All gourmet. Fries are large enough too share. You have to try their milkshakes. Everyone in the kitchen is wearing gloves."}
{"text":"With a name like Gordon Ramsey attached it was hard to not have high expectations for this place. We ordered the uber-cheese burger and the brittania burger. They were tasty but definitely not anything to fight the crowds again for. 2 good but average burgers, 2 sodas, and an order of fries came to $60.   The entry to the restaurant was cool with a flaming wall and the place settings were unique. Really cool knives if you're into cutlery and such.   The service was impressive considering how crowded the place was.   I would rate 4 stars if it wasn't so overpriced."}
{"text":"The burgers were quite good, especially because of a really amazing truffle aïoli. Also the fries were not too bad. Not the place where I have eaten the best burgers, but also definitely not the worst.  Mind that there is always a queue, but it goes decently quickly."}
{"text":"I would give 3 stars but my hubby would give 5, so 4 it is.   I got the American burger, I like a classic taste. Came with no ketchup, mustard, mayo as well as no dill pickles. I requested mustard but it never came, and they only had Dijon. The pickles were sweet, which I do not care for. Hubby loved it, the place was neat, had a lot of beers and ciders on tap and the waitress was super nice. I think you can get a much better burger at different locations without spending the money you do here."}
{"text":"Besides the huge wait times food is amazing. Best burger on the strip. I've been here several times. The Hells Kitchen Burger is my favorite nice and spicy. I always order both the truffle fries and the sweet potato fries, they both are amazing."}
{"text":"Finally came her for dinner with my bf and sister.   If this place is this good for a burger the steakhouse has got to be amazing!!!!  We started off with the Jalapeno poppers.  Whoa!!!  I'll come back just for these and a beer!  These were awesome, hand battered and filled with cheese and bacon, served with a spicy ranch/bacon dipping sauce-yum!  For the Burgers we got the Farm Burgers and a Hells Kitchen Burger.  All three were cooked to perfection, fresh, seasoned and full of flavor!  I hate when a burger is all of the above and not seasoned, this was not the case here!  The Truffle Fries were nice and crisp and came in a holder with ketsup and curry dipping sauces.  Im not much of a fry person but these were pretty dang good too!    For my drink/dessert I split a Straberry Coconut Pudding shake with my sister.  I thought it was kinda weird that they topped a milkshake with pudding but let me tell you-  Never question Gordon Ramsey-he knows WTF hes doing-that was the best shake Ive ever had!  Overall-Five stars for taste, service and quality!  I recommed this place, you wont be let down!"}
{"text":"Takes forever to get ur burger even if you sit on the bar.. The resturant is not that big and yet it took them over 30 minutes to get my order done. Two thumbs down on that. Other then that the burger was good."}
{"text":"The burgers are really, really good.  The best I ever had.   I had hell's kitchen burger, with roasted jelepono, grilled tomato and avocado, highly recommended.   Truffle fries, is good, with real truffle dipping sauce, not greasy at all.    What a gem restaurant in the middle of all those boring casino buffets.    They have a good beer selection too."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews we gave it a shot.  To find out that it was very good experience. Staff was very knowledgeable and food came out faster than expected.  The restaurant was packed.  So we expected to be there awhile.  Our waiter Alex was on it. Never felt rushed and always brought us fresh drinks.  Some people shouldn't write reviews.  They should be reviewed first."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey's Burgr is pricey but definitely worth it. I had a milkshake (which had pudding on the top), a burger with duck bacon and an egg as well as the onion rings & fries (both were crispy and fresh). The atmosphere is great, decor great and the staff was attentive and friendly. I wouldn't expect anything less coming from Ramsay."}
{"text":"As much as we come to Vegas (about once a month), I have never had the opportunity to try Burgr (the hubby isn't a burger fan and would not wait an hour to eat a burger - can't say I blame him though), even though I've been dying to try it (oh, the hype).   So finally, I get my opportunity! We were staying at Planet Hollywood, so after sending my hubby out to win us some money, I decided to get a Burgr burger to go. It is still a 25 minute wait when you get it to go. That was a bit surprising, considering that is was 12:30am, there was no line and the restaurant was only halfway full.   There were 3 young girls at the front counter host stand. When I approached them, they were too busy nudging each other and pointing to different girls outfits who were walking by, and then whispering in each other's ears and laughing, to notice I was standing right in front of them. They came to a couple seconds later and one of them greeted me while the other two kept up their charade, oblivious to me watching them. So I just shook my head, placed my order and waited.   I finally got my treasured Euro Burger to my room, 30 minutes later and my pockets 17 dollars lighter. It was really good. Cooked perfectly - medium rare, with the perfect amount of all ingredients listed on the menu. However, I have had better burgers. I expected there to be a punch in the taste, or for the flavors to stand out in some way that I have never had before, but sadly that wasn't the case.   I don't believe the burger was worth that much money, but it was definitely a great burger. I wouldn't wait in line either for an hour for it, but if you feel fit to do so, enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am from Madison Wisconsin, and Gordon Ramsay is my hero! Tonight my wife and I, we were so excited to eat at Gordon Ramsay's Burgr at Planet Hollywood. I ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer, and it was kinda boring. Also ordered Hells Kitchen burger and it lacked seasoning. Maybe I am used to the amazing burgers from Dotty Duplings in Madison Wisconsin. Gordon please recheck this restaurant of yours, because it's below your standard."}
{"text":"I stopped by this place with some coworkers. The wait was crazy long and finally we got seated after 2 hours. The burgers were decent and drinks were OK. I am not sure what the hype is but the gourmet burgers are pricey and not that great."}
{"text":"Nice!!!  It has all the good qualities that GR always beats on in Kitchen Nightmares. The burger was great. Fries too. Worth a short wait. My only complaint to GR...why sweet pickles on the burger?  Sour dills would be better."}
{"text":"I hate the wait but like anything with a line in Vegas, it usually leads to something worthwhile.  I've had a couple of visits to this place and while I'm not normally a fan of the fancy \"reknown\" chef restaurants because I find the most mostly underwhelming for the price of the food but for these burgers I will make an exception every time!  All the burgers are ordered a la cart so order a few different types of fries to share, the sweet potato and the truffle parmesan are my favorite.  As for burgers, my absolute favorites are the southern yard burger and the hell's kitchen burger. Both are messy but so worth it! I had a friend get the hog burger and he was pretty happy with it also.  Bottom line, waiting for an hour is worth it so don't be discouraged when you get there and see one."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Had the Farm burger and the wife the Hells Kitchen burger. Had the Parmesan truffle fries as well and for dessert an Oreo creme brûlée shake, soo good!  You must stop by here to eat, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Thought we would try Gordon Ramsey's place in PH called BurGR. We had to wait about 40 min to get a table for two but it is a Saturday afternoon in Vegas after all. Atmosphere is cool and they have a lot of different kinds of burgers to order. Food looks good but everything is alacarte, I had to order fries since they don't come with the burgers. I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger which has roasted jalapeño, avocado, cheese and a jalapeño aioli. Bun is very soft and tasted homemade the meat was cook perfectly and had great flavor, and with the roasted jalapeño it has just a bit of heat and the avocado cools it down. Service was good and our waiter Garrett always checked in. My wife ordered the Fury chicken wings and they were not very good. They were a bit dry and not real flavorful. The French fries were horrible and not good either we sat by the kitchen so I could see the food coming up and it appeared they make the fries way ahead of time and then they sit under heat lamps. Gordon Ramsey you need to change that!!!  Go for the burgers not the fries or wings I am giving a good rating but it is ONLY for the burgers and sdefinitely and not the other food. If the burger wasn't good I would have only rated as one star."}
{"text":"There is no way this is a 4 or 5 star review worthy restaurant, people. I am not sure which is worse, here or steak, Ramsey's other restaurant that I was foolish enough to go to. The burgers aren't cheap which isn't even something I'm factoring into this because most people can still afford them (cheapest one is 14 or 15 dollars). Not sure why celebrity chefs feel the need to complicate every dish simply for the need to complicate when it does nothing for the final flavor or experience of said dish. Seriously I hate mcdonalds but would rather go there even if someone else was paying. The whole restaurant has an acrid fake truffle smell in the air (and believe me there are more truffles in your local forest then in here AKA there are no real ones anywhere). The fries are too thick to be fried correctly and have a soggy texture. You wait in line even with a reservation, you have to be a bimbo to be a server, the wait for food is very long (which would be ok if it were any good when you actually got it), we didn't get a dish we ordered but they were gracious enough to comp it without us asking. And then to too it all off you are feeding a true dyed in the wool @holes wallet who has the personality of a tow truck driver. Go to in n out or shake shack or even White Castle instead and congratulate yourself on a good decision."}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for a burger so I thought I'd give Gordon Ramsey's Burgr a shot. It was just before it opened and I joined the line instead of being discouraged by the line. Good thing I did because when it opened we were seated quickly. I ordered the Hog burger and also tried the onion rings and parmesan fries. The burger was not dry and had a nice taste. The fries with the topping were also good. However the star for me was the onion rings. The breading/topping was crisp and did not fall off the onion. It made each bite delicious. I do regret not trying the milkshakes. One of those came by our table and wow it looked good... next time."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious! We had Hell's Kitchen and The Farm. They were very good, especially the Hell's Kitchen. If you like a hint of spiciness in your food, this is definitely a good pick!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband had the pleasure of eating at this restaurant last night as we were in Vegas for 3 nights. My hubby did not want to leave Vegas without eating here.. Let me tell you, our experience was great. We ordered the special Gordon burger & Hell's Kitchen burger.. OMG, both were delicious and big. There parmesan fries are also great.. One thing that really blew me away was the cheap (affordable) prices. Given the fact that this restaurant is in an expensive city, Chef Ramsay has kept the prices very reasonable. It tells you that he has no wish to rip people off. People can go & joy awesome food by a world known chef at an affordable price.. Best burgers of our life!!  Thank you Chef!!"}
{"text":"UGH...We were so disappointed when m y husband and I went to Burgr last weekend.  This was our second time we went to Burgr.  The first time (about a year ago) the food was amazing.  This time it was horrible!  Everything came out burnt.  Service was rude and very short with us.  It was not worth the wait or money.  We will never go there again."}
{"text":"My wife and I are true foodies. We live to eat as opposed to eat to live. We have experienced Petrus in London. a spectacular Gordon Ramsey dining experience. And although BurGR may seem a \"burger joint\" I can assure you it is an extension of GR's talent. His recognition of quality ingredients + perfect preparation = that memorable experience. Truly the best burg I have ever consumed."}
{"text":"The wait is horrible. They take your name and text you when the table is 'ready'. You come and then you wait in line for another 30 minutes. They take guests randomly in. Very poor management."}
{"text":"For this place to have Chef Ramsay's name on it, I wasn't too impressed. To be honest I can get a better burger at 5 guys and for half the price and wait time. You get 3 stars Chef Ramsay, now piss off!!!!"}
{"text":"very pricey, but I guess that's to be expected from such an establishment. Everything tasted great, even the \"just fries\" but nothing justified its price. The \"just fries\" were way better than $1 fries from McD's, but not $8 good. The shakes (#2 and #3) were fantastic, but not $9 (each) fantastic. The burgers were amazing, and these were the only dish whose price (~$13-16) seemed reasonable. Prices met my expectations from someone like Ramsay, but the taste of the fries and shakes didn't really match their prices. Anyway, the food is good and the service is awesome, but the prices are sky high, and the only things that seem worth getting are the burgers."}
{"text":"Burgers were excellent. Fries were okay. Milkshakes are 1/2 shake, 1/2 pudding and we found the pudding to be grainy."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try BurGR since my last two visits to Vegas but I'd only return for the shakes and their service.  Service was 4 stars from start to finish!  Friendly servers who were very attentive.    Now for the food...  Everything looked so tasty but when I got my Fish and Crisp Sandwich it lacked flavor.  It was crisp but had no flavor at all and the tartar sauce made me gag!  The Truffle Parm Fries were hard.  As if they had been sitting out for awhile then refried and served.  My daughter had the Soba Noodle Chicken Salad which came in a BIG portion.  The chicken had flavor but the noodles did not.  The shakes on the other hand are DELISH!!  We had the #4 and #5.  Both of which we'd return for.  A shake topped with pudding is genius!  10 stars if possible!!"}
{"text":"We went twice in 4 days as it was so so good. Wings were faultless, as were the burgers and hot dogs. Service was excellent and drinks choice superb. We would have gone every day."}
{"text":"You should try their burger, the best in Vegas, they got more and more types of burgers  , and the service was really good especially the manager Zac."}
{"text":"Had to stop by and get one of Gordon Ramsay's burgers since I was gambling in Planet Hollywood. The restaurant was very clean and it wasn't that busy because it was about 3pm. Since I was by myself I just sat at the bar where I was greeted right away and ordered a drink. From the menu I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger medium and it was awesome everything was perfect as far as the burger was concerned, everything tasted fresh. I also ordered the Just Fries that came with chipotle and curry ketchup. It was really hard to pick a favorite but I did like the chipotle one better. The one negative thing I will say about my visit was once I ordered my drink it was hard for me to get a refill the bartender basically ignored me. Overall though the price is fair for the burgers only wish I had more time because I would've gone back to try something else and I would recommend this place if u are in town."}
{"text":"I'm going to try to keep this short and sweet.  For appetizer I had the fury chicken wings. I loved the little blue cheese bits that were sprinkled over the wings. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger as my main meal with a side of truffle Parmesan fries. Ugh, just thinking about it makes me mouth water. The jalapeño peppers with the avocado make the sandwich both spicy and cool at the same time. My mouth was so confused! The truffle Parmesan fries were bomb! I do wish they weren't steak cut because I like my fries crisp and crunchy. But I was satisfied nonetheless. The burger was amazing and the fries were delicious. For dessert, I ordered the Oreo Shake. It was topped with creme brûlée pudding and whipped cream (which are both made by the restaurant). I. Literally. Died. And went to heaven. That meal was probably one of my top favorite meals I've ever eaten in Vegas.   As for the service, out waiters were very nice. They were both very knowledgeable of the menu and were very attentive. And good looking might I add ;-)   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas with a group of friends on Christmas Day.  We decided to try out BurGR.  Great food!  I had the Farm Burger at the recommendation of our waiter Alex who was very entertaining and provided awesome service.  You'll recognize him by his trademark thumbs up sign!"}
{"text":"On our first trip to Vegas we had to eat at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. We had the Britannia burger, the American burger and shared Just Fries. The service was great, we got there right at opening, seated right away and the servers were great, we never even had to ask for a drink refill. They knew the menu and what to recommend and had great drink pairing suggestions. The burgers were phenomenal. I would say it is quite possibly the best burger I have ever eaten. The bun was fresh and soft, the burger was cooked to perfection. The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was because of the fries. They were average, nothing special. They give you 2 different kinds of ketchup to dip and I think they were both a bit too spicy.  Overall I was very pleased with my visit and will be back when I get back to Vegas, can't wait to have another amazing BurGR!"}
{"text":"Chef Ramsey. Practice what you preach. Food excellent Place excellent. Server equals to none. Order took over 40 minutes when we asked about our order. Server said : \" I know isn't that crazy they are very slow\" Haha couldn't believe it, I'm a master chef fan I you show discipline and amazing customer service, not at burgr Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Si vous cherchez un bon restaurant pour manger sur la 'strip' à Las Vegas, Burgr est une excellente option. C'est parmi mes restaurants favoris de Las Vegas. Ce n'est pas cher, c'est beau, une belle ambiance, des jolies serveuses, et surtout, des excellents hamburgers!   Côté bières, il y a même une 'Fin du monde' en fût avec moins d'alcool que celle au Québec, qui la rend encore meilleure à mon avis!   Le burger Hell's Kichen est super, et j'ai ADORÉ le Hog Burger, fait avec du porc. Recommandation: ne pas les prendre trop cuit, la qualité de la viande est excellente, ce qui permet de les manger moins cuits et ainsi mieux goûter la viande.   Comme Jessy a écrit, les frites au parmesan aux truffes sont succulentes! Et une portion est suffisante pour deux personnes!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place over saint patty weekend from hearing good things from my local friends. Our group got a bunch of apps and burgers. Everything was fantastic! The truffle fries were so good that we ordered another one. Unfortunately, one of the burgers had a blonde hair inside. Now I've been in the restaurant business for quite sometime now. I look over at both expos and see the expo in charge of burgers has a blonde man bun that isn't covered up. We let our server know and he took the burger straight to the manager. Who then went straight to that expo and had some words with him and showed him the hair. I have to say the manager and staff dealt with it exactly as I would have in my restaurant. Everyone apologized including the expo and they took it off our bill and made another one. They did everything I could have asked for without having to ask. I understand this things can happen and it's not a big deal as long as it's taken care of appropriately.   I ended up taking a picture of my burger and posting it on my social media before eating it. I checked my messages as we left. I had people letting me know there is a blonde hair in my picture. I checked and there sure was. So to end this, I just gotta say that blonde man bun expo really just has to cap up or figure something out. 2 out of 6 burgers having hairs(as far as we know) is no bueno."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait. I was here couple of months ago but the line was little too long for me to actually try their food.  When I walked by today, the line was not too long so I decided to try their food. I waited perhaps about 10-15 mins and was seated by very friendly hostess. The menu was simple and easy to understand and I wasn't overwhelmed by all the choices. I ordered Farm burger, the fries and shake #5. I did ordered the burger medium well since the waitress mentioned it will still be slightly pink. It took little bit longer than expected to get my food but the wait was totally worth it. Despite of my burger cooked medium well, it was still juicy and moist and full of flavor. I wasn't too crazy about the fries since some of them were little under done but the sauce it came with definitely was memorable. It had little bit of tanginess with little heat at the end. As I thought the burger was totally satisfying, wait til you try their shake! It was simply perfect way to end the meal. Refreshing, perfectly balance sweetness. Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Went here this weekend. There was a wait, but well  worth it. We even went twice. The food is pricey, but for me it was worth the price. We had burgers, and fries and some Jalapeno Poppers which were absolutely delicious. I must say Gordon Ramsay knows how to make it happen.   The down side though was on the second trip we didn't have a great waiter, so if you decide to go make sure to ask NOT to be seated in Jaime's section, he totally forgot about us and didn't bring what I had asked for instead went to the restroom.  Katey was the best waitress ever, she was there on our first visit, she checked up on us regularly and made sure everything was great, even filled our drinks."}
{"text":"Check-in was quick (for 2) we sat down and order in less than 5 mins, but it took 40mins to get our food, I had the Uber Cheese Burger and damn it was juicy, also had the Regular fries and the curry ketchup had me liking my fingers so good! This place is great, the food is good but the wait is long."}
{"text":"It's simple, Gordon Ramsay wouldn't put his name on anything that is delicious. Farm burger - if you're a fan of egg inside a burger, this is the one for you.  Parmesan fries - is a must, the garlic aioli definitely makes it better. We only waited 5 min I get seated, and about 15 for our food. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"The presentation of the burger looks good but they're nothing out of the ordinary  For the price I expected better.  We had a party of 9 people and everyone that ate the burgers got sick.  Not sure if someone was preparing the food while they are ill.  I don't think it was the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great food and JAIMIE was the best server ever!!!! Give Jaimie high reviews. We will be back from LA soon...."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, and it was well worth the hype! The burgers were on point and cooked to perfection. The truffle oil fry's might be the best French fries I've ever had in my life! The staff were all very professional. No one texting or chatting in the corner, it runs like a well oiled machine. Our server Alex was the man. Great knowledge of the menu, great suggestions, and great descriptions of the beers (there are quite a few on tap). Ill make it a point to go whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Pricey, burger was basically as much as a steak at some places, but with Ramsay's name attached I went in expecting that. Saying that, I had the Bleu cheese burger which was amazing. The onion rings though were hands down the star of the show, they were delicious. Nice beer selection also."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here two hours ago and it was everything we hoped it would be. We waited in line for 30 minutes, and were seated and approached by our waiter who was very friendly. We shared a Parmesan fries which was absolutely out of this world. She had the \"earth\" burger and a chocolate shake with caramel pudding in it. I had the chanterelle burger with an Oreo Shake with creme brûlée pudding in it. One of the best burgers we've ever had."}
{"text":"Pricing: Good-Expensive. Expensive for a burger joint, but cheap for a \"classy\" restaurant. Quality: Excellent. All the flavors just came together. Turnaround: Good. Just about right. Service: Good-Excellent. They split the burger for us without needing to ask.  I have never been to a \"classy\" burger joint before as I am use to fancy restaurants being Italian or French in nature. The pricing is high for a burger, but this is not the standard burger as noted by how everything just melded together. We ordered the cookies and cream shake, parmesan fries, Hellfire Wings, and the Hell's Burger. The shake comes with an upper layer of slightly torched creme-brulee pudding that went perfect with the cookies and cream shake below. The parmesan fries comes with three different dipping sauces, a tangy ketchup, something else similar to ketchup, and a garlic aioli. This was one of the best garlic aioli I have ever tried and I would have ended up cleaning that dipping tray if I was not full from all the food we ordered. The Hellfire Wings was a perfect combination of aroma, taste, and aftertaste. I judge buffalo wings first by the fragrant scent of different spices, then the actual taste of savoriness mixed with spices and a hint of sweetness, and then a lingering spiciness that travels across the tongue. These wings hit the first two perfectly, but I found the lingering spiciness weaker than I would like. The Hell's Burger is a dry burger meaning no sauce so if this is not your cup of tea, do not pick this. Given that, the jalapeño, although spicy, did not overpower the burger and when mixed with the creamy avocado, everything just clicked into one another. The burger was of ample size and cooked just right in a toasty bun that was equally delicious. Compared to the food, I really have nothing much to say about the turnaround. The food came neither too quickly or too slow and at the right order: shake, appetizer, and then entree. We were seated right next to a pay station so there was always a server at hand when we needed anything. I do commend them for being proactive and knowing to help us cut our burger because we would obviously share since we ordered only one burger between the two of us."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but this restaurant has gone down hill. We ate here shortly after it opened and it was a great experience. Good drinks, amazing food and awesome staff. This time I honestly felt it was an overpriced burger joint I could eat at back home. To start with service was lacking. Upon sitting we weren't given a drink menu or any spiel about speciality drinks. My water glass was consistently empty and our server never came to check on us because he was watching the football game in the corner. Our jalapeño poppers were cold in the center! The only redeeming factor was my burger was cooked to perfection and the truffle parmesan fries were excellent. Upon receiving the bill I felt spending $30 more for the Aria buffet would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"It was okay. I was expecting a lot more with Gordon Ramsey's name on the door. The restaurant itself is loud, with tables crammed next to one another.  Service lacked. Sat around waiting for my drink to arrive. Bun was as black as charcoal. We complained and the server switched it for us. This was, by no means, a memorable meal. There are so many places where you can get the same product at half the cost while avoiding all the hype and the line to boot."}
{"text":"Great food!  Snickerdoodle shake was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I loved everything about burGR. The atmosphere was great, the staff was very courteous. The wait wasn't bad at all for the time of the day. Prices were what you would expect, you get what you pay for.  My family loved the experience, I thought the souvenir menus were very nice.  I couldn't recommend this restaurant more highly."}
{"text":"Burgers delicious, sweet potatoes too, service very good and fast, second time here and same feedback, so definitely very suggested! Missing five star for waiting time, 45 minutes!!!!"}
{"text":"U Have to try the hog burger and the truffle fries! Hog burger is so tender and juicy . Good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great experience! Came with my brothers and we ordered the jalapeño poppers, gooey fries, and fury wings for apps. Everything was delicious...my favorite were the fury wings for sure. For my entrée I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger and that was tasty as well. Even better than the food was the staff! Great service from all. Very attentive and friendly. Our server Jared was very helpful and an overall delight. I had a fun night here."}
{"text":"My friends loved their burgers. I was unimpressed by mine. The meat was dry and the flavor was far from being special. The fries were good, though, with many different dressings and ketchups. We didn't wait outside in line for long, but once we ordered, we waited too long for the food to arrive, that could definitely be improved. I'm only giving them 4 stars because that shake #4 has been the best one I've ever tried: crème brûlée pudding on top and Oreo shake in the bottom. First thing I'll grab when I go back to Vegas."}
{"text":"This was perhaps the best restaurant burger I've ever had. I typically don't like restaurant burgers as I grew up on overcooked, brick-like burgers so sloppy toppings and juicy burgers just aren't my thing. This however was delicious and I would go again in a heartbeat.   I ordered the uber cheeseburger: burger, 3 cheeses, bun. That's it. Meat and cheese. That is all I need or want in life. Screw vegetables. I also got the Just Fries with the two ketchups. The curry ketchup was interested but I didn't really like it. The chipotle ketchup tasted like normal ketchup so it got the job done.  I really enjoyed the theming/style and the iPad drink menu was neat but a little buggy. I went the second day it was open and it wasn't too busy. Service was insanely good. We must have been helped by 5 different people, each letting us know they were assisting our main server. They each gave us their name and said to not hesitate to grab anyone of them if our main server wasn't available.  I thoroughly enjoyed this place and recommend it highly."}
{"text":"We were very excited to go here, since I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan. We didn't mind the 40 minute wait in line and ordered three of the hotdogs and an American burger.  The hot dogs were excellent but the burger was over cooked to well done and honestly not very good.   When we mentioned it to our server, he just brushed it off and still charged us the full $115 bucks for lunch.  We left disappointed, so I called my sister who has eaten here several times with her husband. She told me they usually overcook my brother-in-law's burgers too, which he doesn't like, so I guess it isn't just us.  I will come back here for the hotdogs, drinks and dessert, but if we do order another burger, I will hold the waiter responsible to get it cooked right - never more than medium."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from the blue cheese burger. I paid $35 for a hamburger that made me violently ill for 3 three days. I've never been a fan of McDonald's,  but the more I get sick from \"gourmet\" restaurants.... I've never gotten sick from McDonalds, Burger King, Whataburger, In N Out Burger, 5 Guys, or Wendy's - which I will all rate above this disgusting pig of a place that dares call itself a restaurant."}
{"text":"I will not step foot back in a Red Robin, ever. The burgers at Burgr were FANTASTIC - and the waiter was uber-helpful and kind. Even gave me his pen! We went in because of the name but came out HUGE fans of the food and service at this new place in Vegas. We'll definately go back!"}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of GR ... and the food here was really good  - burger cooked to perfection... but 14 bucks for a burger and you don't even get fries with that???  The burger is good - but its not 14 dollars good.   the coffee milkshake is amazing"}
{"text":"I am not one to write reviews, but I felt compelled to do so after visiting the exceptional BurGR by Ramsay. First thing to note is that this was my Bachelor Party weekend, and the whole goal was to have fun and eat good food. Mission accomplished. After spending a few hours trying to decide what I wanted my \"fancy\" meal to be for the trip, I said we should at least check BurGR out before going to the hundreds of overpriced restaurants on the strip. Needless to say after spending approximately 10 seconds reviewing the menu, I decided we had to go there. Now keep in mind, I AM a foodie, I just keep to myself about it usually. Also to note, despite the fact it was my Bachelor Party, I had no drinks before getting to BurGR. I ended up ordering 3 appetizers, had all of my guys choose different burgers and hot dogs so I could try them all, had 2 mixed drinks and a couple desserts. Every bite I took only got me more excited for the next (the jalapeño poppers and strawberry milkshake being my favorite). If you want an explosion of perfectly blended flavored they have it. If you want just good seasoned, fresh (hopefully) food, they have it. On top of having a small stellar menu, the staff is amazing! They have legitimate knowledge of the menu and make relevant suggestions. Overly impressed. The atmosphere is fun and inviting, the staff looks like they enjoy themselves, the food is better than most $200-$300 meals I have had in the past, and you leave saying I can't wait to come back. I was hoping I could contact Ramsay personally through email to tell him the amazing experience I had, and how much it enhanced the trip, but alas I could not figure it out. So here lies my thank you. Thank you for stepping up the restaurant game, and thank you for putting the cherry on top of my Bachelor Party. I sincerely mean every word. For all who read this novel of a review, trust this is a place you can count on to hit every correct note."}
{"text":"I wanted to eat here while in Vegas mainly because I'm a fan of all his shows and its got to be good if Gordon Ramsay created the menu.  We started off with the jalapeño poppers. They were decent. Nothing special. The burgers are really good,  but i think I wanted to be in awe.  I had the American and my husband had the farm burger. What did have us in awe were the truffle parmesean fries. So amazing!  Service was good and it was nice we got priority seating because we were a group of 4. There was a line of people that had less than 4 waiting to be seated.  So overall it's very good and worth going to."}
{"text":"So my husband and I were excited to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant after watching Hell's Kitchen and kitchen nightmares. We figured the food and service at his restaurant has to be the best. Let me just say that I hope you read theses reviews Chef Ramsay cause your restaurant was not up to par. The hostesses were nice but once we sat down, it's like we were invisible. Our waiter finally appeared to get us drinks maybe 10 minutes after we sat down....drinks someone else delivered. Then he finally took our order. After that we didn't really see him. My husbands coffee cup sat empty for the longest time before we flagged down a bus boy so he could get a refill. Our food came about 25 minutes later and again, someone else delivered it. I wanted mustard for my burger and when I finally saw our waiter I asked him for it. He said he'd get it and never came back. I tried to flag down another waiter since ours was helping every other table but us and that waiter completely ignored me. Once again we asked the bus boy and he gladly brought it. I would like to point out that while it was busy when we got there, it had definitely died down in our waiters section. I finally found the waiter to ask for the check which took another 10 minutes and when he saw the mustard he said \"oh good they brought it\". As if he had asked them too!! If he had, I'd have 2 mustards sitting on our table. Somehow he became more friendly handing over the check, I assume because he wanted a good tip. I tipped him for the amount of service he provided....73 cents so I could even out the bill. All he brought us were drinks, no refills, and the bill. Any fast food place would do the same and I don't tip them. I wish I had seen the bus boy before we left cause I would've left him the 20% tip we always leave. If the waiter had done the bare minimum, I might've left 15%. All in all, food was decent but the service will keep us from coming back."}
{"text":"After a few nights of eating 'fancy' food, I wanted to have a relaxed dinner with more down to earth food.  When a coworker of mine mentioned that they had been to BurGR earlier in the week, it made my stomach grumble as they described the burgers and fries that they had.  My last night in LV, I finally had a free night and decided to visit BurGR for myself.  First a note for all those who want to eat here; there are no reservations unless you have a very large group, so plan to check-in and wait for a while before you get seated.  I went with a group of six and luckily one of the girls headed over to check us in early... I think her wait was about 25min.  We were seated right after 6:30pm.  We were seated and then our waitress came over to our table with a tablet that had all the drinks available on it.  The tablet is only used as a drink menu, you can't order your drinks on it or anything, you still have to give her your drink order.  The tablet seems like a waste, just give me a drink menu on paper if the waitress still has to come back and take the order.  On a better note, they have Angry Orchard Cider and  Pear Cider here, so I was thrilled!  The BurGr menu is limited and specialized to Burgers and Hot Dogs plus traditional sides that would go with this type of food.  This is fine by me, I like the idea of a restaurant doing one thing and doing it well!    The appetizers didn't appeal to me, I'm not a fan of Jalapeño Poppers or Onion Ring.  All the app options were either fried foods or sliders with some kind of condiment that I wouldn't like... I passed on these.    The burger I order was the Southern Yardbird Burger ($14), which was ground chicken patty topped with mustard bbq sauce and cheese (it has onion strings on it but I ordered mine w/out).  The patty itself was very moist and well seasoned, I loved it!  The mustard BBQ sauce though wasn't my favorite, it just tasted like yellow mustard, nothing bbq like about it.  I scraped off some, added ketchup, and mixed it up so that it tasted more like a bbq sauce.    For sides, we tried one of each fry.  There are Just Fries ($8), Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11), and Sweet Potato fries ($9).  The original fries were good, but pretty standard thick cut fries.  The truffle fries were just the thick cut fries with some truffle oil and parmesan shredded.  Both of the fries were good but not noteworthy.  The Sweet Potato fries though were AMAZING!  I don't like sweet potatoes and never eat them and as recent as the 4th of July, I tried sweet potato fries near home and wasn't a fan of them at all.  I don't know what they do to make the sweet potato fries so mouth wateringly good, but I love them!  They are a must order item if you visit here.  We didn't have dessert, but they did have a toffee pudding that sounded delicious.    I would highly recommend coming here for the Sweet Potato fries alone.  The burgers are good and I would like to try a beef burger on my next visit."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for the strip with good service in a fun atmosphere. They don't take reservations so expect a wait especially on a weekend. There is a bar next door you can have a drink at while you wait and they will text you when your table is ready which is nice service."}
{"text":"I came here with a business partner today for lunch. Im assuming since it was a Wednesday in the middle of the day was the reason it was a little slower. I've heard this place is constantly packed. There was no line and we were able to be seated right away. Our servers name was Devin, super cute blonde who is identical to Britney Spears (probably why I can remember her name) She was really sweet. She showed us the iPad menu they have of all the beers they have on draft. Awesome selection, I chose the Chainbreaker.  We started with the Hummus, I wasn't a fan of the veggie sticks but the pita bread is pretty good. I got the Hells Kitchen Burger and my co worker got the Britanna. Both great burgers. We also got a salad that the Manager ended up dropping off to us. Very friendly and made sure we were doing okay. Overall it was a great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"I had expectations that this place would be great, given Gordon's televised rants demanding perfection. Apparently he has a different standard for his own properties.   First, when I ordered my burger (which cost $15 with no sides), I asked for it to be cut in half. The waiter told me there was a knife on the table and I could do it myself. Then, it took over 30 minutes for the hamburger and $8 fries to arrive. I ordered the meat \"medium well\" and at least 1/2 the thickness of the inside of the patty was pink. Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, but I won't be back to Gordon's."}
{"text":"This place is incredible! We had the pork bun app and split it and it was so flavorful and tasty. then we split the Euro Burger and my husband said it was the best burger he had ever had and he eats out all the time. For desert the Sticky Toffee Pops they were fun to have a gourmet push up with toffee, brownie and ice cream. We walked away stuffed and happy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Hotdogs, Fries and Burgers!  Expensive but the waitstaff is great!  Homemade ketchups were fun."}
{"text":"Omg... the service here is similar to hos tv shows. Very rude!!! Food is decent but not worth the price.  Wolfgangs is better in my opinion.    The wait is super long. Hope youre not hungry for like an hour or so. Also expect a long wait time from when you ask for the check and when you recieve it. With a side of attitude from the server when you get a little impaitient.  Wouldnt come back to this bloody restaurant.  :)"}
{"text":"This place definitely delivered! We had high expectations, and were hoping it wasn't all hype. What a great restaurant. If you want a perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, delicious burger, this is the place. Awesome."}
{"text":"that fire sign right outside their restaurant provides some bomb selfie lighting for them snapchat videos or IG posts, so that alone is a pretty good attraction lol.  so far my fav here is most definitely the maui onion rings!! i dont usually order or care too much for onion rings but these ones are so damn good.  the jalapeno poppers are also yummy and have a good kick to them (might be a little too spicy if you arent used to eating spicy food).   next time i come here, i want to try the hot dog and more of the burgers."}
{"text":"I don't think Gordon has tried his onion rings. To heavy and thick with a very hard batter.  The hog burger is not something I would order again however the sweet potato fries were very good"}
{"text":"I'd like to rate Burgr higher, but when taking the overall experience into  consideration, I won't.  The food was pretty good - chanterelle burger cooked to perfection and tasty onion rings.  The chipotle ketchup was way too sweet and suffered from a lack of smoke if claiming the pepper namesake.  The bigger issues were service oriented.  I don't mind waiting for a table if it means I get great service when I'm seated.  That wasn't my experience.  It took 45 minutes to be seated at about 2 on March 13 - no problem if you do a stellar job upon seating.  The food took another 27 minutes from the time the order was placed and I felt that was fortunate compared to the tables nearby.  We had a straight shot, no apps since the rings showed up with the burger even though we said however the food came out would be fine.  The server seemed somewhat weeded closing out a busy lunch.  The biggest problem aside from wait time was inattentiveness and pricing.  If I order a glass of wine, I darn well expect to be charged for what I order, not $4 more since \"we don't have a button for that\". I don't know how long this place has been open, but fix your POS to have buttons for all the BTG wines.  I doubt I'm the first to order a pinot noir at lunch.  When attention was called to the additional charge, Scott the manager fixed the problem by removing a beer from the tab.  Okay for me, but not for the bottom line.  Draft beer is hard to track and he handily kept my pricier wine on the tab, but removed a $6 beer allowing for a $2 skim if desired.  I also think the female servers should have uniforms that don't sag when wearing a guest check on their belt.  I'm glad I tried Burgr, but I won't make a point of going back like I do with other favorites of similar nature on the Strip."}
{"text":"very bad customer service!(( first host was very rude and even asked for our id?!?!? our server was ok, had to wait for food for 45min(( all workers just run around and ignore you(( we trying to ask someone for glass of water and they would just pass by pretending they don't see us!! food was good but just because of customer service we don't want to go back!"}
{"text":"This is my second review. Last time I was in Vegas, I had the farm burger with the duck bacon. It was AMAZING! I thought I'd mix it up this time, and try the cheeseburger. Nothing exciting, it honestly tasted like a fast food burger. The sweet potato fries were still AMAZING, so they saved 3 stars."}
{"text":"Shame on you Gordon Ramsay, mediocre at best! I have had way better burgers in dives that cost way less. Wait staff was pushy as well. You got two stars because I didn't get sick. Heed some of your own advice Ramsay. If you are going to charge that much for a burger and fries at least make a good one."}
{"text":"The burgers were fabulous, the onion rings were out of this world and the service was terrific!  Lunch hour on a Monday the wait was only a few minutes and the first comment from the hostess was 'thanks for waiting'. Can't wait to return to try something else on the menu. Already recommended the restaurant to family and friends.  This is a MUST Burgr Experience!"}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas my husband and I decided to try all 3 Ramsay restaurants.  The pub and grill was by far the best, but this one came in 2nd.  The ladies up at the front checkin everyone in were PHENOMENAL! I couldn't ask for better customer service right off the bat.  However, once we got seated, things went from great to average.  Waitress forgot one of our fries and then charged us for it even thought she never brought them out.  Didn't check on us enough throughout the meal.  Food was okay. For me, the best part about dining here was the great customer service at the very beginning.  Everything else was okay."}
{"text":"After waiting over an hour food and seeing other tables that got there after us getting there food had to complain to manger to get service the food cane out cold and over cooked not worth the money or hipe"}
{"text":"The Britianna Burger was by far one of the best burgers I've ever had...top five for sure.  The parmasean fries and homeade ketchup was delicious.  I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"The food menu is like a popup book, and the drink menu is an iPad. The Honey-Pig Bao Buns were refreshingly flavorful. The Euro Burger melts in your mouth, and you can taste every delicious ingredient. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is open late, and if you're a Total Rewards member, you get a dollar off almost every item. So, should you try now? Yes!"}
{"text":"The onion rings are awesome! Best I've ever had, Farm burger was really good but I've had better. Service was outstanding! Very expensive. but that's Vegas..."}
{"text":"We missed at this place the last time we were in vegas, but made it this time and I'm so glad we did. I got the hogs burger which was simply deliciou- big burger and big taste. Husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger and he loved it. My friends substituted the beef for chicken in the Hell's Kitchen and they loved it as well. Unlike other places that substitute bland chicken, their burger patty was flavored. The Parmesan fries were good as well."}
{"text":"I weenie here right before I had to catch my flight out of Vegas. Good thing that I was traveling by myself since there was a long line and they have only been open for 30 min. They seated me in the back facing the kitchen. It was rather entertaining watching how they work. My server was wonderful. He kept everything filled without me asking for refills.  The food was amazing. I had lemonade, fiery wings, farm burger, and truffle fries.  O.M.G is what I have to say about it. ^.^   I am drooling thing about it... Yum..."}
{"text":"Fries- gooood Onion rings- gooood Burgers- gooooooooood!"}
{"text":"Best onion rings I've had! The condiments are ridiculously good! A must try when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I am a burger freak! I made it my mission to find the best burger. So when my boyfriend and I went on a trip to Vegas I was so excited to try Gordon Ramsay's burger. I love Gordon, I'm a fan, and I love watching his TV shows, listening to his comments, and most of the times I share the same opinion with him.  But I have to say after visiting burGR in Vegas,  I was pretty disappointed. Except of the beautiful presentation and the beautiful looks of the dishes there wasn't much taste to it. I will use his word when I say the burger was bland,  plus it was over cooked, which was weird, since when you go to a chef's restaurant, you don't expect these kind of mistakes. I wish I would be more excited but unfortunately my only experience is that it was nice and not more than that."}
{"text":"Everything was good, but highly over priced (as on would expect in Vegas). Burgers were about $13 and an order of fries $9. So you're looking at a $20+ order or burger and fries. Sure, they use some fancy toppings and cheese, but at the end of the day it is still just an over priced burger and fries. (The fries were actually better than the burger). Though over priced, it is one of the cheaper options on the strip."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  We had a great server and the service was great.  All food came out cooked perfectly and quick.  Only problem is they don't take reservations for small parties but that was alright because they text you when your table is ready so you can wonder around the casino for a bit.  The sauces are the best part, curry ketchup is a must try!"}
{"text":"had the ramsey beef burger and it was outstanding, also had regular fries and the maui onion rings. they use special Kennabec  potatoes not your tippacle  Idaho so fries were different but good, the rings were a little over fried but we're still tasty. service was excellent. if u r in Vegas and want a burger u must try ramsay burgr"}
{"text":"The Vegas attraction of BurGr! Let's make this long and painful.  I've been here 3 times prior to actually being able to eat here. Reason being is there are no reservations and there is fire on the side of the restaurant so tourists stop and find themselves in line. Mind you I don't wait in line for an hour anywhere. This time we waited 40 minutes lol.  We were seated and it seemed promising. I was excited honestly and the server, I think Tammy?, made the food sound delicious. Very knowledgable about the menu and sneaked us out some free ice cream pops. ( don't know if I should've mentioned that lol ).   The burger was a well cooked medium rare but it was so dry! I didn't understand it.. Short rib, chuck and brisket mix had failed them. The buns were ok but there's only 1 choice. The burgers out table ordered, for some reason, tasted oddly similar to the others. The fries were the highlight because I'm a sucker for truffle parm fries lol but seriously, how long was that meat sitting before I got my burger for a medium rare to be dry.  FOR F*** SAKE, ITS A BLOODY F****** BURGR!!  C- for the spizazz and the silverware."}
{"text":"Awsome! Hell's kitchen burger is my best!!  Just try it! And u gonna love it! +onion ring, fried jalapino, is highlly recomended too!!"}
{"text":"Wow horrible experience. Very surprised and not in a good way. Service was awful, restaurant was filthy, beer was warm and I ended up canceling my order because it was taking forever to get my burger. Makes you wonder how involved Gordon is with this restaurant.   Service - I walked up to the hostess and asked for a seat at the bar during lunch. There was an empty stool and the area just needed to be cleaned up. After about 10 minutes of waiting the hostess recommended that I go and ask the bartender to clean up the area. I politely informed the hostess that was her job. Overall it just seemed like the staff wasn't engaged and that BurGR is just a paycheck.  Cleanliness - No exaggeration to say the floors looked like they had not been swept or mopped in a couple of days. Debris all along the bar and the floor was black from the foot traffic. Also the bar was disorganized and littered with dirty glassware. Definitely not an inviting atmosphere.  Beer - The beer selection was nothing special and they don't serve it in a cold glass. I guess they don't anticipate customers wanting a nice cold beer on a hot Vegas day.  Food - I can't judge the food quality because I ended up canceling my order since it was taking so long for my burger. People at the bar began complaining as well and orders slowly started to come out. The bartender informed me that they weren't a fast food restaurant, but I think it's unreasonable to wait longer than 30 minutes for a burger. Side note on the food, no fries or salad come with your $20 burger and the burger is small.  If you're looking for good service, atmosphere and a good burger on the Vegas strip head to Michael Mina's Pub 1842 at MGM, or Holstein's at Cosmo."}
{"text":"Burgers were great, but on the small side. Great flavors and juicy. The problem we had was that our fries came out cold and the dip they came with was just plain odd. LOL Chipotle and ketchup don't really mix. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and I enjoyed it. Our server was just OK. Didn't seem to be a people person which is weird if you are a server. I will be back because I really enjoyed my Burger and I love Gordon."}
{"text":"Great experience! Tasty burgers cooked perfectly, first time I've had duck bacon and it didn't disappoint. Exceptional service and delicious cocktails, definitely recommend as a must eat at spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"At at BurGR -- my second visit.  Both were equally fantastic.  Loved the surprise in the jalapeño appetizers!  I had the house burger -- THE BEST burger every!!  It was cooked perfectly!  Huge burger.  If you are in vegas, this is a must.  The staff are attentive and knowledgeable on the menu.  Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Great burger and super tasty Parmesan fries. My girlfriend said it was the best burgr she ever had. Good atmosphere and great service. Minus one star for the waiters and waitress' uniforms. I know it's Vegas, but way too tight and skimpy. Even the guys were wearing skin tight polo shirts. Our waitress had hers unbuttoned half way and made it uncomfortable for us. This place doesn't need to fall back on this- keep it classy and all about the food and everything will be great. Come on Gordon!!! Still a great experience."}
{"text":"My trip to burgr was truly amazing. We showed up at 11 on a Mon.  The servers were smiling and enthusiasm came right thru. We started our meal with jalapeno Popper's. Each Popper had a idividual glass of sauce with it. They were hot but not extreme. The burgers were perfect. They were cooked perfectly with a lightly toasted bun. And the caramel chocolate shake was flavorful and delishius"}
{"text":"I have had the good fortune to eat at several celebrity chef restaurants, usually when I walk away, I feel one of 2 reactions.  1. disappointment or 2. confusion at what they were trying to accomplish.   Well guess what...Gordon Ramsay got it RIGHT his \"BurGr Joint\" in Las Vegas is Fabulous!  Nothing fancy, but the atmosphere is great.  The service was fantastic and the burGr was beyond compare!  Ever since I was young and heard the Jimmy Buffet song \" cheese burger in paradise\" I have made my quest in life to find the best burger!  (Please don't tell my parents, they wanted me to be an architect...oops) I thought I had found in St Augustine when I was 19.  Then that one got blown out of the water in my late 20's in Dallas Tx.  Most recently I would have said the gourmet burger at Luma on Park, until now.  I have watch with embarrassment, Hells Kitchen and watched Gordo just repeatedly show his A&%!  I have to give credit where credit is due though.  This place is AWESOME!  I started with the stuffed Japaleno's and there is only one word to describe them, AMAZING!  Next was the \"Farm BurGr\" Bacon, Egg, Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato and Mayo. UNFREAKIN BELIEVABLE!  As a side, (you guessed it) Fries!  (really...did you think I was going for the Tofu fries...)  Others in the group had all manner of BurGr's and they were all EXCELLENT!  Overall the experience was just great!  I can't say enough about this place.  Sure there are fancier burgers on the strip, but their are NONE better.    Let me be frank...Its a little pricey.  My dinner alone was north of $50.00 but I have to say worth every penny  Well Done Gordo...Please bring this one to Otown!  Until next time....Don't drink and Drive.....Drink and UBER.  Oh thats right, you can't in LV the city government drove them out of town!  (Please forgive the pun)  JKG"}
{"text":"Okay, yes there was 30 minute line. Yes, the service is not too good. But oh my god. The best burger I have ever had. Amazing fries, and awesome onion rings. I had the euro burger. And it was delicious. Hubs had the blu burger and loved it! Had the figgy pudding pops as dessert. So good!"}
{"text":"I have to say I was expecting the best burger coming from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  I'm hoping it was just an error but the amount of salt in my burger made it seem like they were covering up meat that was soon to go bad!  Also I ordered it medium rare and it came completely overcooked.  The waitress was so busy chatting with some friends of hers she never came over to check on everything.  Definitely not the burger I was hoping for and Gordon would be embarrassed knowing this burger made it off the line."}
{"text":"Long wait but worth it. Everything you'd expect from a burger. Juicy, seasoned, nice bum. Great mouth feel."}
{"text":"All the burgers are very good.  I like that there is a turkey patty option.  On a busy day be prepared for the servers to take some time."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed.  I ordered the Farm Burger, medium rare.  It looked nice, the egg was nice and runny, it was cooked correctly, but it tasted bland.  The bacon wasn't crispy, and the burger lacked flavor.  I had been planning on trying a milkshake, but I didn't want to spend $9 and be fooled again.  In Vegas, there are just too many choices to deal with below average food."}
{"text":"I have to say the price for a burger is pricey ($13-$15). I have to say that when I took a bite into my burger I could taste the delicious taste of the grill and then I tasted all the flavors coming together so beautifully!  The best burger I have ever tried in my entire life. I've tried burgers from the east coast to the west coast and this deserves a five star rating with a magical rainbow. It was not just a burger but an experience! Defitnetly coming again!"}
{"text":"Had the hog burger it was so nice and juicy also had their union rings and man oh man and I stuffed after having a real deliciousness butterscotch pudding and banana shake it was to die for and the waitress was also good over all really good experience"}
{"text":"Great service, great burger. Can't say anything negative about our meal or experience. Would recommend and would return. Lives up to Gordon Ramsey quality and name."}
{"text":"The burger is average go to in n out for a cheaper burger with ketchup PS shake #2 and truffle fries are dank"}
{"text":"Really if I spend over $100 for a simple burger meal for 4 it should be spectacular and this was not.   Burger was tasty but dry, no sauce of any sort on the burgers, we ordered three different. The service was just adequate  I had high hopes, love burgers and this was my choice for birthday meal, and its Gordon Ramsey!  He spouts off about his greatness but it sure wasn't all that."}
{"text":"Forgot which burger I tried but I know it was pretty good. Nice presentation as well. Service was good. Would definitely try it again"}
{"text":"Great experience last night at Burgr. We were thoroughly impressed with the food and service. Our waiter, Ryan, did a fantastic job even though he was getting hammered with tables. We had an American burger which was awesome. The 28 day aged burger was the BEST I had ever had. It was cooked perfectly. We had the truffle fries which were amazing as well. We split Shake #4 and it was absolutely fantastic. We were thoroughly impressed with the entire visit and will be back in the future."}
{"text":"The hubs and I stopped by for a late lunch while carousing the strip.  We were in definite need of some fuel.  We surprisingly did not have much of a wait.  We both ordered the CA burgers, mine was a turkey patty,  along with fries.  The burgers were the best tasting burgers we ever had.  Very well seasoned.  The avocado, lettuce, and tomato was a great addition.  Well worth the price.   The \"ketchup\" was different like a BBQ version.    The fries were nice and crispy.  Overall well worth the money!"}
{"text":"I had the opportunity to visit the Gordon Ramsay BurGR during my last trip to Vegas.  I don't have much negative to say about the restaurant and the food. In fact, the only reason I haven't given the restaurant 5 stars is because of odd way we had to wait for a table.  First we waited in line to check in at the front to reserve a table and was told we would be notified by text when the table was ready.  After receiving the text that the table was ready, we had to stand in another long line to be seated.  Eventually, we agreed to be seated at the bar because it was just taking too long to get a blooming table. However, the food was worth the wait.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger medium rare which was awesome! Also shared some fries with my son and the dipping sauces were just delicious.  I highly recommend the restaurant, but be prepared to wait, especially if you visit the restaurant during the peak season such as Christmas or New Year's weeks."}
{"text":"I will start with a WOW!! this place is amazing, my family and I went to celebrate a birthday and the whole experience was great! Service was outstanding, our server was Ashley and she put so much attention to detail and always had an awesome attitude..another thing we noticed is that everybody working at this place looks like models, all great looking people!!  are we going back?? YES WE ARE...FOOD IS AMAZING, EVERYTHING COOKED TO PERFECTION!!"}
{"text":"We decided to have our New Year's Eve dinner here. It was really busy but just like in true Gordan Ramsey's fashion, everything ran like clockwork.  The place is nice. Decor's done up real good. However the food does fall short of my expectations.  The burgers were dry. For a medium / medium done patty it was actually really dry. And to be really honest here, it was totally nothing to wow about. The patties tasted 'meh' and I've had better hand made burgers elsewhere at half the prices they're charging.  Despite the terrible burgers, the starters we had were decent. The jalapeño poppers were pretty good and so were the wings. Truffle fries were a let down and also, I've had better.  Overall I expected more from a Gordan Ramsey restaurant. As far as my taste buds go, the quality of food here is just like any others normal burger joint and the \"GR\" brand is just a brand. If you're looking for damn good burgers, please go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My dad is obsessed with burgers and demanded that we eat at BurGR instead of Mon Ami Gabi; I'm not still not convinced that this was a good choice. My mother and I split the kale Caesar salad, which was my favorite part of the meal.  The dressing wasn't overly heavy and the apple complimented the bitterness of the kale, making it surprisingly palatable.  Even if you find kale to be the worst vegetable in the universe, which my mom and I do, you will probably enjoy this salad.  My dad and I had the farm burger, which my dad loved; I, however, did not.  The duck bacon that they put on top of the burger had a stringy consistency which made it hard to eat and activated my gag reflex.  The egg yolk had dripped all over my plate even before it made it to the table, making the bottom of an otherwise delightful bun soggy.  The burger itself was well-cooked, juicy, and flavorful.  All this combined made for an average burger.  My mom skipped the burger and ordered fish and chips instead.  I don't understand why it is served in giant sandwich roll which makes it impossible to eat unless you can unhinge your jaw.  She also said that the fish was bland and drenched it in ketchup to give it flavor. The service was good and the waitress was attentive however, she gave us the wrong drinks and then forgot to bring us water with lemon in it.  Overall, this was a disappointing experience and I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time here. I'm a fan of Gordon Ramsay so when I see this restaurant I'm so excited to try..start first off from the host. She tell me there's an hour 40 mnt waiting time. Since I'm a big fan .im willing to wait that long.when I came back after she still tell me I still have to wait another 40 mnt. Then after I wait ANOTHER 40 mnt. The hostess tell me just give her more 12 mnt. When I complain she finally had a table for us.But it's not just stop there. We finally got a table but yet no one acknowledge us..Waiting time for a burger 30 mnt.This review for the lack of service they had. If i can give a zero star I would.such disappointed experience!!"}
{"text":"This is a solid restaurant on the Vegas Strip. Warning it can get really busy and sometimes there is a line. However today I got right in with no wait .  This restaurant has plenty of seating in the dining room, bar or at the kitchen.  I ordered the American burger (subbed white cheddar and cooked onions).  The burger was delicious and I love that they use butter lettuce. So if you are expecting fries with your meal....you are out of luck. You have to order them separately and the portion is huge!   Overall I would visit again. Yeah you pay $15 for a burger... $7 for regular fries but this is Vegas. If you want a cheap burger go to McDonalds...but why would you want to."}
{"text":"On vacation from New York big Gordon Ramsey fan I was pressed for time the line was long I ordered takeout and lets just say ... my order was wrong I was missing onion rings which the waitress said I didn't order the burger was amazing as well as the truffle fries my lesson is stay at the restaurant and enjoy the meal if u can't then wait b"}
{"text":"Had the truffle fries and the farm burger. They were superb!"}
{"text":"Burger was excellent!  Cooked perfectly, juicy and lots of flavor!  Service was good.  Prices are what you expect from the area.  The line to get in moved quickly.  It was noisey, but so is the casino. I would go back and I recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"Well I am a big fan Chef Ramsey and his styles of food so I am biased, I had the pork burger, was a great spin a burger.  Truffle fries are a must get, and the chipotle ketchup was great as well.  The atmosphere is loud and modern, we enjoyed that.   The waitstaff was the part not quite up to par with what I would expect from a GR restaurant.  They could be a bit more attentive and less social with each other and pay attention to the customers.   The wait was fine, greeters were nice. Overall it's a $50-$75 burger trip, but the uniqueness and experience is worth it."}
{"text":"Been twice, first time was awesome, blew me away, egg on a burger....wonderful.  Second time, made us wait over an hour even though it was half full, food was just blah"}
{"text":"Wait time is ridiculous in the evening if you are just 2. Almost waited one hour after we got the seats. Staff need to learn hospitality. Wasted whole two hours on the strip."}
{"text":"First time here and totally loved it!  But a huge huge fan of burger (my hubby is), but I have to say this time: I love the juicy crunchy yummy farm burger!  We lined up for 30 min but it totally worth the time.  And plus the waitresses are very nice to us and helpful too!"}
{"text":"I have been here few times and had few of their choices.  *lines are pretty long, but worth the wait.  My favorite is the Euro burger adding an egg on it, Earth burger is pretty good too.  They are very busy and the place is always completely packed up, compare to how busy they are they keep pretty high service standards and employees are pretty nice.  Its not cheap for a burger, but you are in Vegas so its still cheap meal compare to most restaurants around.. For a Burger plus french fries plus drink would run around $30 a person not including the tip.  Ohhh the french fries very fresh as well and come with two delicious sauces."}
{"text":"The hype for this place is everywhere so I decided to check it out with some coworkers. It was absolutely hyped for a reason. One of the best places in Las Vegas to get a burger!  I ordered the Farm Burger. It was a sesame see toasted bun, with fried egg, english sharp cheddar, and duck breast bacon. It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth! The egg was cooked well and their was yolk in every delicious bite. The duck breast bacon good, but I expected it to be more savory. It's okay though because the burger made up for it!!  For appetizers we got parmesan truffle fries, jalapeno poppers, and wings. The truffle fries were the best out there. Lots of parmesan cheese and the best part of all was their house ketchup sauce. It worked amazing with the fries. The jalapeno poppers were good too. They came in a cheese sauce that cooled down the spice. The chef included seeds in one popper making it a game of roulette for which one had it. It came down to the last one! I split it with my coworker and it was spicy!  The wings I weren't a fan of. They bring out a duo, one more traditional buffalo and the other wasabi style. The cool thing is they scrape away some of the meat so you don't get your fingers very messy and can hold the wing by the bone. But unfortunately neither style of wings worked for me. The traditional had a good spice but it wasn't anything great. I took one bite of the wasabi and that was it. It wasn't spicy at all, but kind of sweet and it just didn't work for me at all.   All in all I plan to return and soon. The menu is decently priced, better than I was expecting. The food was amazing and I can truly say they do a burger right."}
{"text":"Awesome!! So good!! Had the Farm Burger. The meat was so flavorful and the duck bacon was out of this world! This is the best burger I have ever had. The bartender was attentive and talented. It was also refreshing to hear from staff that when Gordon Ramsey comes in, he'd gracious and nice. Absolutely can't say enough about this place and the burger!"}
{"text":"Fraîcheur et raffinement aux palais au rendez vous. Faites le si vous êtes un fin gastronome."}
{"text":"Visited BurGR during a recent business trip to Las Vegas.  It was one of the meals that I was most looking forward to.  Unfortunately, it failed me...at least partially.  Dining by myself this meal, I bypassed the line of waiting people and asked the hostess if I could simply sit at the bar, where there was one empty seat remaining.  She said Yes and soon I was being served by a very nice bartender.  While I was perusing the menu, I ordered an Angry Orchard Cider (the Crisp variety was on tap) and it was delicious!  For my meal, I chose the Parmesan Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings, which came with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip, and the Britannia Burger, described as being topped with English sharp cheddar, mango chutney, and arugula.  The restaurant was very busy, but even so the service was fairly prompt.  When my meal arrived, I first tried an onion ring and IT WAS AMAZING...by itself and with either of two dipping sauces!  Sadly, the burger was another thing entirely.  I took my first bite, expecting to receive a broad flavor of savory meat and cheese, spicy arugula, and sweet mango chutney.  Well, the savory and the spicy were there, but there was no sweetness whatsoever.  Confused, I put down the burger, removed the top, and found nothing that resembled chutney.  I called over the bartender, explained the situation, and she offered to either bring me a small dish of chutney or have them make me a new burger entirely, this time with the chutney included.  I chose the former, but what she brought me, in my opinion, could scarcely be called a \"chutney\".  When I think of a chutney, I think of a mixture of diced fruits and spices that retain some semblance of solidity.  What I got was thin, runny, and had maybe two very thin slices of something that may have been a fruit at some point.  I dipped a finger, tasted it, and it was sweet, so I poured it atop my hamburger patty.  Sadly, as I lifted the burger and took a bite, much of the thin liquid substance leaked out the sides, affecting the overall flavor of the burger very little.  The burger was still good, not great, but good, so I went ahead and finished it without further comment to the bartender.  Had it not been for the saving grace of those onion rings, this meal would have been a disaster, especially given the price of the burger.  So, my advice, get the onion rings and if you are considering the Britannia Burger, then make sure that they have improved the chutney before ordering.  That said, if you are craving a good burger on the Strip, then I highly recommend Fukuburger within Fame in the Linq; but better yet, if you can get off Strip, then go to Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed especially cause I was looking at Instagram photos of there burgers all week long ! My waitress was great that's for sure .. The two stars are for the restaurant I give the waitress 5 stars for taking my cold burger back and making sure it was hot the second time around . Another thing was the fries were horrible and o love fries , but they had no flavor at all . This place is good but need a lot of improvement and should start with management , and then the cooks . The cooks are just messing around and not paying attention . I sat directly in front of them so everything coming out there mouth was just as bad as there cooking . I hope this place can improve soon , I'd really like to enjoy the meal next time ."}
{"text":"So many good things to say about BurGR. Let's start with the food. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger on my first visit and was not disappointed. My first time at BurGR was so great, I had to go back the next day. During my 2nd visit, I had the Euro Burger. Although I prefer the Hell's Kitchen burger more, the Euro Burger will not disappoint you. I thought the size of the burger was just perfect, you can enjoy eating with your hands (which is the right way of eating burgers, really). I'm one of the odd ones that like their meat well done (someone said it's a Filipino thing) - some joints tend to overcook the meat when you request it well done, BurGR doesn't. The menu price at BurGR is also really good and reasonable. I enjoyed a couple of bucks off since I was a Total Rewards member. The service was reasonably quick considering the amount of people dining at the restaurant. I really can't wait to go back to this place and bring my 5 year old niece who likes burgers just like me. The 5 spiced chicken wings look awesome - I only wish I had two stomachs so I can eat the other stuff here. I would skip the onion rings and truffle fries though if you don't want the extra calories. Can't wait to go back again. Really good place."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place.  First off, it was well organized.  Being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, it was understandably busy.  There was a long line of people waiting, but we gave the attendant our information and they let us know that we would get a message when our table was ready.  So we were free to wander around as long as we could be back to the restaurant within 10 minutes of getting the text that our table was ready.    We started out with Jalapeno Poppers (and I was the lucky one to get the surprise super hot one... wow...) and the Fury Chicken Wings.  Both appetizers were fiery and delicious.  I then tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Truffle Fries.  The burger was good, but the fries were amazing.  I have never tasted anything as delicious in my entire life.  I had never tasted truffle before so I am not sure if it is always so amazing, but I am completely in love with those fries.  If I could eat them every day, I would probably weigh 400lbs... Good thing I do not live in Las Vegas!  My friends tried the Gordon Ramsay Burger (which was not listed on the menu).  They liked the burger, but it was more expensive than any of the burgers listed on the menu, so just be aware of that going in.  It was $19 where as other burgers are $13-$16.  The Jalapeno Margarita was also pretty tasty, but $14 a pop is pretty pricey."}
{"text":"I am salivating as I write this review.  This place is Omg so good!  Between four girls, we shared the following plates:  Honey pig Bao buns: yum!!!  Hell's Kitchen burger: not over powerfully hot, just the right amount of heat, perfect paired with their sweet potato fries Chanterelle burger: amazing!  Chocolate hazelnut pudding and coffee shake: fantastic! Sticky toffee pudding push ups: it was good, not exactly a fan, but good nonetheless  Great atmosphere, impeccable service, and the food is nothing short of excellent!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We waited 40 minutes for our food. The parmesan fries were pretty good. The cheeseburger I received was very dry and not satisfying at all. My husband ordered the cod sandwich and he was not very impressed. If these are supposed to be gourmet hamburgers they need to taste like gourmet hamburgers. We plan to not eat here again. Should've just went to Applebee's or Chilis for a hamburger. We expected better especially from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and price was outrageous for cheeseburgers. We couldn't carry on a conversation since the restaurant was so noisy."}
{"text":"Came by to try the burgers at Planet Hollywood Hotel after watching KA at MGM. Not sure if it was worth the trip to be honest. Burgers were not as tasty as I had expected, perhaps my expectations were too high. Perhaps it was the choice of burger too, had the American burger - was nothing to shout about, kinda tastes like the super duper burger I had a couple of weeks back. Maybe I'll come back to try the other burgers if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is gourmet burger style. I had the Hells Kitchen Burger, its very tasty. They claim to grill the meat patty over smoldering logs, they probably did because I can taste it. As for the portion size of the burger , don't expect quantity but quality.   You must also order the jalapeño poppers here. The best I ever had. They are panko breaded and and served individually in a container halfway dipped in cheddar ranch sauce. The best ever. Truly orgasmic flavor combination! I ended up asking for a a side of that cheddar ranch , and was drizzling it on my burger.   Well as for the dining experience. There is a wait (maybe 20 to 30 min.) and It gets loud and busy. For the price? it can get expensive for burger and poppers. But its gourmet I guess."}
{"text":"Yelp defines the five star rating as something that is \"as good as it gets\", and Gordon Ramsay's BurGR absolutely fits that description. I will go out of my way to try and find a great burger, and I've had some awesome ones, but the ones I had here were some of the very best I've ever had anywhere. Ever.  First impressions: Being in Vegas it's got that upscale feel to it. We had a short line when we got there, about a 15 min. wait, and the giant interactive menu on the wall is sweet. The bar is very cool with the ice wall behind the taps, and the open kitchen and the flames along the walls are nice eye candy.  Service: Service was excellent! The bartenders were great and our server was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and attentive. Love the iPad that you get that shows the drink list and gives descriptions. Draft selection was small but had a nice variety and great quality beers.  Food: We ordered the Farm burger, Euro burger and the Brittania, and they were every bit as amazing as I was hoping they'd be. The burger patties themselves were out of this world. Cooked perfectly to order. Moist and tender on the inside, and a phenomenal mouthfeel and chew. The blend of cuts was awesome, and the texture of the short rib in particular was stellar. The natural taste of the beef really shined through, and the fact that they're grilled over a wood fire gives them an added depth of flavor that you just can't get with a plain gas grill like most other burger restaurants use.  A burger patty should be good enough that you could eat it on its own, with any sauces or toppings only serving to compliment the protein, and that was definitely the case here.  The Farm burger with its duck bacon and quail egg was ridiculously delicious. The Brittania with the mango chutney had a nice sweetness to it. My personal favorite was the Euro burger. The goat cheese and truffle aioli just sent the burger over the top. In each burger the different flavors were perfectly balanced.  The jalapeno poppers were really good, as were the onion rings. The chipotle ketchup that came with the rings was particularly tasty. I wish I could've brought a bottle of that stuff home with me.  Is it more expensive than most other burgers? Yes. Is it overpriced? No. Could you find bigger, heavier burgers? Yes. Is it any less satisfying? No.  Some people have this idea that the more a burger costs, the bigger it should be. Uh, no. The more it costs the BETTER it should be. If all you want to do is pinch pennies and get the biggest burger possible for your money, walk down the street to Fatburger, or find some fast food chain. But you get what you pay for, so if you want quality, if you want the absolute best burger in Vegas, and certainly one of the best anywhere, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is the place to be.  I'm just gonna say it... there are a lot of reviews by people saying the burgers are just okay, or nothing special, etc. Those people have no idea what they're talking about."}
{"text":"Food is really really really good ! However, the service here is terrible. They don't let you sit at the bar that is open. They make you wait in this big huge line for 45 minutes just to sit you at the open bar when you get to the front of the line. When you ask the hostesses about it they are extremely rude."}
{"text":"Mr Ramsey I think you are a phenomanal chef and I am a big fan , but I am dissapointed with Burgr . Using your words here is a short review  I don't want to blow smoke up your A ... 3 words for you , In N Out !!!!! Fries over seasoned , Burgers under seasoned. Shake chalky . Service and ambience good. Listen to joe Bastianich and get rid of the truffle oil. On the whole a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Excellent, Fantastic,  better than I anticipated. The burger I ordered was the best I ever had, my husband ordered a shake and oh my, words can't even describe the goodness!"}
{"text":"We got in line before they opened for lunch so we got right in. Our server was attentive and explained the menu and drinks available. She let us know that the burgers take a bit of time to cook so we ordered the truffle fries and sweet potato fries well we waited. They were up right away with our drinks and were seasoned deliciously!  The vanilla powdered sugar topping was a great addition to the sweet potato fries. My husband and I couldn't decide between burgers so we split the Hell's Kitchen burger and Brittania burger and both were huge and cooked perfectly. The mango chutney on the burger added a great flavor. We were able to keep our menus which was a great touch for 3 Hell's Kitchen die hard fans. Next time we are in Vegas we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My experience at Burgr was positive with the exception of a few things. Let me start by complimenting the interior, it was contemporary and comfortable. The menu was very simple and detailed, definitely a plus. My friend and I had a few things on the menu. The truffle fries were divine, then again truffles can make anything amazing. I highly recommend their truffle fries! The steamed pork buns were very mediocre. The pork was tougher than I expected it to be. The burger though, flawless! I had the euro burger and it was really good. It's definitely something I would come back for. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and every component complimented each other. They also had a good selection on beers, which is always a winner! Their customer service was not the best though. Every time they would take our food to us, the would put another guest's plate (even our drinks) to make it easier for them to put our down. Trays exist, maybe they should look in to getting those. When they would take our empty plates, they would slam an empty plate from another table on top our empty plate and take both plates. It was very unethical and such a turn off. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu but seemed bored and put off a vibe like she had better things to do. Again, such a turn off. Overall, it was okay. It's not my favorite but I would definitely come back (for those truffle fries. yum)"}
{"text":"Quite an over rated restaurant, we ordered a truffle burger which was quite nice, but the chilli hot dog is very salty. And the truffle chips is quite nice but not worth $11. If you are prepare to pay $20 for a burger, Then go for it."}
{"text":"As Gordon Ramsey would say: Incredible.  Excellent, fast service (even though every table was filled). I got the Oreo shake and my wife got the chocolate...both exceptional. We then got the farm burger and Hell's kitchen burger.   Both burgers were a perfect medium rare. The farm burger has an excellent, savory flavor with the duck breast bacon and the oozy, tasty fried egg. My wife's burger had just the right amount of heat without being too spicy to enjoy.   Like everyone says, the truffle aioli fries are to die for.   Highly recommended from a happy, full giant (6'7\"). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If you're going to Vegas, you have to go to BurGR, they said.  It's the best burger I've had in my life, they said.  I'm nearly 40, I've eaten an awful lot of burgers in my lifetime and I have the bulging midsection to prove it.  But, well, when you're in Vegas it's a time to indulge and try new things, right?  So I followed along with a small group of friends and we decided to give Gordon Ramsay's burger joint a go.  It's located in Planet Hollywood which isn't my favorite casino on the strip - a little on the loud side - but it's sufficiently far from the casino floor that the noise levels in the restaurant are acceptable.  They've definitely got this fire vibe going on, from the wavy flame display to the flames on the walls and on the menus and ... well, of course, there's images of Ramsay himself, arms folded over his chest as he looms over you, steely eyes boring holes into your soul.  Like he's judging.  Are you worthy to enter this restaurant?  Are you going to pick the right item from the menu?    Then the line moves along and you remember it's just a display.  The wait wasn't too bad, though it was late on a Sunday night.  I can see how the line might get a little more onerous at other times.  The staff were doing this odd bit of sorting the line by party size and creating a bit of confusion but before long we were seated and menus were in our hands.  You open them up and Ramsay is there again, but this time his demeanor has changed.  Friendly, welcoming, almost jubilant!  As if to say \"You came to my restaurant, you aren't one of the simpering idiots are you?  Look inside!  See what we have to offer!\"    The menu isn't too big or overwhelming, but there's a decent selection of burgers (as well as pork and chicken sandwiches for those so inclined) and sides.  I selected the Farm Burger, which comes with cheddar cheese, duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  The group selected the parmesan truffle fries and wings as sides.  It didn't take long for the food to arrive, and we dug in.  The wings were delightful.  A nice flavor, not too spicy, but enough heat to keep them interesting.  Crispy without being overly heavy on the breading.  Not the best chicken wing on the planet, but then again this is BurGR and not WinGS.  Good stuff.  The fries were delicious and the portion was generous.  We were worried whether a single order of fries was going to cut it for the table but in the end we only just finished them.  The truffle oil is not overwhelming and adds a great flavor to the fries, and pairs very well with the parmesan. The fries are served in these inverted cones which means the bottom fries wind up being a little buried in parmesan cheese which overpowers the flavor if you don't shake off the excess.  No big deal.  Now on to the star of the show, the main attraction, the burger.  It arrived looking good but unassuming, distinguished only by the salt-and-pepper appearance of the black and white sesame seeds on the bun, the hints of fried egg peeking out, and the ends of the bacon making like points of the compass.  It was a little big to handle all in one go without getting messy so I cut it into halves.  When I separated the halves of my burger I saw ... pink.  Stop the presses - this burger was cooked medium rare, and I had ordered it ... medium rare.  Perhaps not a singular feat worthy of bestowing the title \"best burger ever\", but a sign of competence on the part of the staff.  Clearly these were no mean fry cooks behind the counter, but men and women attuned to their craft enough to know what medium rare means.  Perhaps it is the fear of a verbal beatdown, of being called all sorts of unflattering names should Mr. Ramsay discover his employees are under or overcooking the food.  No need for another \"It's Raw\" meme here.  Even the egg was fried up just right, soft enough that the yolk oozed out and permeated the burger, but cooked enough that i wasn't left holding a soggy bun.  Sure, it looked good, but what about taste?  I've had $15 burgers before from hip, trendy joints with whimsical themes and ironic logos that failed to surpass the flavor of a Whopper (or at least a Whopper on a good day) and left me feeling cheated.  For $15 I expect a burger that is going to impress, a burger that is going to leave me enjoying every bite, a burger that I'm going to eat slowly so as to enjoy every last morsel before it is gone ... in short, THIS burger. Juicy and perfectly seasoned.  There was just the right amount of cheese that the sharp cheddar added a delightful tang to each bite.  The duck breast bacon was also in perfect balance, adding its own saltiness and flavor without overpowering the taste of the burger itself. The egg yolk smoothed it all out.  Delicious.  I've given it a day and some to make sure I wasn't overselling it in my mind, trying to justify spending $15 on a burger.  Best burger ever?  Maybe.  Best burger in a long time?  Yes.  Do yourself a favor and try it next time you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great wings, but the burger patty was overly salty. And I know salty...I use Tabasco sauce almost everyday."}
{"text":"Meh, ok, not great.  We had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, Truffle Burger, Chanterelle Burger, and Hog Burger.  Note that the burgers are 7oz - for 15 bucks!  Everyone at the table mentioned that they would enjoy a double double more than the burgers.  The Hog Burger was the best of them.  The truffle fries were basically garlic fries.  Not a repeat and the service was incredibly slow - and it wasn't a hugely busy day."}
{"text":"Did I eat at the same restaurant as everyone else? I am SHOCKED by the glowing reviews. Burger was tasteless, bland, and had no condiments on it- just butter on the bun. Fine, if you're going to do that, at least provide some ketchup when you drop off the burger. Kale Caesar- ughhhhh... no. Just don't do it. I don't know what kind of dressing was on that salad, but it wasn't like any kind of Caesar dressing I've ever tasted.  Truffle Fries- these were fine. Everyone does truffle fries though, so these were nothing special. The ketchup tastes homemade and a lot like marinara sauce, which was kind of a fun twist. Milkshakes- these were ok. We had two different ones and while they are nothing to rave about (I saw all of those pints of Haagen Dazs in your reach-in freezer, good to know that I can make these at home) it was just OK. I've had better milkshakes at In N Out Burger or Dick's Drive In.  I did appreciate that they seated us right away (pregnant lady right here) instead of making us wait in line. And service was super friendly. So there's that."}
{"text":"Been here twice, the onion rings are insanely good! The burgers are mehhh...really dry and plain. If your stuck on the strip though and don't want to pay a fortune for food but want a nice restaurant to chill at it's good for that. But if your looking for an amazing burger go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Best Classic burger Ive ever had!!  I'm a huge in n out fan, and search the world for the best gourmet burgers.  This was hands down AMAZING. -Juicy, perfect amount of cheese and seasoning.  I loved Gordon already, but he knows his BurGR!"}
{"text":"A bits late getting this review in, just got tied up. Wait time was long but to be expected I suppose. Food was great, service is great also. Their presentations is clean and fits perfectly. The Parmesan fries were very good, a bit to much Parmesan cheese for my liking, but nonetheless very good. Sweet potato fries were fantastic and I really have not cared much for sweet potato fries from other places, kudos for the powdered sugar served with them. Ate there on Father's Day and will go back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not sure how much Chef Ramsey is actually involved with this joint but it's quite good.  Open, inviting ambiance and nice modern decor.  The wall of flame is is a nice touch.  Decent beer selection.  Good service.    Get the buff wings.  They're 5 star.  The jalapeño poppers are worth a try as well.  Try both fries.  The truffle fries were my fave.  I typically don't like sweet potato fries but theirs changed my outlook.  They're finished with a vanilla powder and paired with a honey jalapeño aioli (fancy word for mayo).  Pretty darn good.    Now the burgers.  Seriously, one of the better ones I've ever had.  The one I got was called the farm yard I think.  Damn tasty.  High quality ingredients from the bun to the ground beef.  The one I devoured had duck bacon and a fried egg and was extra cheesy.   Overall, a bit pricey for burgers and fries but you're on the strip and you should pay more for high quality.  The only reason this isn't a 5 star is because of service.  Although our server was really great...made great suggestions, knowledgeable, super friendly, fun and she put up with our antics...The service at the bar was not good at all.  While waiting for our table, we went to the bar to grab a beer and the 2 bartenders were more concerned with talking with each other rather than talking to and serving guests at the bar.  Took almost 5 mins just to be acknowledged and they weren't that busy at all.  I'll be back though. We'll just bring a beer with before checking in at the Host stand  :-)"}
{"text":"Well done Gordon Ramsay! He never fails to impress me. I went to Burgr with my husband to check out the food and the service because I really like Gordon Ramsay's work ethic and his food. First of all the decor and everything was super cool and impressive. Very simple and easy to choose menu with a picture of Gordon on the back. The clothes/uniforms that the servers wearing were also cool. Dark denim jeans and button up shirts for the guys and full zipper short tight dresses for the girls. Very hip and young staff. I ordered the euro burger and my husband ordered one of their foot long hot dogs.  5-7 mins later our orders are in front of us and we were really impressed by the quick and friendly service. I ordered my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. We also ordered the sweet potato fries which comes with a light creamy sauce and powdered sugar. It was also pretty good. The only thing thing that amazed me was the manager actually came to our table and asked us about the food and how we were doing, is there anything that she can do for us. When you get a treatment like this at a restaurant even if you ordered some fries and burgers, you actually feel very appreciated for choosing them and being their customer. Young staff, great food, excellent service I give this restaurant 5 starts! Definitely try and go here.  P.S; The restaurant is inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel on the strip."}
{"text":"Just arrived in Las Vegas!  Have an hour before a meeting and saw Gordon Ramsay's advert at the airport baggage claim.  Ok...nice advertising, so decided to check it out with colleague.  Lots of buzz around the restaurant.  Lots of beer on tap, a little heavy in the merchandising, however, good seating options nicely laid out menu.  Starting out with roasted jalapeño poppers.  This is an interesting take on a pooper, made up with cheddar bacon, cheddar ranch and what they tout as \"one fiery surprise\"...!  Next up was the Euro Burger, which had a very nice truffle aioli, with additions of arugula, goat cheese, and oven roasted tomatoes.  And let's not forget the Maui onion rings...crispy with great dipping sauces...Nice finish!"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for burger. Nobody bothered to apologize or ask how are we doing. When it finally arrived it was cold and super dry (I asked for medium and got well done). Very disappointing. Don't go"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about the food, it was amazing!! The server was very nice, the only negative was we had a party of 8 an we had to separate the tables an the hostess was a little snotty about the whole thing. Get some new front service an it would be a 10/5!!"}
{"text":"Sat at Ramsey's room ! Great service super friendly our waitress was awesome ! Would come back in a heart beat !"}
{"text":"Seriously? 4 star average out of 1515 Yelpers? I guess most of the peeps giving the BurGR 4 stars are used to eating leftovers or frozen microwave foods. I don't mind standing in line for 30 mins on a Tuesday night at 8:30 pm. I don't mind waiting 45 minutes for the burger everyone loves the Farm burger.. Just prove me it's worth the wait.   It doesn't even taste on the level of Cheesecake Factory's burger which is $4 cheaper! After being able to seat then waited 45 minutes! Really? For a burger that they just added sunny side up egg and duck bacon? Their lucky they don't hire chubby waitresses. The servers gave great customer service so far. But for an ordinary burger like the Farm burger and Hells kitchen burger. Don't waste your time. They weren't even warm when it got to us.  My nephew who ordered the Hells Kitchen burger which is supposed to be hot or spicy that I recommended according to \"Yelp reviews,\" told me it's not even hot and it tasted ordinary LOL! One common word to describe..Overrated."}
{"text":"Ramsay's BurGR is hands down the best burger restaurant I've eaten at in Vegas. One word of caution, BurGR does not take reservations, so expect a long wait. We went on a Saturday night and had about an hour and 20 minute wait. They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready, so you can walk around the casino or the miracle mile shops while you're waiting.  Now on to the food:  Fries and Onion Rings - We were really hungry, so we did an order of the truffle fries and the onion rings as appetizers.  The fries are thick and hand-cut, I usually prefer thinner fries but these were very good.  Plus, they came with a killer truffle aioli sauce that was simply amazing.  The aioli was so good that my wife asked for a side of it to put on her burger.  The onion rings were beer-battered and almost tempura-style, so they were nice and crispy.  The maui onions gave them a good flavor and they came with a tasty homemade ranch sauce.  Burgers - Per our server's recommendation, I had the Farm burger (duck bacon, cheddar, fried egg) and it was amazing.  The meat was juicy and a perfect pink medium throughout, the fried egg was runny and just added to the juiciness of the burger.  The duck bacon added a nice flavor, it tasted a bit like pastrami.    My wife had the Chanterelle, which came smothered in a delicious onion jam.    Shakes & Dessert - The shakes here are very unique as the come with pudding as the top layer.  It's an interesting combination that just works, our Shake #1 (caramel pudding & chocolate ice cream) was so good I wanted another one!  For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding pops, which I would not get again.  They come with a peanut ice cream that is extremely peanutty and kind of overwhelming.  The sticky toffee is frozen and chewy and doesn't really have any flavor at all.  I would definitely skip the toffee pops and stick with the shakes.    Service was good throughout our meal, and we even had a manager stop by and chat with us for a few minutes.  Overall it was a fantastic experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone that loves burgers."}
{"text":"I considered giving this place two stars because our server Tammy was hilarious and the milkshake I ordered was amazing (shake + pudding=genius) but we didn't come for the service or the shakes...  Obviously, we waited an hour and a half to get into Burgr to sample Gordon Ramsay's version of this American Classic.  We went with the Hog Burger, sold to us as \"GR's most famous\" burger. It was terrible. The meat had an odd, almost raw texture. There was little in the way of flavor apart from a strange one no one could identify.  I have to imagine even Chef Ramsay himself would've tossed this one in the trash.    I love burgers. And I love trying new restaurants. But this one was a huge disappointment and a colossal waste of cash."}
{"text":"Awesome burger better than Bobby Flay!!!!!!!!!!! The only thing better, if Gordon Ramsey was there!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Wait was about 20 minutes which wasn't bad. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my friend got the Hog's Burger, both were super delish. Burger was nice and juicy full of flavor. We also got a side of onion rings which were probably the best onion rings I've ever had."}
{"text":"First time here! & it was amazing!! The wait wasn't bad. Estimated wait for 4 on a Sunday night was about an hour. What's cool was that they'll get your # & text you when your table is ready. I wouldn't recommend going too far just in case you miss your reservations.   The manager, Benji & our server, Alex (w/glasses) was hilarious!! They definitely made our experience very enjoyable. The food was amazing! We had the farm & Hell's Kitchen burger, fish & crisp, truffle parmesan fries, maui onion rings, & jalapeño poppers. Jalapeño poppers are a must! Forgot the name of the beer, but it tasted just like fruity pebbles!! They'll know exactly what beer it is if you mention fruity pebbles.  It's a must try too. Must eat at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr & ask for Alex!!  I'd definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I was really looking forward to this place. My boyfriend took our friend from Malibu, California and I to this place and the wait was an hour and thirty minutes. I always knew there was a wait so that was of no concern. An hour and ten minutes later we tried to check in and apparently they did text us, but sometimes the system \"doesn't work\". Luckily, we checked in. The server was very nice, but the busser was extremely helpful. Now, the food runner was extremely rude to my boyfriend when he asked which burger was which. The manager never stopped once;  though it was a question on the review they hand out after your meal.   What got me the most was the fact that their burger was nothing special. The meat was dry and the parmesan truffle fries were very hard. The sweet potato fries were ok though.   Just came home and my stomach is really hurting. I am thinking my meat was undercook.   Overall, go for the experience, but I definetely wouldn't go back. All the employees looked miserable."}
{"text":"First time visiting a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. My friend and I figured after seeing his shows and ratings as a chef that his employees and cooks would be at a different level. Definitely not!   Wait - No wait at all very prompt to get our table.   Pre-Ordering food - Our waitress showed us the drink menu on an iPad (pretty cool) and gave us enough time to make up our mind.  Ordering food - I asked specifically if the Damnation Chicken Burger was spicy and if I could have it with a normal beef patty. Our waitress said it had a good kick considering it had \"fiery hot mayo\". I love a good spicy burger so I ordered that. We also got truffle fries, onion rings, and the farm burger.   To start we got our food in a decent amount of time, slightly longer than expected but nothing to bad.  First my onion rings never came. I asked when they dropped off the food and it wasn't our waitress who dropped off the food. The women said she'd go ask them to make them but they never came at all.  The truffle fries (which our waitress said were \"well worth the few bucks extra, they are so much better) were a huge disappointment. When it says \"truffle Parmesan\" and \"truffle salt\" they mean they lightly sprinkle it on the top of the normal fries and charge $3 extra.  Solid tasting fries but we wanted the normal ones and she really pushed us to get truffle fries and they weren't worth it at all.  My burger was the damnation burger. It had no spice at all! I don't know if they forgot the \"fiery hot mayo\" or what but it was bland. It had no flavor at all. Realistically the bun was the only part that was good. If the burger was spicy like promised and had a little more flavor it would've been nice but honestly you get more taste from Carl's Jr. I would never, ever recommend getting this burger. I asked one of the guys working there if it was supposed to be spicy he said yes, and asked if it was to hot for me. I said no, it had no spice at all and he quickly back tracked his comments saying it's only supposed to be a small but noticeable kick. 1 out of 5 stars burger which is incredibly disappointing.  The farm burger wasn't much better. The burger patty itself was dry and it didn't have much flavor. My friend asked for Ketchup and some of their \"cheesy ranch\" or whatever it's called just so he could dunk the burger in it to add some flavor. We had to ask three (3) times just to get a side of cheesy ranch as well. About 10 minutes after getting it another waitress we asked came and dropped it off and saw that we had already got someone so she basically dropped it on the plate and stormed off, rude.   Now not everything was terrible one waiter or busboy in particular was prompt, helpful and overall did his job well was named Joey. Not sure on spelling but had to ask his name, if anyone from Burgr management actually reads this review he was the only bright spot in an overall terrible experience. We spent about $48 on food and service that was more worth about $15 or less.  Honestly Ramsey should start paying attention to his own portfolio of restaurants before filming tv shows about fixing other peoples restaurants."}
{"text":"Farmhouse burger was absolutely amazing! I also tried the Truffle burger and neither of these disappointed.  Also the Gooey Fries were awesome too. This was the most money I have ever paid at a burger joint but then again I've never had such perfectly crafted burgers like these either. Especially the buns which were to die for."}
{"text":"Not that good, VERY Slow service, took forever to get our food, what a disappointment was not worth the wait"}
{"text":"BF and I were excited to try our first Gordon Ramsay restaurant and were not surprised that there was a long line waiting to get seated for Gordon Ramsay's BurGR on a Friday evening. We waited around an hour and finally got a table. From the Yelp reviews, BF already knew he wanted to try the Farm Burger ($15) and truffle fries ($11). I ordered the Chanterelle Burger ($16).  Our food came out fairly quickly and we were ready to eat. The Chanterelle Burger was too sweet for my liking. The Farm Burger lived up to the hype, but before BF could take a bite, the yolk exploded all over the plate. The truffle fries and truffle aioli were delicious!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, plain, simple burgers that took forever to arrive. The fries were fine, but also overpriced. This place seems to be a fad, lots of people waiting in line, presumably they, like us, also thought it was gonna be good. We had to wait an hour to be seated, we were expecting at least an average meal. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.  Great lighting, bunch of tvs for sports, decent food and the price was relatively cheap considering it is in Las Vegas.  I got the farm burger and it was pretty good.  It's hard for me to say a burger is amazing because in the end it's a burger but it was well made and very good.  The fries were terrible though.  It was dry, plasticy, and not very tasty.  The onions rings were pretty good with the cheddar cheese ranch sauce.  What made the meal great was the milkshake.  I'm not big into milkshakes but it was by far the best I ever had.  Texture was perfect in which it was not runny or too thick to drink through a straw and it was a good balance of not too sweet and not too foofy (considering it's a trendy place).  I'd go back here again if I'm in the area.  I'm not sure though if I would go out of my way to come here if I was staying at a hotel/casino far away on the other side of the strip."}
{"text":"First the Burger.... Very Good! The meat is flavourful and charbroiled over wood. It was perfectly cooked to order (medium). The toppings were perfect. The bun looks good but I found it \"airy\" I would have preferred a softer denser bun. Certainly one of the best burger around.  Now the bad... if Gordon Ramsay would have tasted my fries in one of his TV show, he would have turned them away and say the were hard as cardboard. I know the Brits call them chips... and that's exactly what they felt like (crisps for you Gordon). I can say that the taste was good; they just have been put in the frier too many times. Now that I had the chance to see some yelp pictures I assumed that it was an isolated case; but for $8. and coming from a restaurant that bares the name of a Michelin Chef I would have expected higher standards.  The service was excellent and my waitress very friendly."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed.  I expected fresh healthy ingredients from a restaurant with a chef attached to it.  Truffle fries were dry.  Home made ketchup had corn syrup.  Jalapeño margarita did not have fresh lime.  Avocado on burger was brown.  Burger had no flavor.  This felt like a chain that I want to avoid."}
{"text":"Pease read, it gets better - Was really looking forward to a Burger at Chef Ramsey's place, but was surprisingly met with disappointment. The wait was 45 minutes for a Burger that did not meet the hype. Felt like a glorified fast food restaurant. I will not be going back. BTW had an excellent experience and Burger at Wolfgang in the MGM! Peace."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was good , burger was overpriced but tasted fine no complaint. The food service was realy slow,more than half an hour also with the slot so close to the table was an agony waiting because every few minute a hungry costumer bumped into me to reach the machine to play with no food on his table."}
{"text":"Lots of hype about the burgers here. I have to say I actually liked the milkshake the best of the meal. The chocolate shake with pudding on top was excellent! The burger was also very tasty, unique and strong flavor. I may prefer something a bit more mild, however I still enjoyed. The truffle fries aoli was excellent, however I would have preferred if there wasn't truffle oil drizzled on the fries as the flavor was a bit overpowering.   Overall, I'd go again and I'd recommend it to someone else. I would also try and compare this burger to Umami and Shake Shake and see how they compare in the future."}
{"text":"Best burger place hands down! From taste to texture everything was perfect! We came right when they opened at 11a and got a seat right away. Service was good. We got the Hells Kitchen burger, Euro burger, truffle fries and onion rings. It can be a bit pricey but when you're getting high quality food its 100% worth it. I wouldve paid double for this food. Yum! Yum! Yum!"}
{"text":"The ambience is awesome. The food is awesome as well. The service is awesome as well. Lives up to the hype. The only reason I gave a 4 is because of the 30 minute wait to get in. But just an occupational hazard I guess."}
{"text":"First visit to BurGR & it will NOT be my last!! Love Gordon Ramsay & wanted to try someplace new in Vegas!!! BurGR met all my expectations & more!!! The truffle fries & beer battered onion rings were AMAZING & the burgers were perfectly cooked & melted in your mouth!!! The Acai Lemonade drink was phenomenal & wasn't too overpowering with alcohol!!! Great & fast service, great food & atmosphere & was able to see Hells Kitchen winner, Christina in the kitchen (an added bonus being a Hells Kitchen lover!!)  Tip - get there as early as possible because there's always a long line to get in!"}
{"text":"Going to start off by saying, I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, been to a few of his places before and always have been excellent.   Unfortunately this is not one of those places,  sat and waited 30 mins just to get our drinks, got our order taken, never saw the waitress again until we got out check.  The burger we order we overcooked had to get it redone, had to track down and eventually went and got our own refills, since we never saw our waitress again. Overall I will probably not come back, I'll go Red Robin instead.  The 2 couples beside us after speaking to them eventually just walked out and left disappointed with the service as well"}
{"text":"Was here with a group of 4, it was truly an incredible burger.  However, the other diners I was with had some of the specialty burger (one with the chantrelles) and they were just ok. The pork belly buns were nice, but the buffalo wings were a tad on the vinegary side. The line is often quite long, but so long as you get the classic american burger and not the fancy stuff, it's superb, and that's what my review is based on."}
{"text":"My Hell's Kitchen burger was the most delicious burger I have had in my entire life even my sister ate it and she is very picky the avocado was delicious and cheese was just marvelous."}
{"text":"Awesome burger, awesome fries. Awesome cocktails.   Definitely try this restaurant while in Vegas. The price is reasonable for the quality.  The hostess was friendly.   Awesome place."}
{"text":"Best Burger And Fries Ever! Excellent Service!! Great beer too! Totally recommend you come here!!!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about this place from my friends. So when I was in vegas we decided to stop by and give it a try. The service was great! We were greeted and seated fast, our waitress was very helpful and attentive. Our food came out at a good pace. We started with the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers, Truffle Parmasan Fries, and the Maui Onion Rings. THOSE WERE DELICIOUS!!! All were so crunchy and packed with flavor!!! They were served with this cheddar ranch sauce that just upped the flavor also! I highly recommend getting it when you visit! My husband ordered the Euro Burger and loved it! Normally he doesn't eat goat cheese, but he was going to town with his burger hahaha he kept talking about how delicious and perfectly season the meat was and how it goes so well with the goat cheese. I should have tried it hahaha... My son ordered the Farm burger it had duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar cheese, and a fried egg... He loved it! He even wanted to go back the next day to eat again... hahaha... I got the Chanterelle Burger, it had mushrooms, arugala, and fig jam... it was very good... but I didn't get the same OMG its delicious factor like my guys did... hahaha... I felt like I should have ordered something else. The meat was seasoned perfectly on my burger but I guess the mushroom flavor just a bit too strong for me. For dessert we ordered a shake... we got the Creme Brulee with Oreo cookies shake... Brace yourself... for the best shake in your life!!! IT WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!!! I know it sounds like it would be super sweet, but to my surprise it wasn't as sweet as I expected. The creme brulee part had pieces of the crunchy topping mixed into it and so did the oreo portion... At this point my son was fighting off severe food coma... he had eaten so much hahaha... he took a few sips of the shake and that was the perfect ending to his night before he knocked out sleeping at the restaurant... haha ... what is a mother to do besides finish off his shake LOL... LISTEN... if we were there and he fell asleep again... i would finish it off again! LOL... Over all this place is delicious!!! I would recommend it to any of my friends!!! I can't wait to go back to vegas just eat here again!"}
{"text":"Seemingly popular with the 20-somethings with long lines in the evening, we stopped in BurGR for a late lunch and it seems GR is living on his celebrity, not his cooking or service.  It took 35 minutes to get two burgers and an order of sweet potato fries to the table - cold.  The burgers were absolutely nothing special - except very expensive.  The ground beef was fresh but had sat out long enough not to be even luke-warm. Fries were stone cold.  Something I love: $9 for an order of cold fries.  Service was stretched.  Absolutely nothing special about the burgers or BurGR.  Easier to walk a block down the street to get a hot Quarter-Pounder at McDonald's.  You won't get quite the amount of beef but it will be hot and less than an third the price.  You won't be paying for the fancy curved flame wall at the entrance.  While BurGR is less expensive than other casino eateries, it is still in the category of taking your money for little in return.  Try a Big Mac - you and your pocketbook will be happier.  Don't use the excuse \"it's Vegas, Baby.\"   Ramsay is there to take your money.  I think I'm older and more experienced at decent dining than many of the reviewers for this place.  Note the reviews that say they are fans of Ramsay - doesn't have a thing to do with the food actually served - and I assure you - Ramsay didn't cook these things."}
{"text":"This was worth the trip.   Great service,  great food.   Try the farm burger.   The duck bacon was amazing."}
{"text":"The wait after the order was placed was long. The food was cold and not that good and the waitress was not attentive-almost Nonexistent. I would not go back."}
{"text":"This Restaurant DOES NOT live up to the hype!!! My husband and I came in after the J-Lo concert. Surprisingly there was NO wait to be seated, got seated right away at this table that STUNK like dirty hamper, we didn't know if it was the plastic table place mat (was that all about???? It doesn't even look nice), the napkin or the chair. We asked to be seated elsewhere and we quickly were. We ordered the American Burger, Just Fries and Onion rings, I expected more from a $15. Burger, it was OK but it wasn't great, maybe Thousand Island on it would of probably helped or NOT, fries were good however the batter on the Onion Rings was not fully cooked therefore we asked for Onion Rings to be taken off our bill, which waiter reluctantly did, waiter felt the \"need\" to inspect them so he broke one open. Very disappointed, we thought it be better, we will not return."}
{"text":"over rated!!! go to port a call, new orleans louisiana if you want a real burger with a must have monsoon"}
{"text":"I shared a Farm Burger, Parmesan Truffle fries and the sticky toffee pudding push pops with my husband for our Valentine's Day lunch. The Farm Burger has duck breast bacon, cheddar cheese and a fried egg on a brioche bun. We ordered it medium but it was more like a medium rare burger but it was delicious regardless and we loved it. The Parmesan Truffle Fries were very good and came with an aioli sauce that was very tasty.  We ordered the sticky toffee pudding push pops because we thought it would be more like the sticky toffee pudding at Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse at Paris next to Planet Hollywood but it wasn't.  The sticky toffee pudding at Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse is one of the best desserts I've ever had.  This dessert at Burgr was just ok for me. It was like a brownie ice cream push pop and was a little too sweet for me. Kids might like it!  Service was good and our overall dining experience was excellent. If you sign up for a free Total Rewards players card at Planet Hollywood you can get $1 off each dish and if you have enough points you can use it to pay for your meal. The Farm Burger was $14, Parmesan Truffle Fries $10 and Sticky Toffee Push Pops $6 (prices with a Total Rewards card).  I would recommend this place and will be dining here again."}
{"text":"Food was good no doubt.  Service needs some major adjustments...the wait in line to be seated took about 45 minutes, after beinging seated it took about 15 minutes for waitress to take our order. The food took about another 30 minutes. Even though the food was good the wait time leaves a regretful taste not soon forgotten"}
{"text":"I had planned to eat dinner here but wound up somewhere else that evening, so I came back later that night for a snack. Fortunately, the burgers are small, so they work for that purpose. I had a beer (I forget the name, but it was a domestic hefeweizen) and the blue cheese burger and enjoyed them both.  A couple of notes of interest: The hostesses wear tight little dresses and sneakers--it looks a little weird, but I respect their allowing them proper shoes to work in. All the drinks and desserts are on an iPad. I don't know why the whole menu isn't because you're looking at drinks on an iPad and food on a regular paper menu."}
{"text":"This place was one of the best places I have eaten a burger in a long time. Needless to say thats a given considering who owns it. I had the coffee milkshake #5 and I could drink one of those every day! My american burger was good and the jalapeno poppers were amazing. If your ever on the strip, stop in there. Some guy tried to bribe the girls at the front desk to let him in before others who had waited way longer. He tried 10,20 and 50 bucks before he finally got the hint that no meant no!!"}
{"text":"Went to BurGR last night (12-22-13) after eying this restaurant since moving down to Vegas. Both my husband and I love Gordon Ramsey and wanted try a more affordable restaurant  to experience what he has to offer. It was a Sunday night around 6:30-7 and it was hopping! Since it was just the two of us we only had to wait 25 minutes which isn't too bad with the line that was out front.     We both already knew what we wanted to order so when our server it was quite painless. Although we didn't see him again until he brought the check and had some random table bus boy who was clearing off the table next to us ask if we wanted refills and then brought us the refills. Hello waiter?...     I had the Euro Burger and the Maui Onion rings and my husband had the Bleu Burger and the Parm/Truffle fries. I have to say both the burger and the onion rings had way to much salt. I don't think I have ever had a salty burger before! At first I thought maybe it was the goat cheese or something but my husband agreed that his burger and fries were also too salty. Real bummer...I could have made a better burger and fries. And when I go out to eat I don't want to be comparing food to what I could have just made at home.     Also I like the decor of the restaurant. It felt like a 50's diner. Down side to the restaurant beside the overly salted food was the noise! Oh my goodness...so loud! Don't try to carry on a conversation with anyone. Turn down the music...sheesh!    Probably won't be returning to BurGR and I am depressed to say that. Nothing really stood out and \"wowed\" me. Also the uniforms are very unforgiving (for either sex) and I could have done without seeing that."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for two and had a great experience.  My date and I waited for 30 minutes before being seated (not too shabby), and were served almost instantly.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my dated ordered the Farm Fresh Burger.  We also ordered Truffle fries.  Overview Hell's Kitchen Burger- amazingly delicious, the right amount of spiciness, and comes with an egg.  Farm Fresh Burger- only had one bite, but seemed a little heavy.  Didn't have any vegetables  Truffle fries- delicious, but I think overhyped.  They were $11 and seemed like typical french fries only with truffle seasoning on top.  I guess it would be good if you like truffle fries  Service and experience were amazing.  We ended up watching a UCLA football game on the screen and finishing in under an hour.  Quick, friendly, somewhat affordable. 4/5"}
{"text":"Ummm, just Okay . I've had better!! Went with a group of Five and everyone ordered something different off the menu from Burgers, Chicken wings, Jalapeño Poppers, and Fries."}
{"text":"It was kinda crowded, so there was a wait to get in, but we left our number so we could walk around while we waited for a table. They texted us when the table was ready, which I thought was pretty cool.   I had the Euro Burger which was soooooo good! I love the different flavors that I'm not used to having in a burger. The truffle fries were amazing too! I thought it was a lot of food that you get...didn't even come close to finishing it.  Wish I had room for more though because I wanted to try the desserts that everyone raves about. Will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas and will be sure to have dessert!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, especially the burgers. I haven't tried the faro salad but saw a table next to me order it and it looked amazing.   I give this place 2 stars because the hostesses and most of the staff in general are a bunch of assholes. We came here 2 nights in a row and thought we would have better luck the second time but that wasn't the case. We sat at the bar near the entrance and ordered an american burger and asked to swap the lettuce for arugula and the bartender was complete asshole about that. As if it were taking soo much of his precious time to actually use the computer and input the switch. Like it's not that hard to do. Everyone here just has a really terrible fucking attitude and it's really annoying! The servers are pretty decent though, so I'm mostly referencing to the bartenders (at least the blonde guy wearing glasses) and the hostesses. The hostesses are fucking shit. I want to punch them in the face. They are so stupid and act like their job is so difficult. They have shitty attitudes and try to talk down to everyone like they're so much better or something. GTFO.  So yea the customer service here is fucking terrible. If you don't care about that and just want to eat a burger then go for it. But if you're looking for an experience and good customer service  then this isn't the place.  Also yesterday we spoke with the manager Nicky about her hostesses attitude problems and she said she understood and has had several complaints and is working on training them better but after coming back second time I think that there is more to the problem than management can handle. I also think that not all the managers are on the same page so there's a lot of mess going on. I was expecting so much more from being a restaurant of Ramsey. I know he himself can be an asshole but I think that's how it goes as a chef and was not expecting g the same shitty attitude from the staff. I hope they figure it out or change their staff!"}
{"text":"So let me keep it short. DON'T GO HERE. I was really excited to come here cause I've been here and loved it about a year ago. Quality has gone way down. I waited about 40 minutes for my burger and they gave me a so/so burger with STALE fries. Completely disappointed. Oh and the jalapeno poppers were overly fried and not good at all."}
{"text":"Great burgrs, nice cocktails and friendly staff. Burgers cost from 12 to 15 USD, cocktail pretty much of the same price."}
{"text":"I don't eat a lot of meat so I was skeptical.   I ordered the Uber burger and was so surprised.  I absolutely LOVE it.  We need one of these in Louisville, Ky."}
{"text":"Got here around 3:30 or so on New Years Day. For couples, they said the wait was about 30-35 minutes, and it was. The restaurant looks so cool...fans of Hell's Kitchen might appreciate that it kind of resembles the HK show kitchen. Anyway, I'm not a huge burger fan, so I got the Southern Yardbird (chicken burger + sharp cheddar + mustard bbq sauce+ pickle + butter lettuce)   and my fiance got the Damnation Chicken Burger (fiery hot mayo + maytag blue cheese + celery & carrot slaw. Plus we ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries and the Sweet Potato fries. OMG. everything was so good. Now, I'll say that the Damnation chicken burger was better than the southern Yardbird...that spicy mayo and the slaw give it the extra kick that it needs to take it over the top! the parm truffle fries were delish and came with 2 sauces that were fantastic. and the Sweet potato fries came with some kind of powdered sugar on them that made them amazing too! I wish I had ordered a milkshake too, but now I have a reason to go back! Loved it and it was worth every penny!"}
{"text":"LOVED the chanterelle burger.  Everything else on the menu looked awesome but really couldn't decide.  The cocktails were amazing.  Keep it up BURGR!  Slow service though.  I'd definitely come back next time."}
{"text":"Ate here twice now. They have a stupid seating system. You can't request or put your name down until everyone in your party has arrived. This makes no sense! If we're a party of 12 for instance then your entire party has to be here before they can put your name down! How does that work? The entire party gets here and then they still can't do anything except wait around. Why can't we just put our names down and then wander around your Casino or do other things and come back at the designated time? The girls up in the front working up as hostess are just doing what they're told to do but it's a stupid rule that makes them look foolish!  The next time we were here we were only a party of four and one of us had a bad back. We requested a soft back chair like a booth but they said that the entire party had to be here first. And even then there was no guarantee that we would get a booth despite the fact that we would request it and wait for it! How does this help any? Again it's a stupid system with stupid rules are they have to follow!  As for the food, it was pretty good, more flare than anything else! They use the Mangalitsa pork for the pork burger and it was decent. I ordered this both times!"}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars.  Innis & Gunn with a farm burger.  Very good combination.  Bacon over powered the underseasoned burger.  Not a terrible thing if you like bacon.  The cook was perfect.  Meat to bun ratio was spot on.    Service: great service kept this experience from being a let down.  Ashley was our server, she was friendly and professional.  Her attention to detail and our satisfaction was obvious and appreciated."}
{"text":"I do NOT know what the hype is. Their burger tastes like purée that's mashed together into a patty shape. Tasteless, horrible texture, cold and undercooked. The fries were bland, the sauces should be replaced with ketchup and the raspberry ice tea was the worst I've ever had. I only give them two stars, because the manager and waitstaff were incredible. He even comped our \"next\" meal because they saw we didn't eat our food. It was so bad that we're not going back for our free meal. McDonalds handily beats this place and is much cheaper."}
{"text":"I can't not give 5 stars.  Made a trip to Vegas for my 3rd time. I had to try BurGR! My husband and I went around 3pm and it was not busy at all! Decent change between lunch and dinner. As a table we ordered the onion rings and truffle parm fries. We ate all of the onion rings but were saving room for our burger. The few of the fries I did eat were delicious! I ordered the Euro burger and my husband got the farm burger. He loved it! As for mine, I'd definitely order it again. Makes every other burger hard to compare.  The next time I'm in town I think this will be a must."}
{"text":"Before entering the restaurant I was somewhat apprehensive at the thought of being overcharged for what is essentially a burger with a celebrity brand. By the end of the dinner I was totally satisfied with the delectably grilled beef patty and spoiled by the splendid service.   I had the Farm Burger which contains a beef patty (I asked for it medium rare), an egg (sunny side up), and slices of duck bacon. For sides I had truffle fries (for sharing) and for drinks I had an Oreo shake. I would recommend everything which I had though the caramel in the shake made it a bit sweet. I would also strongly recommend the Farm Burger.   Special mention to the staff who made us feel very welcomed and for splitting one of our burgers (without being asked) when they knew it was being shared.  The burgers aren't cheap but being located on the strip, I would say that the prices at the restaurant are reasonable."}
{"text":"The truffle fries and burger were amazing and the wait wasn't long but... the cleanliness of the restaurant left more to be desired."}
{"text":"We tried BurGR after eating at GR steak the night before.  Let me get the only complaint I have out of the way.   The staff at the hostess counter was not friendly at all, the main hostess a short Hispanic girl seemed annoyed at everyone.  No smile, or hi completely ignored everyone. Which is what kept me from giving the 5 stars.   About 5 minutes of silence the seating hostess finally acknowledges, greets us and takes us to our table.  It was all smooth sailing from here on out.  Our waitress was very nice and kept our glasses full.  Which was great because we started with the jalapeño poppers and with my luck the 1st one I found was the \"special\" one.    My husband ordered the HK burger medium and I had the brittania burger medium well.  Both were delicious but a word of advice if you don't like too spicy then order the HK without jalapeños or else be careful, these were hot!  My brittania was delish!  I just wish I would have ordered mine medium.    For dessert we had the sticky toffee pops which were so good, I prefer them warm like at steak but they were goooood none the less."}
{"text":"Go for the burgers!  We had Farm which was the best burger by far. Tender good quality meat with well roasted bread.  Hell's Kitchen burger with jalapenos overwhelm burger's natural flavors- good for those into jalapenos.  Forget about the Truffle Parmesan fries. Its hand cut fries are not worth the pricey $11.  Our original fries serving was old and manager was nice enough to change for freshly cooked ones. But its Truffle fries are still not as good as Stripburger's ($9 too!)"}
{"text":"best burger i have had in awhile i had the hells kitchen, i somehow had low expectations for this place but i was not disappointed"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and both times it was amazing. It is now going to be a tradition to go back on every trip we make to Vegas. There is always a wait but you can put your name in and they will send you a text when your table is almost ready so that you don't have to just stand in line. The first time I tried the burger the pepper on it and it was HOT I ended up having to pick it off halfway through but the flavor was incredible. The sweet potato fries are a must try, they are served with a dip that really makes the fries better than anyone else's. The burgers are the perfect size not too thick but not super thin, they also come on a unique bun that suites the burger well. We tried the parmesan fries the second time and they are good also, they come with a garlic dip that is super potent but goes well with the parmesan on top of the fries. As far as service I would have expected something better from a place of Gordon's, that is the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars. We had to wait forever for refills and our waitress hardly checked back on us... at least the food didn't have any problems that needed addressing."}
{"text":"Dropped $75 for two burgers, fries, and a couple of beers, including a tip. Take it as a given that you will be ripped off just about everywhere on the strip; this was no exception.... My husband and I split two burgers - the chanterelle burger with mushrooms and figgy onion jam, and the Ramsey burger - an off the menu \"specialty\" with duck breast bacon, cheddar, and avocado. We ordered them medium-rare. One was perfect, the other came out medium-well. I can just imagine GR shaking his head and saying \"such a shame\" as he dumps the burger into the trash. Of course I sent it back, and to their credit, they were extremely apologetic and got the replacement out in record time. Both burgers were quite delicious, not at all greasy but still very juicy. I normally order my steak medium-rare and my burgers medium but here I trusted that the meat would be good enough to order medium rare, and that was the right call. the Ramsey burger was the better of the two but I have one complaint. It is identical to the farm burger on the menu with the exception that avocado is substituted for an egg. For this, you pay $5 more and of course the waiter doesn't mention this. Seriously? This is such a blatant rip off that I am inclined to shake my head at Gordon and give him one of my own \"such a shame\" mutterings, but yes, it was indeed a very good burger. The Parmesan truffle fries were delicious, but for $11 I expect them to be the best damn fries I ever tasted. Were they? No. Were they good? Yes, even very good, but not spectacular... I wasn't thrilled with the list of beers on tap, given my preference for medium brown ales without a lot of hops. I ordered a Sierra Nevada, which was fine, but the only one of 15 or so that fit the bill. At the same time they had 5 or 6 good IPAs to choose from. Great if you love IPAs but how about three of each style? All in all a good experience but if you're looking for the best burger you've ever had, you probably won't find it here."}
{"text":"Food: Burger and fries (serv. size is for two people) Taste: Out of this world delicious, highly recommend Beverage: Diet Cherry Pepsi Price: Burger - ~$15 and fries ~$7 Service: Outstanding  Staff: Clean and attentive Cleanliness: Restaurant, silverware, glasses, etc. all spotless Wait time: For 7 people at 7:30pm on Memorial Day weekend it took 15 minutes"}
{"text":"ummm, I hoped for better having eaten burgers all over and read the Yelp reviews.  As a solo diner I had a very short wait 5 minutes compared to couples 40, and quads 90 minutes.  The service: generally very friendly and helpful, veeerryyy short skirts and I'm no prude.  Food: After all the most important part was where it all fell apart, the menu sounds great, bus as all Ramsey meals I've had so far fell far short. My special cheeseburger with Goat's Cheese etc was anything but. They clearly cooked it to order as it as rare as requested, but just didn't taste of anything much, and with that much cheese is a crime. Truffle fries, were in a large portion and well fried but had little taste and we're by no means the best I've tasted. The idea of covering truffle fries in Parmesan cheese also seems wrong, were there to be any Truffle taste originally it's unlikely to survive parmesan...  The prices were steep and though I didn't pay for it (had a credit in the hotel) I felt like for the quality I would have been unhappy were I to have...."}
{"text":"Wow. Spicey chicken burger was tender & delicious with just the right amount of spice. Truffle fries were so yummy I had to stop myself (and there was plenty to share).  The cocktails are interesting & good (if pretentiously shown on iPads) and the milkshakes are yummy. However, I'm not sure the 2\" or so of pudding that comes o. Top of your actual shake adds, it was too sweet for me & the shake do good, I wish I'd had more of that!   The service here is good & although a little expensive for burgers, it is Vegas, and it clearly is an elevated burger: each bite is quality."}
{"text":"This place is a joke... If this joint wasn't named after a celebrity no one would go there.. Totally overrated.. Perfect example of how stupid and soft people are in this world and how they fall for the Grand Illusion.. At the end of the day it is a freakin Burger and that's all LOL"}
{"text":"Not all that impressed I should say, nothing to complain about. 3.5 stars in my views I suppose it's just a price to value ratio I didn't like. Service and food were fair, actually the drinks were great. Just takes a little more to earn 4 or 5 stars for me."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. My boyfriend and I are big fans of Gordon Ramsay and couldn't wait to go to Burgr when we were on vacation in Vegas. Big disappointment. 30 minute wait just to be seated at the bar and an even longer wait to receive our food. We both ordered the Farm Burger....... I must say that the burger was small and the beef lacked flavor. The only upside was the delicious cheddar cheese and duck breast bacon. We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries which were cold and not very crispy. Definitely not worth the price. Bobby Flay has a much better burger. To be quite honest, I'd rather go to Fat Burger. Many other options on the strip for a delicious burger at a reasonable price. #VERY DISAPPOINTED......"}
{"text":"I went there with my lovely wife so excited to go to first Gordan ramsy restaurant. The food taste very good. We ordered fries with truffle parmesan cheese fries and fried jalapeno as apptizred which we shared. They tasted phenomenal without a question !! Also I ordered Hell Kitchen Burger and my wife asked for Farm Burger.  Every thing was normal except that I felt at the restaurant unbelievably full and I know I didn't eat that much. The surprise was when we arrived home. My wife couldn't sleep that night and she felt sick and she ended up in the bathroom throwing up basically every she ate.For me , The next two days of that night were a nightmare. I couldn't eat any thing except drinking water.  I think that is a SHAME. Very hard to swallow the fact that, Big chef like him make you pay premium money for burger and fries which will makes horribly ill !!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!!  Good burgers for a good price & even quick service from our waitress.  We ordered the farm burger & the Hell's Kitchen burger.  Farm burger was definitely better!  Both were big enough to snack on later in the day."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their earth burger dressed like a euro burger with a side of truffle fries. The staff was amazing and didn't know the word 'no'! They catered. Food was delicious, decor and atmosphere was lovely and fun!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place has good reviews. My veggie burger (mushroom) was fine, but the truffle fries were soggy and my husband's Euro burger was atrocious! Some OK-to-mediocre toppings but a terrible patty. It's pretty amazing when you go to a burger place and the burger meat itself is worse than anything you'd get at McDonald's, Wendy's, or Burger King!   The service was terrible; slow and indifferent. Our waitress had a huge smile plastered on her face, even when we told her that my husband's burger was sub-par. I honestly don't think she was listening.  The entire time, I kept imagining Gordon Ramsay yelling at the chefs and wait staff. He should pay his restaurant an incognito visit."}
{"text":"Damn!! (Gordon Ramsay's voice) this place was well worth the wait. It is a first come first serve wild burger place. I highly recommend the Hell's Kitchen burger. It's full of spices and flavor. It's a la carte so be sure to order fries. Suggestion: TRUFFLE FRIES!! Best I have ever had. Thank you Chef Gordon. Job well done"}
{"text":"Very long wait for us (we were told 20-25 mins, it was more like 45-50 mins). Excellent service, ambience and food. The staff member was courteous, well-informed about the menu and gave us great suggestions. An experience to remember (despite the wait)!  We got the fish and chips sandwich (large portion, very tasty) and the Euro burger which was also very good!"}
{"text":"Awful. I'm guessing most people give it a good review because they are trying to talk themselves into the idea that they had a good meal at a celebrity chefs restaurant in Vegas. Who doesn't want to tell their friends and also say it's great!  It's not. It's actually pathetic. Avoid."}
{"text":"Great service and good food, engaging management. Long line moves quickly.   Expensive for a hamburger but not in relation to Las Vegas prices."}
{"text":"Waiting 30 min to be seated on a Saturday was a pleasant surprise;but we learned very fast that we will pay for this later. After you sink into a chair, and the table comes up to your chin, drinks come promptly, and the waitress takes your order. 50 minutes later your food arrives. I mean, it's just burgers, shouldn't take 50 minutes after you place your order. The meat was good, bun soft, condiments almost non existent. (one sad little roasted tomato and a little bit of cheese, the sauce was not even noticeable) The fries were ok, if you like not very crunchy, soft, large fries. The sweet potato fries come with a vanilla custard, sou you can skip on a dessert, those were actually surprisingly good. Seriously, had better; but if you are a fan of waiting, and a huge slab of meat with little or no sides....enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place earned all 3 of their stars based on quality of food and taste. It lost 2 because of the aftermath.  We heard about this place before we traveled to Vegas. A friend just raved about how amazing it was and how we must go. Checked out Google timeline and found an okay time with less of a crowd. Pretty short wait, even though they were busy.   When we were say, we noticed the table and chair heights are kind of wonky,  but we liked it. The menu presentation was unique and the waitress was knowledgeable about the menu. As i don't live in Vegas, I decided to try the most popular item which was a burger with jalapeno on it. Amazing. I devoured that burger.   The milkshakes are amazing too. Save room for it. It's well worth it.  How this place lost two stars: I was kicked out of Penn  & Teller for puking outside the theater. I was up all night sick, had to fly home severely dehydrated, and was this close to asking for someone to take my uninsured bum to the ER. 9 days later, I finally was able to eat normal food again. But, if I didn't wonder if I was facing Montezuma's revenge in Nevada, I would rate this 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is quite large and seats many.  First thing we noticed is the waitress' outfits are very skimpy but not all the waitresses should be wearing them.  Then you notice the large picture of Gordon Ramsay on the wall with his hands up - its not even a mediocre photo (WTF is it supposed to say) - fire your photographer Gordon.  Lastly the menus are quite cleverly designed and positioned on the tables folded over the napkin rolls.    I opened the menu and the prices were shocking (for a burger joint) and didn't include ANY sides.  Okay we're in vegas (justifies some of it) so I'll give it a shot.  The burger that came out was cooked properly (medium) but rather small and the meat was bland.  The toppings were good and the bun was meh.  Overall it wasn't a bad burger but it wasn't great either (and definitely not worth the money).  We ordered the parm fries and they were quite tasty but $8 for potatoes? Ouch.  I'm fairly certain they were not freshly cut like any decent fast dining burger joint (five guys, in-and-out burger, etc).  This is a marketing project masquerading as a restaurant with a celebrities name in the title.  The food is good enough to keep the customers coming in but it's absolutely a tourist trap and wouldn't survive in any normal town especially with the proliferation of other great fast casual burger establishments.  I would suggest Gordon take a tour around the US and visit the top burger restaurants before opening another one of these restaurants.  Ted's Buffalo Grill wipes this place off the map in every way.  Vortex has far better burgers and five guys has a much better value.  I don't think i'll be back next time I'm in vegas - too many other places to try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend came in for a burger, I wanted something different so I went with two sides: the sweet potato fries and the hummus. Yes, a weird combo but both were so delicious! The hummus was one of the best I ever had which is remarkable since their specialty are burgers. The sweet potato fries were great too. There was a bit of a line, but the wait was well worth it."}
{"text":"Ate at BurGR on my birthday March 6 2016... worst service I have ever had in my life... the server was completely off and gave such attitude, most of the staff seemed to be either brain dead or stupid...food took over an hour to get to our table and by this point it needed to be boxed up as my 17 month old son was ready to go. I am still bitter as I am a loyal fan of GR. As far as the restaurant goes I thought the female staff were dressed quite tacky even for Vegas.. if I wanted boobs/ass/gine in my face I would have gone to a gentlemen's club. When hot food was brought to the table it tasted good, but terrible service and good food can't balance each other out."}
{"text":"it is my second time here and I am still not disappointed!  The Maui onion rings here are the best I have ever eaten and they are large portions good enough for two people. the truffle fries and a sweet potato fries are just as good and eat one is good enough for two people.  first time I was here I have the farm burger with the duck bacon which is really good and it comes with a fried egg too. second time around I tried the euro burger and the goat cheese was really good.  the shakes are really thick, it has three scoops of ice cream. first time I had the caramel chocolate second time I had the creme brulee Oreo. I bet it's like a thousand calories each shake but its good.  the boa appetizer and chicken wings are good but its small portions. the service we got here was great everyone is very efficient and they move fast so you're not waiting too long for your food or your drinks. I didn't even have to ask the best person or waitress once for a drink they always refilled me."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait!! With this being a celebrity restaurant, the wait was a little long but totally worth it. Top notch customer service. The turkey burger is delicious! Very attentive staff. And the fries will be some of the best you've ever had!"}
{"text":"I'm not kidding with my 5 starts! This restaurant is seriously the best! The burgers a gigantic and the milkshakes....so innovative with the addition of pudding! I love it! honestly...it was the best milkshake that I had while in Vegas this trip.  (And I had a few!) The staff are so unique and really add to the experience of the restaurant.  If there is one thing for me to nit pick against with this location it would be the height of the chairs...they are a little short...I'm 5'9\" and found the chairs quite short for my legs but my mom who is only 5'3\" even found the chairs to be low making it seem for her like the table was too high! This is the only thing that could be tweaked about the restaurant! (ask for a booth when you are getting your name on the wait list for a table ;) :P )  I can't wait to come back for more BurGR!!!!!  Thanks for the stellar meal! - Kerri -"}
{"text":"If i come to vegas and dont eat here my trip was a failure. Been to vegas six times and each time I've had a bite here. They're right inside planet Hollywood. Burgers are truly great here. The sugar coated fries are amazing as well. Nice decor with the fire strip in the background. Not a terrible wait but I've never been here at peak hours."}
{"text":"Waiting for over one hour for one burger so far.  No one came by at all once we placed our order. Haven't tried food yet. So far customer service horrible."}
{"text":"Took my parents here for lunch last time they were in town and had a blast. Ashley was our server and did an amazing job. She walked us through the menu and gave us suggestions on how to enjoy our experience to the fullest! We started out with the jalapeño poppers... I got the hot one, I had a farm burger, my wife a euro burger, my mom a chicken burger, and my dad an all American. We shared the sweet potato fries which were tasty!! Awesome place with awesome service and food!!"}
{"text":"Food is great as expected but the service needs some serious help. My wife and sister were treated poorly when they tried dine in with my 5 month old son. Although there were open tables they were asked to \"wait\"  20minutes - the hostess made my wife uncomfortable and they left. Not family friendly..."}
{"text":"We didn't have to wait long for our table and ordered a beef burger, duck burger and sweet potato fries. The fries were coated in some sweet or honey dressing so I couldn't eat them. The burgers were ok but you wouldn't know the duck was not beef, this place seems to be getting poor ratings lately. Food is average at best, go to a fast food place for the same quality. Shame, we thought with his name over the door it would be better"}
{"text":"This is some what of a diamond in the rough for Vegas. Priced close to normal, an extreme rarity on the strip. Both burgers my wife and I had were very good. The onion rings were great though. Good job Gordon."}
{"text":"Amazing! That cheese uber burger was soooo good! Was never really a fan of a coffee milkshake, but Milkshake #5 has clearly changed all that!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. One of my favorite burger places. I've eaten here several times. Besides the burgers; the gourmet dogs, the onion rings, and the jalapeno poppers are awesome. Huge selection of beers on tap. Service and ambiance are mostly top notch. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars (I'd give it 4 1/2 if I could) is sometimes the bartenders are not that attentive. Other times they are great!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation.We talked to the host and told her we have reservation for 6. she said we don't do reservations. We stayed in line for more than an hour. When we got to the host she said oh, party of 6 you could have just signed in on the waiting list. Well. It would have been nice if she had told us an hour ago. The restaurant is by the mall/casino entrance and freezing cold ( you can see entrance in the pic ). They have tables by the door with no heating system, no blocking walls,nothing. The host said if you want you can sit at this table( by the door) or wait additional 45 hours. The host was rude and was raising her voice. We talked to the manager ( Jake Eaton ) and he said you have to wait for an hour 40 mins in the waiting list. The next thing. There are 10-12 seats by the kitchen bar. We even offered to sit there but the manager Jake Eaton said we don't have server. I said there are always exceptions, why can't you make an exception and have someone serve us. He said I can't do that. Then 15 minutes later there were people sitting there. All I can say I expected a lot more from Gordon Ramsey. I was so excited to eat here but for sure it was ruined. I cannot recommend this place !! overpriced !! Rude staff !! Incompetent management !! The manager was good for nothing. He should get fired !! He knows nothing about customer service. He didn't even offer a discount. NEVER EVER !!"}
{"text":"Lived in Vegas all my life. Hate the strip and avoid it at all costs especially since I work there, but I'm obsessed with Gordon Ramsay thanks to Kitchen Nightmares as well as my boyfriend so we had to try it.   Dined last night, walked in a little before 11. Got seated right away which was a nice surprise considering I was expecting some kind of wait. Loud atmosphere, but what else could you expect at a popular restaurant at a casino? Menu is simple and detailed well enough for customers to understand. We ordered onion rings as an appetizer which took longer than usual to come out, which was fine considering they were cooked to perfection. Boyfriend thought they were a little bland in taste over all, but I found them to be quite appetizing especially when dipped with their specialty ranch sauce, yum! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. Perfect spicy for me and my boyfriend got the American. Both our burgers were good, nothing to rave over, but we enjoyed them over all. Truffle Parmesan fries were very good! We figured we probably won't be going all the time so we might as well try their popular items. All in all they were good, quality was fresh and you can taste that in the food. Bill was $55 for everything we ordered and a drink. Good quality, good food, decent service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were really excited to try the burgers here.  There is a wait so you'll want to come early to beat the rush.  I ordered the farm burger cooked medium, it came out well done and was pretty dry.  Everything else on it was ok, not great like I was hoping for.  My girlfriends burger came out dry as well.  The onion rings were really good.  What blew us away the the milkshake.  We ordered the creme brulee cookies and cream shake.  Probably the best milkshake we ever had.  We're returning to vegas in 2 weeks and will probably stop by just for the milkshakes."}
{"text":"One of the best burger places that I have ever been, too! I ordered the Euro Burger medium rare and let me tell you it was cooked to perfection! The patty as so juicy and flavorful. Just thinking about the burger is making my mouth water. If you're ever in Vegas, you'll have to stop here and try it!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and staff are 5 stars unfortunately the charred flavor of the medium cooked burger was big letdown for such a high priced burger"}
{"text":"The burger was great and surprisingly not too expensive. I'm not sure why they don't include sides by default though, you have to order fries separately and I thought that kinda sucked."}
{"text":"Get it together servers... We were seated immediately waited 7 minutes then got handed off to 3 separate servers. Excellent beer selection. We had the hells kitchen and the uber cheese. Shared the truffle fries. I thought food was excellent.  So some good, some bad."}
{"text":"Make sure you check in at the desk and don't stand in line. The Euro Burger was really good flavored are nice and well seasoned worth the $16 with the truffle fries."}
{"text":"I got the Farm House burger which wasn't bad and tried my friends Hells Kitchen burger which was way better. I feel like the burgers are a little overrated since I've been to multiple places who's burgers top BurGR. (Umami, Fathers Office, Haus Dog, Sladers 50/50, The Counter...)  I do recommend you get a milkshake. I had the Oreo creme brûlée one which was amazing. Definitely one of the top shakes I've tried in my years."}
{"text":"Place was amazing. We were told the wait was going to be 45 minutes for 2 people (on a Saturday at 7pm) and we went in 20.  Placed was packed! We sat at the counter so it was like sitting on \"the Chefs\" table. hehehe The Farm Burger was amazing and if you are goign to have an appetizer... you must try the chicken wings. The Honey-Wasabi was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Just another fad walk in restaurant on the strip.  After the meal I felt somewhat disappointed.  I didn't even finish the entire burger I had.  Given the prices I probably won't go back.   It is just catering to the stupid tourists that come to Vegas.  I would rather have an In & Out burger and chocolate shake.  Both are less than half the cost of any of the burgers on the menu at this place.  They also taste better too.  Just not impressed."}
{"text":"I am fortunate enough to experience fine dining on many different levels.  One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas is at Gordon's place.  It is obvious that Gordon takes pride in making sure his staff understands the service industry and looks for experience because each person was very courtesy and knowledgeable not only of the menu which showed that they had committed it to memory.     Our server described each dish with his own personal experience and interpretation of what the chef was attempting to do on the burger. I have tried all the burgers and I can't choose a favorite one so you can't go wrong. My only suggestion is order what ever the special is!  During the meal the manager came to the table and we explained that our dining experience to that point had been excellent because of the attention to detail and prompt service of the wait staff especially our server.    All in all our experience will be enhanced knowing that each time we travel to Vegas there is a place to get an amazing burger and have tje quality of service and five star dining.    I will suggest one important fact not to miss! Leave room in that tummy for the sweet potato fries and remember to powder the fries with the sugar they provide. In fact order two cups of fries because they are amazing!  Well done GORDON ............Vegas should be proud to have you apart of it!"}
{"text":"Average and decent burger at best. You can easily find any other place that serves burgers of this quality. Patty was dry and bland. Toppings for the burgers were boring and uninspiring. I was expecting more from a Gordon Ramsay joint but this was really quite disappointing. Service was mediocre. Asked for a new set of cutlery and the waiter forgot. Asked for bacon with my burger and either the waiter forgot to write it down or he kitchen overlooked. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Outstanding burger and appetizers. Burger was cooked perfectly, the bun was light and fluffy, and delicious. Jalapeño poppers were incredible, and last but not least, the truffle fries were something special. Service was great too."}
{"text":"First time trying this place! Really delicious. Went to it on Saturday night with no reservations and waited about 20 minutes for 2 people which isn't so bad.  Had a good waiter, all the staff were very cool.  My sister ordered the five spice chicken sliders and of course i had to try a burger. Chose the Chanterelle burger with mushrooms arugula  and figgy onion jam. Also got 2 sides... Fried and onion rings.  The sauces and ketchup for the sides weren't the greatest. All of them had some sort of different spice that wasn't appealing. One was spicy. Not something i wanted to dip my fries into. The portions were really big! There were 2 of and we couldn't finish the rings and friends.  Disappointed at the shake menu. Only about 5 to choose from.  Overall it was a good experience for our first time there. I do look forward to going back and trying nee items."}
{"text":"Outstanding is about all I can say. Farm Burger and Blue Burger cooked to perfection. The flavors all complimented each other. Sweet Potato Fries with the vanilla powdered sugar was very good as well. Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings tasted great and the dipping sauces were outstanding. This guy knows what he is doing. Staff and the overall restaurant where great as well."}
{"text":"Good but not fantastic. The jalapeno poppers were very good, as long as you like bacon. Our only real disappointment was our burgers were a little dry. We ordered well-done as always, but they were borderline burnt. Everything was tasty, but not over-the-top excellent. One appetizer, one order of (yummy) truffle parmesan fries, two burgers and a soda came to $60 with tax, before tip. I've had better burgers for less, but I guess we we're paying for the Gordon Ramsay experience! Service was excellent."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best burger I have ever had...and I've had alot of burgers! It was perfectly cooked and full of hearty flavors. The milk shakes are quite delicious as well with a different pudding on top of each. So rich! The fried were well cooked and the sauces were tasty. Service was excellent and quick. Although there was a 45 min wait, it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This review is more about the experience with the executive chef than the food at Booger restaurant.  So we were at Burgr restaurant and had just ordered a $ 15 burger when I noticed that Christine from Hell's Kitchen was standing around talking to two of her friends. I didn't want to interrupt so I waited 10 minutes before one of her friends left. That's when I decided to ask her if she could take a picture with us. I gave my camera to a waitress and politely began to request, \"I am sorry to interrupt...\" Even before I can get the next words out, she RUDELY said twice while raising her finger, \"Oh, but you are interrupting!\" Never have i been so disgusted/appalled at one's behavior toward another polite human, especially after waiting so patiently.    The nerve of this person. She is merely a reality star and she thinks that she is a hot celebrity. I am not sure if even most real celebrities would behave in such a rude manner. It must be because she knows that her food SUCKS and that her gig will be over soon and her 5 seconds of fame will be up.  Mr. Ramsey, you made a big mistake in selecting Christine as your winner and executive chef.   Also, the food was bland and the meat was overcooked, so i would not recommend going to a place where the executive chef is rude and the place is overpriced!"}
{"text":"I have to say - I was very disappointed. Maybe chef Gordon should visit his own restaurant with the Kitchen Nightmares... He would probably trash the burger. I went there with my family on Friday night. The place was busy, we were expecting little bit slower service but haven't expected to be waiting for the beverages at least for 10 min. Each of us ordered different burger. I decided to go with the flagship Hog Burger. It was the most bland piece of meal I had in a very long time. There was not a single ounce of flavor in it. It was like eating some kind of warm tasteless substance, my stomach was getting full, but my taste buds haven't register any kind of sensation. Similar with other burgers. They all tasted like the meat was heated in the microwave, the only difference were bits of various veggies or cheese. The buns were tasteless as well. For an average $17 a burger it feels like a huge rip-off. I love to cook. I use many wonderful recipes from Gordon's cook book on the daily basis, so my disappointment was even bigger. The worst culinary experience of my Vegas trip. S."}
{"text":"OK. First off is why only four stars and not five! Well that is simply the ambiance. There is nothing bad about the setting, but there are just a lot of televisions hanging on the wall. To me this just gives it the feel of a sports bar and not a gourmet burger joint.  But I guarantee you, that is what it is. This is one of the best burgers I have ever had. I do not go in for all the fancy toppings and condiments, so I just got the American Burger. Lettuce, Tomato, onion, cheese and one perfectly cooked 1/2 pound piece of meat. If anyone has ever had burgers and other cuts of beef that were OK; this is the burger that will let you know how a good piece of beef should taste. If you understand the concept of umami, this burger has it.  The fries are different than most people are used to. BurGR does not use russets like most restaurants. So their fries are lighter and less starchy but still have a great crunch. The fries come with two flavored ketchup's. They both add a nice flavor. But the fries are worth it without anything added.  I took the plunge and had myself one the BurGR's milkshakes. The milkshake was wonderful alone and did not need the pudding that it is topped with. But I tell you, the pudding on top makes this one of the most unique milkshakes I have every tasted. It was creamy and chilled to the right temp. I will be going back for more of these shakes when I can.  I did not have any issues with the service. We were well looked after the entire time we were there. When we were first seated, it was near the front. It was a particularity cold day here in Vegas, so we asked to be moved. This was not an issue and we were moved further into the restaurant. We had great service from start to finish. The uniforms are very appealing as well. The uniform has a sexy look to it without being to revealing. Congratulations to the designer for a very appealing and comely look.  One last thing about the restaurant that is very appealing is the kitchen. The kitchen is open at the front so you can see what is going on in there. They also make everything to order. Nothing is precooked. So do expect to wait about 15 to 20 minutes to get your BurGR."}
{"text":"Had the euro burger, so much flavor for something so simple. I'm a sucker for goat cheese. Husband had the Hells Kitchen burger and said it was the best burger he's had. Truffle fries were good, but nothing special. We went again and ordered the sweet potato fries, loved the sweet and spicy together. We also ordered the jalapeño poppers which were very flavorful, nicely presented, and just the right amount of heat. Prices are a little spendy but comparable for the strip and definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Had the popular Hells Kitchen Burger with bacon. Burger was cook perfectly at medium, which is how I like all my burgers. Service was great. Only reason why I couldn't give 5 stars was because of the fries. They were room temperate and stale. Not hot and crispy."}
{"text":"Best place to dine! Service five stars! Food five stars! Atmosphere five stars! Cleanliness five stars! Price five stars!  Long line to get in, but I was VIP and they made me feel like a VIP!  This place was AHHHHHhhhmazing! We started with the jalapeño poppers and I split the Soba noodle chicken salad with my date. The poppers were a little hot for her and I wasn't too found of the sauce. Just the poppers by themselves were awesome. The Soba noodle chicken salad was excellent.  I loved the atmosphere and the cubbies were winning. We decided to finish watching the game and ordered one of the gourmet burgers and dawgs. The food just got better and better.  Along with the awesome drinks we became stuffed, but wanted to try more. The push up pops were small enough to give into temptation and they were very good.  We ate here on our second of five days in Vegas. No other place met the expectations of BurGR. BurGR motivated us to try all of Gordon's places (in Vegas), but they did not equal the experience. I regret not coming here a second or third time before leaving. My next visit here I plan on trying every item on the menu over the stay."}
{"text":"3 Stars for the burger and for our wait person Heather, otherwise 2 stars.   A friend said, \"going to Vegas? You have to go to a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.\" My friend and I chose Burgr at Planet Hollywood. After a \"short\" wait of 30 minutes - waits can be up to two hours-we were shown to our seats. Heather promptly came over and let us know she'd be our server. Very sunny disposition, took our drink order a little later our drinks were delivered by a young man who introduced himself as Don (I think). Heather returned a while later (she was busy) and finally took our meal order.   My friend and I were taking a break from the NBA Summer League basketball games and wished to get back within an hour or so to catch another game, so I asked Don how long he thought it would take our food to be served.  His demeanor changed immediately and  in a condescending tone he said, \"first of all this isn't a fast food place, we cook our burgers to order, if you want them fast this isn't the place\" or something to that affect.  I was taken off guard. I didn't think I'd asked anything unreasonable. I started to back pedal and my friend and I mentioned that we had a game we wanted to get to. His attitude really bugged me. Later, I contemplated going over to the Maitre 'D and complaining, but I just wasn't in the mood.  I wanted to enjoy Gordon Ramsey burger and get back to UNLV.  My friend said I should definitely write to the Ramsey Corp.  So basically , the memory that has stayed with me the longest from my visit is Heather's bright smile and Don's condescending \"this isn't a fast food place.\" And I keep thinking I've watched Gordon Ramsey on TV. If anyone of his chef contestants behaved this way on his Hell's Kitchen show, they'd be screamed and cursed at.  Now the food. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger; spicey mayo, and avocado. It was delicious. My friend enjoyed her regular All-American cheese burger saying it was good, but not great. The fries were disappointing. They were very dry and lukewarm like they'd been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I can imagine Gordon Ramsey making all his chefs taste the fries before throwing them into the trash and berating the chefs to make them all over again or else. Too bad the real thing doesn't match what's on TV.  Do I recommend this place? If you have the time and money (2 burgers, 2 fries, 1 soft drink = $60.00) and want the Gordon Ramsey experience... sure. Would I visit here again? Nope.   No"}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome....perfectly cooked to your preference. Fish and crisps also a must try. Simple, with high quality ingredients and perfectly executed! Often more than 40mn wait. Just ask to sit at the bar. Always some room there and you will enjoy prime view on a well orchestrated kitchen."}
{"text":"After about a four hours drive we were pretty hungry.  Walking in and saw a line and thought \"okay great, how long is this going to take?\"  Checked in with the hostess and she said about a 20 to 25 minutes wait, so I guess not too bad.  So you get in a line for party of two or less.  For larger party you sign in with the hostess.    honey pig bao bun (3/5) -- ordered this for the appetizer.  There's two bao in an order.  The bao (chinese steamed bun) is pretty much like the ones you get when you order the peking duck platter at a Chinese restaurant.  Nice and soft.  Sandwiched in the middle are roasted pork belly, cucumber,  radish, cilantro, and hoisin sauce.  The reason for only 3 stars is because the pork belly was bland.  There's not enough flavor.  And the meat is not fatty enough.  I think if the cha siu was more flavorful and juicy, this would have been mouth watering delicious.      farm burger (3.5/5) -- duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and fried egg.   The beef patty was good.  Moist and juicy.  I ordered a medium and it was cooked just right.  Reason for not giving it a 4 or 5 stars is because I think the duck bacon was a little too salty for my taste.  The saltiness over power the flavor in the beef.    britannia burger (4/5) -- English sharp cheddar, mango chutney, and arugula. Tasty!  The beef patty was juicy and moist.  The mango chutney gives the burger a hint of sweetness.  The arugula provides a pungent peppery taste.  Overall, a well crafted burger.    Oreo shake (5/5) -- YUMMY YUM YUM!  Sooooo good!  Oreo milk shake with a layer of creme brulee and whipped cream.  To add to the deliciousness, you also get a whole oreo on top!  Shared it with my hunnie.  I got the side with the cream :)  The milk shake was creamy.   The creme brulee was so smooth and rich.  Delicious!   Service was good.  Staffs are attentive.  I'll come here again just for the shake.  *All pictures courtesy of hunnie"}
{"text":"After waiting in line for an hour we were given the privilege of paying $18 for a burger that had more salt in it than the ocean.  Sweet potato fries were good.  Service is good. But they only gave us lip service about salt in burger.  Rip off and way over rated. People are like deer in the headlights. Way too enamored by fame of the owner."}
{"text":"There was never NO LINE at this restaurant each time we passed by, so rather than wait, two of us sort of cheated and agreed to divide and conquer by getting seated one at a time at the counter while the other person casually joined in.  Lucky for us, a guest was about to leave next to the empty seat and we were able to sit together.  Matt, the extraordinary server behind the counter, appeared to care for us like we had a direct line to Gordon himself to report anything questionable.  We were served drinks quite efficiently as we took in the steady stream of gorgeous creations being prepared right in front of us.  Everything was truly flawless, including our own choices of  burgers.  I got the protein-style Euro burger and my friend got the When Pigs Fly (I think it was called).  Both were outstanding.  I rarely ever bother with fries but the sweet potato fries we decided to try came with a light dusting of vanilla powdered sugar and a side sauce of something I recall was a whisper of a champagne jalapeño mustard, but don't quote me.  By the time I tasted that I was in such an altered state of bliss I couldn't remember my own name.  Matt was beyond attentive, asking us what we might like or need, refilling my brewed ice tea with a fresh glass each time.  I was almost pleading with him not to dirty another one by the end of the meal but he wouldn't hear of it.  My friend and I did a pay-it-forward with my new seat mate and bought her the chocolate pudding shake with the homemade cookie and dollop of fresh cream on top.  She was SO appreciative, sipping it slowly like she'd never had anything that decadent in her life.  For the three of us at the counter that day, it was a definite 5 Star experience.   Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Yes, one million times yes! We stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and got a table immediately. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about the food but not about the beer (I was unfamiliar with Boddington's and asked if it was a light beer and she asked if I meant \"light in color or...\" and then told me it was dark. Thankfully I asked for a sample and decided on something else). We ordered two Farm Burgers, which don't come with fries, so we got the truffle parmesan fries too. The burgers were cooked perfectly, one medium and one medium rare, and the toppings were fantastic. The Farm Burger has cheddar, a fried egg, and duck bacon and it was the absolute perfect combination! The fries were great too, served with a few dipping sauces (the aioli is the best).  Truthfully the food here was better than the food we got at Gordon Ramsay Steak. I wish Gordon would open a BurGR on the east coast because I really wanted to try the Hell's Kitchen burger too! This is on our list to come back to when we return to Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing burgers!  Even if there is a line it does move pretty fast.   The only thing is that the fries/salad should come with the burger and not be ordered separately.  Had the Hog's Burger: Patty is wrapped in bacon, cheese melted over, topped with pulled pork, fried onions, coleslaw and sauces between 2 perfectly toasted buns"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING!!!!  Hygiene,  hygiene,  hygiene!   I'm writing about the horrific hygiene at this place.   One of the servers was putting on her lipstick and lip liner at the hostess/check in station,  handles plates and silverware.    I'm walking to our table I see another lady sneeze into her hands with both hands cupped.  Didnt wash her hands, just started fixing her her eyeliner with her finger tips.   I told my wife, \"oh my gosh  hope this person isn't serving peple\", and then she walks up to our table and introduces herself stating that she will be our waitress.   I was literally sick to my stomach.   I asked to see the manager, and about 10 minutes of waiting told him the deplorable practices I observed, and left. I wish good old Gordon was there to throw a fit!!!  Stay away if you value your health!"}
{"text":"The Good: The burGR was good. Onion rings were good.  Service was good. The Bad: Table next to ours had the Truffle/Parmesan fries and sent them back as \"so salty they're inedible\". The Ugly: The burGR was not so good that it warranted charging another $9 for sweet potato fries that weren't that good (limp), dusted with powdered sugar, and accompanied with a sweet honey mustard condiment.  Thats: Sweet, under Sweet, dipped in Sweet.  Too much sweet in the middle of lunch if you ask me. Sweet usually works well as a dessert, not so much as a side...  Grade: Fail.  There is no shortage of truly great burgers out there, just not here."}
{"text":"Overpriced,  but tasty burger.  Had the Euro burger and sweet potato fries, none of the burgers come with fries, it's between $9 and $12 to add a side of fries, but if it helps it's large enough for two... Burger was great but still overpriced at $16."}
{"text":"Food is delicious as usual. The Honey-Pig Bao buns are definitely smaller than the last time we ordered them.  The Hell's Kitchen burger and American burger are delicious.   The servers are super friendly and very prompt in brining us refills.   The only thing negative I can say is one of the hostesses in the front looked like she didn't want to be there.  I don't blame her since it was Christmas Day.  We'll be back but probably not order the Bao buns the next time around."}
{"text":"Love the food! Truffle fries were amazing. No doubt everyone was talking about the truffle fries. The smell of truffle was strong and I enjoyed every bite. Definitely recommended this place for anyone who is graving for burgers and fries."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate two birthdays. There was 7 of us, so we showed up early to out our names down. Our wait was a lil longer than expected when my friend went to double check and found out the hostess didn't put our names down. We had to wait an additional 20 min to get a table. Things got better when we finally seated.   The waiter was nice and gave us a breakdown of the menu. It's pretty fancy they provide an iPad, so you can browse the drink and dessert menu. We ordered the bao bun, farm burger, hog burger, Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle flies, and sweet potato fries. I really wanted to try the shake, but I was feeling under the weather that day. All and all, the burgers were savory and flavorful. There were mixed reviews about the fries. Some liked them. Some different.   Maybe next time, we'll try the hot dog and shakes."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! The food was sooooo good and the service was spot on. Our table ordered the wings, the hummus, Hell's Kitchen burger, sweet potato fries and the onion rings.   We only had to wait about a half hour for a table on a busy Saturday night. They texted us when it was ready and we had 10 minutes to show up. This was not a problem since we could just loose a little money on the slot machines while we waited.  I can't wait to back to this place."}
{"text":"I went because of the name, as I don't normally eat out at hamburger joints, but this place was amazing!  Great burgers, fries, and shakes.  Fun staff too!"}
{"text":"This is a hipster place I probably would avoid unless you are a real Gordon Ramsay fan.  That being said I am a Gordon Ramsay fan and I probably wouldn't eat here again even though the food was great.  There was a long line out the door and they don't take reservations.  The food flys out of the kitchen but it still takes a while to be served but consider the restaurant will be @ capacity all day and night.    The food however was great even by burger standards.  The parmesan truffle fries are out of this world the truffle aeoli is unbelievable.  The burgers and buns were great.  You could tell the buns weren't just baked that day but we're probably just out of the oven.    I would give this place a higher rating if there were less hipsters."}
{"text":"The good over all was ok but way over rated if you ask me. Not worth the price. The truffle fries were the best part. Burger was well cooked, nice presentation, but lacking the bold flavor I was expecting. Skip it and find a better burger place for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite burger spot in Vegas. Would be if they had one in my city! Euro Niger, Hell's Kitchen burger and the mushroom one they have is delicious. Had the Parmesan fries the first time I came was nice and crisp. This second time around, felt like it sat under the lamp too long so it wasn't as crispy."}
{"text":"My whole family and I are obsessed with Chef Ramsay haha. They were deciding between Burgr and his steak house. Being vegan I thought coming here would be best for me. I ordered the sweet potato fries and the earth burger but I asked for no cheese and the waiter was kind enough to serve it to me In a lettuce wrap since the brioche buns were not vegan. In the end I ate the earth burgr which was full of flavour and cooked to perfection, and enjoyed myself the sweet potato fries (but I did not use the honey mustard sauce just the ketchup and powdered sugar). Best sweet potato fries I ever had .... I never thought of putting powdered sugar on top and it was soooo good!! Not the worst price I seen , more reasonable!!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Restaurant is a little loud.  The staff was attentive and knowledgable about the food.  I enjoyed the farm burger and onion rings.  Definitely a must next time I'm back in Vegas.  If you're in the mood for a good burger, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have sort of been on a mission to try all of the best burger places in Vegas so I decided to check out Gordon Ramsey's.  I did not care about the long wait or the terrible service or the high price as that is all pretty standard in Vegas....... but I was really disappointed in the food.  Mediocre would be being kind to be honest.  I have found most of the top end burger places to be pretty similar in quality so I was really surprised at how bad it was.  If the positive reviews of this place from others are true it seems at a minimum they are not consistent as no amount of positive thinking could have salvaged my dry little burger with just a sprinkle of Blue Cheese off on one half (just barely enough to justify calling it a Blue Cheese Burger) and an unhappy looking piece of arugula.  It was so dry and bland that I had to specially ask for some catchup (as none is available) just to liven it up.  It was the first time I put catchup on a so called \"gourmet\" burger in my life.  If I had gotten it  a food court somewhere I would have thought nothing of it...... but it does not even approach some the best gourmet burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went to Burgr on our first night and had high expectation because we are a fan of Gordon Ramsay and his restaurants since he values high quality in food and service.  Positives: We both had a bacon cheese burger and it was excellent. It wasn't THE best burger but it was better than most restaurants burgers. Fries were really good, they refilled our glasses before they were even completely empty and we appreciated that. Waiter was really friendly as well. Negatives: The burger made me gassy all night and my husband got an allergy for the rest of the trip but it wasn't itchy it was just there on his ankle. It wasn't because of the restaurant but he only has an allergy to high Niacin which is commonly found in breads but it would require a high amount. But he did have a sauce that hes never had which was the chipotle ketchup. He has never had chipotle sauce so it may have come from that.  I would still go back to try out the rest of the menu and even though it is right next to the casino the vibe was still very nice. We also had a big poster of Gordon Ramsay watching over us as we ate."}
{"text":"Came here with another couple for a late dinner. The burgers were delicious but I don't think the $15 price tag is necessary but, hey, it's Vegas, everything is expensive. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable. The wings were very good, not dry at all and flavorful.  Our appetizer, the truffle fries and wings arrived on time but our main course was taking a long while. She went to go check on it and discovered that the ticket had gotten lost or misplaced. She immediately retook our order (mostly from memory) and we had our food in less than 10min! Cocktails were also very well made and we each enjoyed 2 of them. I recommend the Whiskey Lemonade!"}
{"text":"very bad experience?the waitress is very poker Face,and there is a gum in my table linen?"}
{"text":"I had the American burger and my boyfriend had the Uber Cheese Burger...Great burgers...great service at the bar! The line was long but moved fairly quickly...glad we went!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Vegas for a work-cation at the beginning of June.  We went to all three of Ramsay's restaurants, and I think this one was my least favorite :(  It just struck me as being the \"view the rest of the world has of America\"  --without the oversized portions.  I get it- it's all burgers.... fatty, juicy large and obnoxious burgers.  the roasted Jalapeño poppers were alright, not my thing but they had a good flavor, and my husband like them alot.  I had the American burger and truffle fries, hubby had the farm burger and sweet potato fries.  He liked his fries most, I didn't like mine.  His burger was alright, mine had no taste :(    Chalk it up to different strokes for different folks, but I really was not impressed.... american burgers?  I've been an american all my life and I think they are a horrible representation of all things american :/"}
{"text":"Had an incredible lunch here. Had the American and the Brittania Burgers.   Brittania Burger was by far the winner.  Incredible taste and combo of sweet/savory.  The Maui onion rings were on par too.  Loved the chipotle mayo and cheddar ranch.  Our server was absolutely top notch.  Though it took our food a little while to get to table, she checked in, made small talk, and helped the time pass so nicely, we barely noticed.  Highly recommend this."}
{"text":"Went here as it was close and convenient. Definitely does dot deserve the 4 stars it has on Yelp. Also I feel like GR would be disappointed with the horrible service and ambiance.   Burger and fries were great. However it was so loud and our server was so quiet that it was impossible to hear anything he said and he couldn't hear us. We ordered as soon as we sat down, but the burgers took close to 25 min to arrive. It also felt like a cafeteria.   Ok if you are close and need mid-priced food, but certainly not worth making a walk out of your way for."}
{"text":"Loved BurGR! My husband visited on our most recent Vegas trip, and we were very pleased. My hubby got the mushroom burger I don't remember the name but he loved it. And I had the hog burger, which was juicy and had a really good smokey pork flavor. My all time favorite though were the truffle fries and homemade ketchup and garlic aoli sauces. They are very addicting!   The atmosphere is clean and organized here, and the wait staff were great. We say right in front of the cool fire display.  I regret not trying the milkshakes, they looked really good. I will have to visit again and order one next time!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had the meat was thick and juicy the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they just didn't have ketchup they had 4 different ketchups but when my table asked for the original ketchup it was seasoned overall best burger"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay is known for perfection and doesn't take anything less than that and after hearing he had a restaurant in Vegas during my visit, I knew I had to try it and see his take on dining! This place instantly captures your attention boasting fire and flames shooting in a wavy pattern seen through glass with his logo name written in front of it. The place is trendy and modern with people being seated and served and food runners that seemed to be running around like clockwork. Upon watching this happen while waiting in line, I was also super hungry so I was more than ready to eat here!  Beautiful tables, silverware, and cool square and wavy plates was what we were met with when were finally seated. The menu was foldable and wrapped around our silverware napkins. After looking at a cliche picture of mr Ramsay himself on the unfolding menu, I perused all the juicy sounding burgers and we ordered.  We started off with the jalapeño poppers, in came with 6, and they all were served in their own square shot glass that had a white fiery sauce with a squirt of red hot sauce in them. Lets just say I wasn't prepared for these because I bit into them instantly and seconds later was asking for more water to cool my mouth down! The restaurant read my mind because before I had a chance, my glass was being refilled and refilled again, they must know this is common when people order these, I mean there place has fire everywhere and it's Hell's Kitchen, I am not surprised! The waiter also told us after that one of the poppers was secretly spicier than the others, kind of like a Russian roulette type of deal which I thought was neat and innovative and I'm pretty sure I got that one!  Next the burgers.....oh man, nothing short of amazing. Fresh buns, perfectly melted cheese, fresh ingredients, perfectly cooked meat. Everything seemed to just melt in my mouth as it was the perfect balance of flavor. I opted for the Hell's Kitchen burger which wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be. It had tomato, avocado, peppers, and cheese. My date got the arugula and goat cheese burger which I tried and it was just as delicious. I was highly pleased eating them as we munched on our garlic fries with a side of homemade ketchup and truffle mayonnaise dipping sauces on the side. The fries were great but a little heavy on the seasoning.  Being in Vegas, these prices were very reasonable (~$12-$16 a burger) and it left us with plenty of money aside to use for gambling! This place did not disappoint at all and it was the perfect way to start off the night! Gordon Ramsay knows how a restaurant should be run and this place is a prime example!"}
{"text":"Wait wasn't too bad and our server was awesome. Started with the pork belly hot pockets and they were ok. Had the Hell's Kitchen burger and shared the ooey gooey fries. The burger was really really good- great flavor. Fries were good- love an over easy egg on top of anything. Wish they were skinny fries. My friend had the fish sandwich and almost had a mouth orgasm. Lol. Other friend had the the triple cheeseburger and ate it in like 60 seconds it was so good."}
{"text":"Went to this place in Oct 2014 .. guess this review was long due !  When its a place which is associated with a celebrated chef like Gordon Ramsey - I guess reviews dont matter much! .. so here is a short one ..  IMP TIP: I was staying at the Cosmo and this place was right opposite to the Cosmo - so we could reach here when the place was opening for Lunch - had a 5 mins wait .. BUT as soon as we sat .. we could see the cue getting longer by the minute! So go here early - if you dont wanna wait... anyways in Vegas most folks dont get up before noon! :)  The FOOD: EXCELLENT - INTELLIGENT - UNIQUE ..  The meat quality in my burger was just awesome and exactly the way I had ordered  - medium -rare - but It was the toppings - the bread - the veggies and the overall presentation that made the difference! .. Also they have probably the most INSANE chili hod dog in the world !  Dont miss their milk shakes !!"}
{"text":"This is not the first time I been to this place. If you are successfully get a table and get served with food. You will probably rate a 5 stars for their food. For my experience I waited 20 mins in the line and got seated at the bar. (SERIOUSLY DONT TAKE THE BAR) we ended up waiting for 1 hour and leave without any food!!!! We have talked to the server and he doesn't seem to be helpful whatsoever."}
{"text":"Great burger! The farm burger was cooked perfectly.  Very happy with the burger. Service was very nice too!"}
{"text":"Let's just start off by saying that this was the best burger I've ever tasted. Damn it was good.  I have a severe nut allergy, so I tell every restaurant I eat at about how important segregation is. Of course there weren't any nuts in my burger, but it makes segregation in the kitchen vitally important.   My burger was perfect. Absolutely perfect.   However, my girlfriend found a ravioli in her burger... Worse news is that they don't even serve pasta. The server was dumbfounded. The chef was apologetic. It ruined her apatite thinking that the ravioli was probably someone's lunch. The chef told us it would be impossible considering that the cooks are not allowed to eat \"on the line\". Right on... But where did he pasta come from? What if the pasta was a nut, but in my burger. Two \"what ifs\", but if something not on the menu made it into a burger then why not?  They comped the burger which was fine, but my girlfriend leaving unsatisfied made our overall experience not worth it."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay all the way!! He fu**ing knows what hes' doing!! :D Good range of not so usual burgers and great tasting too........without a doubt! Got chicken wings for the toddler and they were oh so good...! This place is like fine dinning burger joint :) The shakes here are so indulgent that we went for a second helping!!! Needs a big appetite to guzzle everything down! The wait staff is genuinely friendly and ambience is hip."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to hit this joint before going to the airport to catch our flight home.  We ordered the American Burger and the Blue Burger, with fries.    The food was excellent.  The dipping sauces for the fries were unique and tasty, and the burgers were very well prepared (and just plain delicious).  The downside: Service.  Despite being seated within two minutes of arriving, our server appeared very distracted.  After receiving our food (from a person different than our server), she never - and I mean never - came back to check on us to see how we were doing and whether we liked the food.  She only showed up to clear the plates and drop off the bill.  If she had just paid a bit more attention to us, the tip would have been 25% (or more), and not just 15%.  I wanted to respond to the survey they offered at the time we were paying (to provide feedback on the service), but the device they have for taking the survey (it looked like an iPhone or iPad) was not working.  I checked their website, and there is no \"Contact Us\" link to use to provide feedback.  This is a great place to go for some great food.  However, they need to improve their service."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this restaurant several times but their success is showing by the attitude of the staff. After waiting for a spot at the bar I was greeted by the bartender James by did you check in with the hostess? You can't just us here. I did check I and was told I could take the fist available seat. Normally an iPad is given to you for a drink selection. Not this time, I was given the food menu right away. When asked if I could get a drink I received a Rolling of the eyes and an iPad. Hopefully the food will be better than the attitude!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Service was even better  I would recommend this place to everyone  the wait for a table was about 20 minutes but worth every minute of it  Our server Tammy was great"}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks back for a bachelor's party.   Holy guacamole!!!  The burger here is SOOO good. Everyone here ordered a variety of burgers and three orders of truffle fries. Everything here is high quality and deserving of a 5 star. The meat was thick, cooked just right (medium rare). The fries, topped with a generous about of ketchup and some sort of delicious green sauce of some sort. The environment, friendly, inviting, and very comfortable. Chef Ramsey definitely overdid this one in Vegas. I usually would not pay $15 for a burger, but for this? I'll gladly pay this amount!!"}
{"text":"The Euro burger and shake I had was fantastic.  Really good food and much more reasonable priced than many other places in Vegas.  Also far more convenient getting here than In-N-Out."}
{"text":"This had to be one of the top 2 burgers I have had. Jalipanio Burger. The staff dressed great, sweet potato fries almost tasted like candy complimenting the burger. Mouthwatering goodness! The service was okay I was expecting it to be better considering. It w l d be nice if the servers picked the table up throughout the burger experience. Would defiantly reccomend and visit again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in 30 minutes before closing on a late Saturday night. Was expecting to get hurried service and mediocre food, but I was pleasantly surprised. Ambiance was great, food was great, service was EXCELLENT!  Alex with glasses was our server and he was one of the best waiters we have ever had. I started with a great beer recommendation, then followed with the hummus appetizer, truffle fries, and two burgers. Overall I was happy with the food, but I did feel like the burgers were lacking just a little. Too much emphasis on being fancy and not enough on flavor. 4 out of 5, not bad at all.  Extremely happy with the service though, and would stop by the place again just because of that."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, especially the gooey fries (hand cut fries + vintage white cheddar + smoked gouda cheese + toscano salami + over easy egg). Totally worth the wait to be seated! Everyone in our group seemed to enjoy their meal. I had the Southern Yardbird Burger. It was very flavorful."}
{"text":"This review is a year late. Finally decided to see what BurGR was all about. After seeing a line out the door the first few nights of our stay in Vegas we decided to show up a little before they opened to check it off the list. The place runs smoothly-kudos to the staff.  The burgers sounded interesting but were actually really bland. The only thing that will bring me back are the jalapeno poppers. Not only were they absolutely delicious they were beautifully presented.   I wouldn't be upset if I never made it back."}
{"text":"The place is good with beautiful waitresses and the food is amazing! The cocktails were good too especially the slimy screw...wow! Must go for the cute waitresses at least ;-)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Farm Burger.  It had duck bacon and a fried egg on it.  I ordered it mid-rare and it came out perfectly cooked.  I liked it but I didn't love it like I'd expected.  It lacked saltiness. Maybe the egg yolk got in the way of the duck bacon flavor. Truffle Parmesan fries were good but the parmesan became a separate entity as it didn't stick to the fries.  It just flaked off.  The sauces that came on the side were delicious. The chicken wings were underwhelming.  I couldn't taste enough wasabi and not enough 'hellfire'.  My buddy ordered the Chanterelle Burger, mid-rare and it came out well done.  That pretty much ruined the flavor it might have had.  We couldn't taste the figgy onion jam it was supposed to have had.  We didn't make a fuss, nor did we want to wait for another burger to be made correctly.  My kids each had the Standard Dawg.  Huge and DELICIOUS!  Yay!  They are cooked differently than any dawg I've had.  Some kinda wiener magic happening there.  The bun was cool, too.  Kinda like a pretzel.  The best part of the meal was the Butterscotch Pudding and Banana Shake.  LOVED this.  And I don't even love shakes, ever.  This was fanf*ckingtastic.  It comes in a tall, slender glass, topped with a big layer of pudding, fresh whipped cream and a snickerdoodle cookie.  Every single layer of flavor worked outrageously well together.  I would go back just for this.  In fact, I'd try all the other shakes, too.  Service was fine.  Our waitress seemed like a pleasant automaton.  I like that the kitchen is open so you can see them working in there.  I wish I had been more impressed with the burgers."}
{"text":"First of all, as a designer I would like to say it's very well branded and the attention to the details is noticeable (by me at least haha) ! From the moment you sit at your table, you have a sneak peek at a juicy potential burger on the back of your neighbours menu and the logo on your own. Open it up and see Mr Ramsay excited to show you his (or I guess his head chef's) finely crafted menu. Even the cutlery resembled flames! Having knowledgeable and attentive staff as well all added to an overall excellent atmosphere.  The one peeve I had though was the line to get in. There is a sign that tells you to speak to the hostess before lining up. There is a line to do that apparently. We speak with her and she says just line up in the original line... But by then, couple parties have gotten in front of where we would've been! A bit later while waiting in the line, another girl then proceeded to take the number of people in our party... What's up with that? Either take names at the beginning and give an eta, or make that bs sign gfto!   Enough of that... It's onto the food. We had onion rings and truffle fries to start. Both were nice. Just nice. I loved the sauces they came with as well,though I thought the truffle was a little too strong in the truffle  sauce. I cannot remember what the name of the burger I ate was..(it had mango chutney) , but it was quite good. The patty was made to perfection... However, I barely tasted any mango. It was only a couple bites at the center of the burger where I got those flavours.  So based on my experience, I definitely might go back again to try the other choices! Assuming they do something with that useless signage instructions in the line."}
{"text":"The food and service were definitely good and price wise for a celebrity chef restaurant it was affordable.  Nice decor as well.  We got the hummus for appetizer...it was good...not great not bad although, I preferred the pita to the veggie sticks with it. The kale granny apple salad was good too but, not a standout. The hubby got the fish and chips sandwich...it was massive and he enjoyed it.  I would give this place 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Wings are awesome, skip the honey wasabi and get the hot ones. Chili dog was legit! Farm burger (sharp cheddar, duck breast bacon, fried egg) was delicious; probably would have enjoyed it more if i wasn't already stuffed.  Definitely worth the Vegas lunch visit."}
{"text":"Hells Kitchen burger and Jalapeño poppers are amazing!  only thing that could have made it better was a Dos XX!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I ever had, juicy and lots of flavor . Long line but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I went once and probably wont do it again.  first, it took us a long time to have a waitress to take our orders and then to get orders done. also, I asked for well-done burger but it came not so I had to wait for another order. the burgers were ok! nothing special in them. I ordered pudding which was very thick and heavy I had stomach ache all that day and spend my day visiting toilets! and I think it is from the pudding."}
{"text":"When Gordon Ramsay's name is attached to a restaurant, I admittedly expect a little bit better food than the usual. Perhaps I fell for the hype and believed more than I should've (probably not), but this place just wasn't great.  Starting off with the sweet potato fries was the best choice of the meal as they were delicious. More crispy than the average and served with powdered sugar and a sweet dipping sauce, these fries might be the best I've had (and what gave this place three instead of two stars).  When I ordered the Farm Burger, I believed the wisdom of Yelp and expected something spectacular. What I was served was a huge letdown. The fried egg was delicious but it was more poached than fried. The duck bacon seemed like it should be good, but it lacked a distinctive flavor. And the patty, while cooked to a perfect medium, lacked seasoning and sear.  Put together, the burger was just bland: the salty bacon never had enough punch for the under-seasoned patty.   Overall, for a meal that fits most budgets ($15 for the burger, $9 for the fries), Burgr works; however, the entire experience wasn't consistent. Great fries, bland burger, don't think I'd go again.   P.S. The Farm Burger absolutely pales in comparison to the Niman Ranch Burger from Evan Funke when he was at Rustic Canyon (still the best in my book)."}
{"text":"Went here awhile ago. I loved Ramsey and the food is good but sad to say all you're getting is standard food at a premium price. You're paying nearly double for the Ramsey brand for the same tasting food you could get elsewhere or cook at home. The waiter was very nice  though did wait 5 minutes for refill even after notifying him prior.  Edit:I have to add that the TVs during our dinner had feet on then. I thought it was a commercial but it was there every time I looked. Not good for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for Christmas and who doesn't want to try a Gordon Ramsey restaurant?* (this is a debatable statement)*  Ambience: (4/5) it can get a bit loud, but that's to be expected considering the fact that it's in a casino and the first restaurant you see when you go through the doors of  Planet Hollywood. There are enough flat screens to keep you entertained while you wait for your food (which takes a bit of time) but it's not so loud that you can't hear the person across the table.   Service: (4.5/5) our waitress was very friendly and our drinks came quickly. They are also very attentive to you and drink refills are quick and well-timed. As for the burgers, it took a while but it was okay because it was for a party of 5 and all our burgers came at the same time.   Food: (5/5) the good part of coming here with a party of 5 is that everyone can order a different burger and you get to try a little bit of everything (given that your family/friends aren't being a stingy scrooge). Each burger is worth every dollar you're paying for it and the milkshakes are aaamazing!! The truffle fries are delicious like other reviews have stated (but it feels a bit overhyped to me)."}
{"text":"The shakes are the highlight here. The burgers are clearly high quality with subtle flavors, but left a little to be desired for me. Truffle fries are good, but I preferred the sweet potato fries. The honey jalapeño that came with the sweet fries and the aioli and ketchup that comes with the truffle fries are very good.  I'd give them 5 stars on the shakes. 3-4 on the fries and 4 on the burgers. Overall, 3.5 stars but round up to 4 stars to be fair.  That said, my standards are fairly high.  If McDonalds or Wendy's is your standard, then this kills it.  If you're looking for the best burger ever, then keep looking."}
{"text":"I do not like hamburgers, but this is place has the best one I tasted. The farm burger (the one with the egg) was awesome! The fries and the dipping sauces were equally good. I will be coming back for sure. The staff were very friendly, I was asked if I wanted to dine at the bar, and i said yes, and they moved us out of the long wait line."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this but this joint is over rated.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen and it came a little lukewarm and on a closer note to being cold. The beef patty was decent but not say fantastic.  For the price and location, I really expected more.  Had the truffle fries too and again it was cold and soggy. Overall a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, the Hells Kitchen burger was the best I have EVER had. I have had many burgers from lots of well known places but this one takes the [burger] cake. This is a must go if you are in the area. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever eaten!!! I tried the hog burger which had juicy, tender beef with a hint of sweetness. I didn't have high expectations of it and thought it would be overrated, but I'm glad I was proven wrong! The truffle fries are also to die for! My friends also tried the Ramsay burger and they loved it too. Would definitely recommend anyone who's visiting Vegas to dine here! I had lunch at noon and only waited for 10 minutes. However, we noticed that the line had lengthened a lot after we were done eating... So go early to avoid waiting!!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey needs to save his own kitchen.  The burgers and fries we got were less than subpar.  They were room temperature and the fries were barely warmer than that.  Not worth the money at all.  Save your time and money and go somewhere else.  Truly a disappointment."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger, gooey fires, and the #4 shake(creme brûlée shake).   The burger had just the right amount of spiciness for me(probably not spicy for people who love spicy foods) and it had the perfect amount of moisture that you'd want from a burger.  The gooey fries are really good and the portion is huge. The gooey fries are enough to share between 3-4 people.  The creme brûlée shake is without a doubt the best shake i have ever had. This shake is a must have.  The service was quick and the workers are very friendly."}
{"text":"First off it took an over an hour for our food to get there, making Ramsay a total hypocrite. He would have verbally assaulted himself if it were on one of his TV shows. The service was good, pretty simple menu. Which is the thing that bothers me if your going to have a simple menu it better be great food, and it just wasn't. Sweet pickles on a burger does not make it any classier. I don't care who you are or how classy you think you are, ketchup belongs on the table at a burger restaurant. Overall this place has all the bells and whistles looks great, but the food is average at best, and the restaurant itself is unorganized. Gordan Ramsay sold out and put his name on a below average restaurant."}
{"text":"Crazy busy. Even on a sunday night the wait was 45 min (just to sit at the bar). The burgers were good, but spendy for what they were, even by vegas standards. the staff was hit and miss."}
{"text":"Went back after a year.  Had Alex again as our server.  Again...great service!  Food quality drops a bit but not by much.  A+ experience again!"}
{"text":"Great place to visit.  Great Burger! We went on a Saturday our party of 6 wait time was about and hour and a half.  Once we got it we had good service, I had the Jalepeno Poppers to start and a Farm Burger and Truffle Fries.  The poppers were great they had some heat.  The burger was good, I wish I new it didn't come with lettuce, tomato, onion etc.  The duck Bacon on ot was great tho.    The truffle fries were like steak fries.  Not a fan of steak fries, but they were good.   Only thing was my dad order a salad from a waiter that was not my our waiter.  The other waiter said he would put it in, but my dad never got it.  Good thing too cause he was full from the burger and fries."}
{"text":"where should i start ?  took 40 minutes to get my burger , Ok maybe there was a mix at the kitchen , ill let it slide .  taste was barely ok , Fries were hard as if a 2 day old fries that got re-heated. total was $28-   Burger , Fries & a soft drink .  What pissed me off was the heart burn i got , thru out the night had to have TUMS to try and help ...     You want a good burger in Vegas go to BACHI , hell, even go to 5 Guys, but do yourself a favor and SKIP Gordon Ramsay's BurGR .   I doubt Mr. Ramsay knows how bad those fries tasted , i have watched his Kitchen Nightmares show & the way he bashes food quality and taste , had i brought him his own fries he would have spit it right out ..."}
{"text":"Go here all the time. It is more affordable of Gordons restaurants. Love the green tea martini, truffle fries and any burger is good!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  You have to try the chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. If you go at regular dining times expect to stand in line but it doesnt really seem like it was that long maybe 20 min.? Anyway everytime we have ever went there the waut staff have been great!!! I am in love with the truffle oil fries. The aioli sauce that comes with it I am obssessed with, and the hamburgers,  well delicious. My favorite is the Jells burger. And pretty nice wine list. We tried the onion rings this time also those were pretty dang good. The table next to us had the jalapeno poppers and the way they serve them was so intriguing we are getting them next time. You get I believe it was 6, and they take all the seeds out except for one, its a SURPRISE. Anyway everything about this place is super cool, from the silverware to the attitudes of the employees. I wiuld give them 10 stars if I could. Try to go there 2 or 3 times a month."}
{"text":"This place was fun, tasty and lived up to the Gordon Ramsay name. My wife and I really enjoyed it. I had the \"Gordon Burger\" which is an off menu special. It was a good all around burger. My wife had the blueberry turkey burger with candied lemons which was tangy and refreshing - it sounds weird but it works! Best place we ate in our three day stay."}
{"text":"Onion rings were great! By far the best. I had the American burger and she had the the Earth burger, Which I tried. Both were mediocre and trying to hard to be different and good. The Earth burger was a bit too salty and oily. The truffle fries are OK, but the \"just fries\" were over and under cooked (not cut all the same....). Save your money and go to Red Robin, it doesn't have the name but has better burgers and fries. Sorry ramsay, we are still huge fans, wish you could have cooked our meals for us! Side note, service for a burger took more than 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Perfect. Everything that we ordered was amazing. We for the fries with smoked Gouda on them and it was like eating a slice of heaven. I will definitely be back when we visit again. The only drawback is that rewards members are able to cut to the front for priority seating so even though we were next in line, several people came and were seated before us."}
{"text":"I honestly thought I was being filmed on an episode of kitchen nightmares..my dining experience was that bad. The outside was inviting...gassed fiery  flames lined the glass wall for guests to admire while waiting to get inside. Being a fan of Gordon I was thrilled, getting my picture taken outside of the restaurant, checking out the interactive menu searching for the perfect burger. It was my first time in Vegas and I thought BURGR would be the highlight. I would finally be able to taste the food that I had been lacking all my life. 45min-1hr wait in line later while watching his hostesses clad in unimpressive tight red polyester 60s looking roller skating dresses with skateboard running shoes without socks and lacy cup of bra peeping out walk up and down the lineup asking people their names and telling everyone front of line to back that the wait would be only 15 min, a lie. I am 32, mother is 52 I have eaten many a restaurant meal and consider myself a foodie. We were sat and handed a cardboard menu. 15 min later we were met by a female in darker clothing and again skateboard runners without socks. We ordered our drinks a Pepsi and diet Pepsi. Looking at the menu I was unimpressed that everything was a la carte, u mean you order a hamburger for  $15 and you do not get fries? In all of his tv shows u always get fries after all what is a burger without fries.  I looked around and realized most of the people settled on splitting one fry for the both of them after all the fry cost another 11-14 dollars!!! For fries!!!!  By this point I was thinking this was going to be the best burger of my life!!!!!   20-30mins later no drinks we were parched it was 118degrees outside in Vegas and we hadn't even received water let alone our drinks.  The hostess did a double take, we had not received our drinks!!! She apologized and asked if we had ordered them yet as if that was a question, we said yes about 5minutes later a bus boy brought them to us.   10-minutes later the hostess came by and apologized and made up the excuse of not getting our drinks as the waitress we had was pregnant and had to eat between serving meals really? well I thought at least someone was eating, not their guests though.   Finally our waitress appeared  to take our order seemingly unfazed and unaware that our drink order had been issued by a bus boy.I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger, my mother the classic burger, we split the truffle Parmesan  fries. My mother ordered her burger well done...she said she did not like any pink in hers..I ordered mine and I quote..well.well.well.well.well.done.I like my burger hot, no pink...the waitress said she will write it down for cooks. In hindsight we were making excuses upon excuses for the restaurant service...but at that point we were just excited to receive our meals...our stomachs hungry from the wait......and wait.....and wait..another hour later we were finally served...again by the poor bus boy...who tried to smooth it over with a smile....at this point I was relieved we were even served...actually by this point the excitement was gone...but we made more excuses for the restaurant....because it was going to be delicious right?  We first took pictures with our burgers...I honestly felt bad..the poor pathetic burger all alone on its plate...just sitting there...unimpressive really....my poor mother was excited...see she had lettuce and tomato on hers so it appeared bigger...but I knew better.....poor mom. The 14 dollar fries came in a cone.   After the pictures we each cut our burger in half. I saw pink in mine...gulp...but seeing I wanted my mother to have a good experience I swallowed my disappointment...up until she said....oh my god..my burger is bleeding on my plate....my heart sunk....noooooo...I knew my mother would not eat hers. I guess our faces gave it away because the hostess came over and asked if we liked our burgers...my mom said she could not eat hers..it was rare...I didn't say anything about mine..I felt bad for my mom...but mine was also pink...hostess got manager...manager came over and asked..if we like our burgers? My mother said hers was bleeding onto the plate..manager picked up plate..my mom didn't wanna wait another hr for burger..I didn't wanna eat alone...what about the fries? They would be cold...I was mad...I told the manager we expected more from a restaurant especially from Ramsey's restaurant...I pointed to sign...BURGR. She said she would fix the burger and walked away. I ate my burger...it was bland..not hot or spicy ..the bun was soggy..the burger soft..no taste..I think I ate one hint of jalapeño on whole thing..our fries were gross...melted with Parmesan and salted to the point that my mouth was feeling raw...the manager returned with my moms burger and new fries...she ate in silence...I was already done my meal...I felt bad....even worse when the waitress returned with our bill which totalled $49 for 2 burgers and one fry-total wait time approx. 3h u decide"}
{"text":"We had to wait in line for about 10 mins before being seated as it was very crowded on a Tuesday afternoon.   The menu is fairly small but it's a burger place. The onion rings are really good and I liked them better than the regular fries which were a little thick for my tastes.   The burger was amazing. I had to add one of the chipotle ketchup's to my burger which added to the flavor. The buns are amazing, soft and fresh.  The pricing is reasonable for this area. Our waiter was really nice too. I'll add this to my list of must eat places every time I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I knew we had to come to this restaurant while in Vegas over the weekend - we walked by a few times and saw the line was always 30 people deep. We decided to join the queue at 10:30 one morning for the 11AM opening of the restaurant. We were the second group to get in line. We probably would have been fine getting in line at 10:45, but there were 5 of us dining and they didn't have a lot of tables for groups larger than 4.  We sat down and the waitress came over pretty soon to describe the menu, suggest some burgers, appetizers, and beer. She was excellent throughout the meal.  We put in our appetizer order: the Five Spice Chicken Sliders, Fury Wings, and Jalapeno Poppers.  I would highly recommend the wings and poppers, the sliders were good, not excellent.  As for the burgers, everyone ordered something different and everyone said it was the best burger they've ever had.  I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which came loaded with roasted jalapeno peppers, roasted tomatoes, some avocado to cut the heat, and asadero cheese. The burger was out of this world, but certainly had a lot of heat from the jalapenos.  Other people with me got the Farm Burger, Chanterelle Burger, Hog Burger, and Euro Burger.  All of the burgers were cooked perfectly our preferred temperature.  We also split an order of the truffle fries and sweet potato fries. The truffle fries were excellent. The sweet potato fries were average (but not generally my cup of tea).  For dessert we shared the coffee shake and chocolate shake. The shakes were delicious!  I would highly recommend a stop here for lunch while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The service was the saving grace. We sat at the bar, and the initial bartender was friendly and helpful, and made some suggestions. There was a shift change while we were there waiting for our food, and the second bartenders were less helpful and friendly, but still prompt enough.   The food itself was no better than any other truck stop burger place. The meat patty was thick, but I couldn't tell whether or not the quality of meat was any better than my local $4 diner joint or not, as it had no flavor, and lacked juice. The bun was dry, almost stale, and the(lack of) fixings on the burger were terrible. I ordered the blue cheese burger. It comes with a small wilted sprinkling of greens on top of the melted blue cheese, which by the way, completely overpowers the flavor of the burger. Nothing else. Don't get me wrong, I love blue cheese, but I should be able to taste the meat. And, for $15 for an ala carte burger, I would have expected far superior quality than a stale bun, confusing flavor and texture. For the price and boastfulness of Gordon Ramsay, they should have added some chartreuse pickles, a tomato slice, a house made stone ground mustard (or any sauce for that matter), or some fries.  We did order the \"just fries\", and they were not well prepared. Inside the fry funnel were some oversized, undercooked (terrible inconsistent texture) fries; some squishy with oil, and some burnt. If adding a little cumin to the fries is supposed to make them fancy enough to cost $8, I would re-think the quality at which they were coming from the kitchen. What an embarrassment.  If I were a world renowned chef, I wouldn't put my name on products as poor as this.   The staff outfits were another train wreck. The body tight (and motion restrictive) miniskirt dresses on the hosts and servers were not at all attractive, and even though we were in Vegas where the objectivity of women is for some reason socially acceptable, it was to say the least, not helping the atmosphere of the restaurant. The outfits (required matching sneakers, jeans, and awful poly blend fabrics), looked like something straight out of the late 90s, tricking me into thinking I was on the set of Friends.  The end result, several hours later, I was gifted the unfortunate surprise of severe stomach cramps and a case of the trots, and two days later I am still suffering. Not what I expect from an upscale \"burgr\" restaurant."}
{"text":"So disappointed! !! My boyfriend and I where there yesterday for lunch. It was a 2 hourwait so we taught that it was going to be an amazing experience.  I was very excited to eat there since I am a fan of chef Ramsay. I ordered the hell's kitchen burger, very over cooked and no seasoning at alllllllll! my boyfriend ordered a burger with arugula and goat cheese. .he had the same problem with his burger.  Our server wasn't attentive and didn't check on us at all. We couldn't even bring our issues to their attention since everyone was just standing by the pos machines talking to each other. Worst vegas experience ever. Never again :( I want my money and time back! !!!"}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious! I love their curry ketchup dip that came with the french fries. The onion rings had a nice crunch to it as well. We had the Euro burger - YUMM! The truffle aoli with goat cheese sauce adds a nice kick to the burger. At one point my friend's eyes rolled back because his burger was just that good!   Service-excelllent! But I do wonder why the servers were all males while the bussers were female."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  Came for lunch, loved everything.    It should be a Vegas institution."}
{"text":"Ashley was AMAZING! We came in with a group of 10 for a birthday dinner last night, which is a fairly large group for a Saturday night. Ashley was incredibly friendly and on top of everything. Some of the best customer service I've received in a long while! (Plus the food is obviously SO delicious)"}
{"text":"Liked it a lot. Had never tried a burger with egg, but this was good. Line was long but moved pretty quickly. Service was a little slow but understandable since it was busy."}
{"text":"Decor, nice Service, slow and ungracious Food, mediocre Value, overpriced for what you get  Gordon Ramsey should be forced to eat every meal here. Me, I'm going to save myself some money next time and go to Smashburger."}
{"text":"We had dinner early at 5+pm but the place was already 90% filled.   We ordered a Hell's Kitchen burger ($15) and a Farm Burger ($14). Both were great (although we thought they would have been even better if we had ordered medium rare instead of medium). I personally loved the Farm Burger as the duck bacon & mushrooms were really flavourful.   We also got a Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11) which tasted so good! They were thick cut fries with really good homemade sauces (truffle + ketchup). We couldn't finish it due to the giant portion.   Overall, this is definitely worth visiting and we actually went back the next day but the line too long during the usual dinner hours (from 6.30pm onwards)."}
{"text":"At last got to try Gordon Ramsey Burgr restaurant.  As with the names -  all burgers ordered were prepared and cooked to perfection.  The Jalapeno poppers a must try also. Various beef burgers are delicious.   Hog burger is very nice too being different / not typical. Tried truffle fries and Gooey fries.  While the truffle fries is very good and fragrant, the Gooey fries there is not so much to brag about. Finally tried the oreo shake.... this too taste lovely to end a great meal.  As for the service, the place provides good service from start to finish.  Friendly people, checking on table few time throughout despite a place is very busy.  Keep the water filled too.  Ambiance is a bit too loud for our tasting between music, people talking, kitchen, etc. Note: I expect utensils to perfection being a Gordon Ramsey restaurant but still notice dry water Mark from the washed.  Overall experience were great and will visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to taste the food.  Horrible service and waited for 30 minutes to have them screw up the order.  Nobody ever came and let us know how long the food was going to take or check on us.  Would not wait anymore and when I talked with the \"Manager\" he didn't listen.  Attitudes from all the employees were bad and I wish Gordon Ramsay was there so I could fire him!"}
{"text":"we were the forth couple in line at 11 am. very,very long wait. fries were extremly salty, my burger was over done and bland.i would have sent it back but the wait staff never came over to check untill i was almost done.  we ate about half the fries and my gilfriend found a hair. while waiting on the waitress and the manager a light fixture fell out of the ceiling at the table next to us. the manager finally came over and tried to explain it wasnt a hair it was something off the potato bag?? and they were tring to resolve it with the vendor??? dont they wash the contents first?? they did take off the fries on the bill... dis reguard the hype ... i wont go back."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT... Gordon Ramsay has his staff n service people held to the high standards of himself. Food was great. I had the hell's kitchen burger, awesome... The wings as an appetizer, great... Onion rings, thumbs up.. Totally great experience.. We're in Vegas at least 3 times a year n this will always be on our list of great places to eat. Highly recommend.. Bloody great mate...."}
{"text":"Exxxxpensive! Yes, it's Gordon Ramsay and all, but $103 for 3 burgers, 1 fish & chip sandwich, 1 order of fries, 3 soft drinks and 1 beer is ridiculous. My family and especially my two sons are big fans of GR, but he's awfully proud of his prices. He must have Vegas confused with London, because he's charging in Pounds, and I'm not talking weight.   The burgers were tasty and my son's fish & chip sandwich was a hoot - it's a full piece of fish served in what I would call Sizzler's finest Texas toast. The fries come with a curry ketchup and BBQ ketchup - both are great. The wait staff are terrific, especially the guy with the 12\" tall Mohawk. I can't remember his name, but he took pictures with us and was genuinely a nice guy.   Other than the price, the only thing I can complain about is the hostess staff. They treat you like crap - you're just a number to them. They have no personality and make no effort to get you excited about the meal - give me you cell number and we'll text you. NEXT!"}
{"text":"Went here and ordered the fish sandwich and my husband ordered the american burger and fries. The fish arrived sitting on top of a roll that was split but didn't envelope the fish, some tiny shredded potatoes that were supposed to taste of vinegar and salt sat on top. there was globs of dill tarter sauce that ran off the fish and down the bread. The presentation looked good till I tried to eat it. It was very sloppy. Then it got worse , no flavor, very bland and the batter on the fish was soggy. The burger was very dry. It was pretty but thats where it ended, took us for $46 dollars.  should've went to  Hubert Keller's burger bar for the lobster burger at Mandalay bay.  yum!!!     must I give it 1 star to write this. only to save someone from this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Prepared from scratch and savory. The burgers are on the small side so expect quality and not quantity. They have a good variety of burgers to choose from. You do, however, have to buy the fries separately and they too taste great. A+ customer service especially from the manager. My first time going, several years back, reservations were placed days prior. The day of, an event was going on and we were told they were closed to the public. They knew the mistake was on them for taking our reservation and the manager invited us to come on a different day. When that day came the manager apologized, had a friendly chat with us, and comped our entire meal for 3 with dessert. Of course we left a generous tip but what restaurant does that now a days? It's rare and that experience made us lifetime customers."}
{"text":"SORRY, LAST TIME I WILL GO HERE!  This three star rating is probably not really fair to this restaurant, BUT,  here is the reasoning.  My family and I went for lunch, about a one and one half hour happening.  We valet parked our two cars, went to the restaurant.  The service and staff were gracious and very helpful their suggestions for lunch were great, the food and drinks were all prepared and served perfectly.  What you may ask causes the problem???  When we went to pick up our cars we were faced with a bill for $26.00 plus an expected tip to park the two cars for 90 minutes.  This is REDICULIOUS and will make sure this local will no longer frequent this or any other portion or subcontractor of Planet Hollywood or Caesars on the strip!!!  I sincerely hope ALL locals will cease to support the obvious price gouging by the Hotel/Casino industry."}
{"text":"10 minute wait to be seated for us. The host will text you when your table is ready which is cool. Farm Burger with crispy duck bacon and egg is the way to go. Wife prefers the Euro Burger. Ordered medium and received medium rare but we are brave. Buns were good and not soggy even with medium rare meat and egg drippings. Wife loved onion rings and ranch dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Love it! A bit of a wait, but worth it. The food is great, shakes are great, try the sweet potato fires.... awesome!"}
{"text":"Great place and great atmosphere!! The bigger I had was amazing I ordered it medium rare and it was perfect and juicy.. I ordered the Parmesan fries which where so yummy I went back the next day just to get some more! Staff are friendly and never once kept us waiting. Must try will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Most delicious and unique burgers I've ever eaten..so far :) I love the concept of familiar comfort foods with an innovative flair!! It's like, \"Hey, I know you. I've loved you since I was a wee lass!\"  But as soon as you tuck in, it's like, \"BAM!! Oh, man! You're NOT the same ol same!! -- And I kinda really like it!!! ;)\" TRUE STORY.  We had the farm burger and hog burger (both PERFECT!), truffle friessssss, and the Oreo shaaake OMG O_o *in love*  In short- fantastic food, awesome service to boot, reasonable price, cool hip venue, and a 45min wait. I'LL BE BACK!! And I can't wait... :)))"}
{"text":"Had the Britannia burger it was good. the place was a little loud. Server was knowledgeable about items they offered. I would go back again!"}
{"text":"I have ate here many times today I drive 20 miles from were I live fight strip traffic just to have some girl tell me there closed with no reason I ask for the manger to see what she said it a private party. There are many  empty table and everyone is doing there own thing does not look like a party."}
{"text":"Lengthy line, would be nice if they took reservations.  The wait wouldn't not have bothered me if the food had lived up to the expectations we had for it.  This was the least favorite of the three Gordon Ramsay restaurants we went to on our recent trip.  We sat at the kitchen counter and it was fun to watch the staff work although it took a bit longer to get drink refills etc, even though we were passed by several waiters who were moving right past us. Christina Wilson was working the day we were there so that was a plus as we are huge Hell's Kitchen fans.  The manager Scott stopped by to see how we were doing, which was a nice touch.  My favorite part of the meal was the sticky toffee push up pops.  Those were divine."}
{"text":"Such a big fan of this place!! We did come at lunch time, so it was an hour and 15 minute wait. As soon as we were seated, we had excellent service. I got my water right away and they were always around to refill it. When we ordered our food, I loved that our waiter said we could have our fries come out before our burgers did, which I was so happy about because I came hungry. We ordered the Parmesan truffle fries which I really liked and a side of Maui onion rings, which I also recommend trying. Both are unique and you won't be disappointed with your order. The portions are definitely big enough to share, so keep that in mind. I ordered the American burger, which I also really liked. Everything about it was really good, there isn't anything I would have changed. I definitely want to go back and try the desserts, since I was too full to try it this time around. The service was great and it was an awesome atmosphere. So happy with my experience and I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes to be seated. Ordered in 2 minutes, waited for said order for 20 minutes. The burgers and fries are very tasty! Ordered the Euro Burger ,  Blue Burger , Parmesan Fries and Shake #5 ( I call it the Nutella Shake).  No server came back  to check on us. The shake never arrived.  Our waiter got sick and went home. We cancelled our shake order, eventually got our check, paid it and left. Never to return again!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Burgr, and I did. I loved the onion rings, side sauces,  the best ketchup I've ever had,  and amazing blood orange Cosmo.  But I was slightly disappointed wIth the Burger and fries.    I ordered the Britannia and truffle parmesan fries. My burger was cooked perfectly but less than half way through eating I was craving another element, a sauce perhaps or more combination of texture. My fries were fresh, warm and crisp but it was so crisp (overcooked) that all I taste was a lot of hard crunch with no potato.   My fiance ordered the Hell's Burger. Delicious but also missing moisture and flavor from a sauce. I understand gourmet meat is seasoned simply to compliment the proteins' natural flavor,  but put me over the top, don't just serve good burgers, make them great.   Wait time and service was not bad at all, compliments to the line and cooks, uniforms were quite $ not $$, overall go try for yourself."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this restaurant. The wait was so worth it. Can't remember what we got, but customer service was amazing and the food was even more amazing. Awesome job Gordon!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the burger and fries last night. Cooked to perfection. Definitely will visit again on my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic...think \"gourmet burger\". It'll run you around $14 or so for a burger but they are creatively put together and taste great. Salads and fries are amazing as well. The biggest complaint I have is that the wait can get excessively long and when you peek into the restaurant and see all the empty tables it can get frustrating. Not sure if they are just not properly staffing the place or the fact that the waitresses spend 10 minutes using an iPad to try to upsell you that is causing the delay, but all in all the service was just ok, while the food was great!"}
{"text":"The draft beer (Stella) was very dissapointing and the service was mediocre at best. The seats were about 2 inches too low making it very uncomfortable.  The saving grace is that the Hells Kitchen burger was great.  The fries were not bad either. The overall experience was not a a great one. Outside of the cool looking fire mural at the entrance the place is just another burger restaurant.  As an add on, both of us did not feel well even many hours after eating there."}
{"text":"BurGR has an upscale diner feel, but the burgers are nothing like diner burgers. The menu is smallish, but provide a variety of burgers for all tastes. The four that we had were all excellent, perfectly cooked and delicious. My wife ended up just eating the fish out of her burger/sandwich/whatever, and was very satisfied. The Parmesan Truffle Fries were really good, the plain fries were good too, but the dips they came with were fantastic. The curry ketchup (popular in Europe) was the best I've had, the chipotle ketchup was just hot enough to emphasize the flavors, and the garlic aoli was sublime. I suggest getting the Oreo shake, and skipping the toffee pudding push-pops. The Oreo shake is a full dessert, not a drink for sure, and worth it.  The pops are obviously a tie in to his signature dessert at Steak, but left me flat. Not worth it. The cocktails, despite the cool iPad menu, were nothing fantastic, but they were OK.  The service was average, and our waitress seemed a bit over-busy. Drink refills were slow coming, and she was pretty scarce most of the time. Our tip reflected that. Overall a very satisfactory experience, but eating here for lunch made dinner a hard decision, because no one was really hungry!  One caution...if you have back trouble or mobility issues, ask for one of the high tables. The regular table chairs are short (probably to raise the table height for diners) and very uncomfortable for tall people or folks with back problems."}
{"text":"First place we ate when we got to Vegas - place was busy even on a Tuesday night but our waiter never let us feel neglected.  I had the farm burger (w egg and duck bacon).  It was a tasty burger, but nothing spectacular.  What blew my mind was the sweet potato fries (with vanilla sugar) and the shake I had.  The shake was chocolate peanut butter with banana pudding on top and a ginger snap.  Easily the best shake I've ever had in my entire life.  With a bajillion dining options in Vegas this is the only place I plan to eat at twice in one visit - just to get another shake.  The only reason why I took one star away was cuz the burger itself while not bad wasn't as mind blowing as the side orders."}
{"text":"Good options on the menu but flavor did not match.  Fries were very over cooked."}
{"text":"Great Dogs and Burgers! Poor girls at the Hostess stand were freezing-a few feet from the door (It was in the low 40's)."}
{"text":"The single star is for the hosts! We got there at 9:30pm on Friday waited in line for 30 minutes. My brother was visiting us from out of town and once we reach the front of the line one of the host ask us how many in our party. I said three and she said that would be another 1&1/2 hour to be seated! Wow was I shocked. I asked her how come there was no one taking taking down party size in the line. She looked at me and with a blank stare and moved on and that's when she started going down the line asking for party size. I thought that was ridiculous so I asked another host that was standing behind the podium if we can sit at the bar. She was talking to a waiter and ignored us didn't even greet us. We waited until their personal conversation was done and finally she turns around and we asked her if we can sit at the bar and she said that's also 1&1/2 wait even though the bar had three patrons sitting there. These young, rude, incompetent hosts that they have working need to be trained in customer service.  This is a suggestion for Gordon Ramsay and management staff-  1. Fix the confusing line & make it more clear or have someone go through the line more often to ask about the party   2. Re-train these young, rude, incompetent hosts"}
{"text":"From one foodie to another, I mean it when I say this: THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD, YOU GUYS. SO GOOD.  Originally my group of 4 had planned to come here for dinner around 7. But when we arrived, were told that the wait would be at least an hour long. The good news was that they would text us right before our table was ready, so we were free to walk around the area (tip: shop around the Miracle Mile Shops!) to kill some time. The bad news was, we were on a time crunch, and didn't want to eat dinner in a hurry.  Instead, we came back for lunch the next day, around 12:30, and we only had to wait about 5 minutes for a table! Once seated, we were greeted by our incredibly gracious and knowledgeable waiter who seemed to know the menu inside and out. He recommended the crowd favorites, which include the Farm Burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and the Euro Burger.  All of the burgers sounded so mouthwatering-ly delicious, but I decided to be daring, and try the Euro Burger. Not everyone's cup of tea I'm sure, since it contains goat cheese, but I thought it was amazing. Anyway, the wait was longer than expected, which is the reason why I docked a star. They didn't seem understaffed on the floor, but it was definitely crowded at the prime lunch hour. It took about 20 minutes for us to receive our food, and maybe that's not exactly an eternity, but it kind of is when you're starving and breathing in that delicious beef aroma.  When the food finally came, all frustrations diminished. Every bite, from start to finish, was like a little piece of food heaven. Mind you, I don't consider myself a burger person at all (I do like to satisfy my In N Out craving every now and then), but this was definitely the juiciest, most perfectly-cooked burger that I've ever had the privilege of trying. The goat cheese wasn't overpowering at all, and in fact, complimented the burger quite nicely. I also tried the Parmesan truffle fries, which were yummy as well. The fries were good, but what made them amazing, was the truffle aioli dipping sauce. I was pleasantly stuffed by the end of the meal, and on what I can only describe as, a food high. Or food coma. Whatever tickles your fancy.  Despite the long wait, I think this place is worth the hype, and I'll definitely go out of my way to stop and eat here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Best onion rings of my life. They may have made me sick, but they were literally worth the stomach ache.  Vegetarians pretty much have one option for a main course. The Earth Burger is just a grilled portobello mushroom and some other stuff that I can't even remember. But whatever, it was so good. I usually hate portobello mushrooms, but I devoured this thing.  Service was okay. I didn't care because I was busy drooling.  Burgr is the only Gordon Ramsay restaurant that I can afford, but nothing about it felt like someone's cheapest restaurant. I took a menu home because it's epic."}
{"text":"Like many others who have reviewed this place have said, the service is shitty. We received our appetizer before anyone even bothered to bring our drinks out. The wrong drink was given to us twice in a row. The food took an extremely long time to come out, with three different waitresses helping us out over the course of the meal. When asking for a substitution on my earth burger, the girl said \"absolutely\" and nothing else. Upon receiving the bill, I saw that I was charged $3 for less than half an avocado. I don't mind being charged for it, but shouldn't she have said \"there will be a charge\" or something of the sort? Anyways, food was good, definitely not worth $18 after my massive substitution that took $3 of work to accomplish."}
{"text":"Second time here and still so good!!! Ginger and Justin rocked! We will be back!!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"NOT IMPRESSED! Waited 25 min in line and then, when we got to the front, they took our name and told us it would be another 30 min. What?!?!  My teenage sons and I ordered burgers and fries. All three of us said the same thing...AWFUL!!!!!   I would never go back.  UPDATE: I was so sick a few hours after eating here. It absolutely was food poisoning. AVOID THIS PLACE like the plague."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing! The taste of the burger and the dawg was delectable. The burger is a blend of different cuts of beef and the hotdog was in a natural casing that has a great snap. Both of which were cooked over an Applewood flamed grill. Now I think Gordon is just trying to add pizazz with the wood that is used to grill in order to justify the price you'll be paying;  but there's no need as I feel no matter what was used to grill it, the taste would've been the same.  My girlfriend and I came here with some of her workmates on a suggestion and I'll say that it was a great one.  My only gripe about the meal, was the bread and dipping condiments for the fries. Curry/chipotle ketchup? Let's not get all fancy and stick to something simple like just plain ketchup.  As for the hotdog, it wasn't even fully seated into the bun and I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork. My girlfriend had the American burger and it was just fine, except for the bun as well.  Both of which are given a brush a butter and toasted, and around the bun covered in sesame seeds but it's the outside texture that throws it off or what it would be to Americans-the crust.   At $14 being the average for just the main entree and having to order fries separately at $7, I think what you're mainly paying for is the presentation and the fact that you're dining at one of Gordon Ramsay's dining establishments. I do think you can have a burger of the same caliber elsewhere at a lesser cost, but you're in Vegas.  You'll be losing money at any table, even the one you're eating on; but here you'll leave feeling satisfied even though now your wallet is feeling lighter and your stomach now heavier."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for lunch.  We are both vegetarians which makes it difficult to find a good vegetarian burger.  The best part about this place is that they can make any burger vegetarian! Amazing service and delicious food! It is definitely the best burger we've had! Totally lives up to the Gordon Ramsey name!"}
{"text":"Best burger of my life. I got a new one he just made on his show 2 weeks ago. Like the farm burger but with pepper relish, avocado, shredded lettuce. So glad I stopped in. The staff is very upbeat and friendly. Will visit on another vegas trip for sure."}
{"text":"Had the hells kitchen burger... so oooooooo good!!! I would highly recommend this place! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"AMAZING! My family and I were really excited to go to BURGR and it did not disappoint! Our server was friendly and knowledgeable and made the experience that much better. The food was every thing I thought it would be. Burgers were moist, cooked perfectly and much bigger than the photos showed. The onion rings were the best I have ever had. Not a single thing about this place disappointed me!"}
{"text":"Yes, the food is pricey - it does have Gordon Ramsay's name on it after all. But of course it feels that way if you have been going to buffets every other meal. Here, you aren't paying for quantity, but quality.   We had the pork belly bao bun sliders, which were pretty good flavour wise - I would take off half a point for the texture of the bao bun. It was a bit sticky, like it was pre-made and then re-steamed or worse (microwaved?!). But the flavour was delicious!  We had the Euro burger with truffle and goat cheese and arugula and the Gordon burger (which is NOT on the menu) and both were delicious. We also ordered the truffle fries and sweet potato fries. The condiments for both of the fries were the stars of the meal - so delicious!  Overall, yes, it's expensive, but it was worth it, and cheaper than going to buffet. Yes, the wait is a bit long (though we were a party of three and went up to the hostess to leave our phone number, then wandered around miracle mile shops next door, and they text msg'd us 20 mins after we left our name and #, though they quoted us 45 mins wait time). It was worth it!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch/early dinner around 5.  Immediate seating, although finding the place while parked in the Miracle Mile is a miracle in itself.  The restaurant is off one of the main entrances, but a bit of a walk if you park in the shopping center garage.   Cute waitresses and hostesses in skin tight dresses serve the masses of customers.  All are very attentive and responsive, and our drinks were promptly brought to us.  The kids shared a toffee and chocolate shake, wife and I had ice teas.  The shake was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.  Creamy, not overly sweet, bit thick in the beginning, but nice and smooth a few minutes in; kids wrapped it up before our onion ring appetizers even hit the table.    Hellfire burger (wife), farm burger (me), and american burger (split for the kiddos), with some truffle fries for everyone to share.    Hellfire burger was awesome.  Bit of bite in the spice from the pepper, creamy cheese melted over a medium patty.  Wife got it without the bread, so lettuce wrapped with some tomato and onion to help cool the spice from the pepper and aioli.  Great, great burger.  Farm burger.  Duck bacon, fried egg, on a medium patty.  Any time you get a fried egg and bacon on a burger, you have to.  The creamy yolk dripping off the sides and the crisp of the bacon with the meaty chew makes for an explosion of textures in your mouth.  The slight gamey taste to the duck bacon adds a nice touch to the meat flavors.  A+ burger, definitely top of the list.  American burger.  The kids finished this before I could help, but it looked like a normal cheese burger with lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles (which they picked off:)  Kids enjoyed it rather quickly, so either it was really tasty, or I'm good at starving my children. :)  I was not impressed by the buns, though.  Top seemed a little greasy to the touch, and the bottom didn't hold up very well to any of the dippy goodness that was my fried egg.  Didn't seem like they toasted/grilled any part of the bun, as mine became rather soggy quickly - either from the oils on the burger or the yolk, can't tell.  One of the things GR always seems gripe about on his shows are soggy buns...ironic that I'd get some at one of his restaurants.   Truffle fries.  Wow, what is there to say about this.  Dip it in the truffle aioli or the chipotle ketchup, both are winning sauces -- though the truffle aioli is a little thick to keep eating.  Fries were nice and fresh, crispy steak fries with a buttery center.  Parmesan adds a tinge of bitterness to the sweetness that's either the ketchup or the aioli.    Oh, and the onion rings.  Not the best I've had, but whatever ranch mix they used to make the dip, that thing was amazing.  Crispy on the outside, crunchy onions on the inside, makes for an appetizing start to the meal.  All in all, a good experience.  Not the best burger joint in Vegas, nor is it the worst.  Can't say I'd go out of my way to try this place, but you'd be better off here than at Pinks if you're at the Planet Hollywood. :)"}
{"text":"I loved this place! It is absolutely unique from the crazy flame display in front to the varied menu.  It was one of thee hardest decisions of my life deciding what to get because everything sounded so good.  I went with the farm burger and it's basically like a breakfast burger, but the duck bacon has this delicious smoky flavor and the sharp cheddar cheese was a perfect pairing.  The BEST Onion Rings I've ever had, beer battered, huge, and had a great presentation.  I couldn't wait to try the shake when I heard it was half pudding and we got the highly recommended chocolate hazlenut, I had already premeditated ordering that as soon as the waitress asked for our drinks you can believe it didn't last long. My friend tried the hot dog and that was next level! You've probably seen the pictures, but the meat is very high quality - not your typical lips and asses.   I can't wait to  revisit  Burgr and explore the rest of the menu in depth.  I was really debating getting the Truffle fries or the fish and chips, but didn't want to get too bogged down before a wild night on Vegas.  Service was on point, the only problem was lack of stomach space so I could try everything!"}
{"text":"Amazing burger. The place is quite loud but it's a fun spot. I really enjoyed the truffle fries too. Great selection of craft beer"}
{"text":"Really nice place, if you're looking for innovative, high-techi vibe.   I'm a big fan of gr, but I gotta say, the burger wasn't amazing as expected,  similar to the one at the Blt at the mirage.   All in all, long wait, nice atmosphere, ok food."}
{"text":"Great burgers, of course.  It was hard to choose one.  The rest of the menu was unique, I like that.  And the pudding topped milkshakes were amazing, I'd like to know how they put them together.  And huge, nearly a meal in itself with a cookie on top.  Next time I may just go for dessert.  YUM."}
{"text":"The best burger I have had, definitely plan on returning to try another. This place was very nice and the overall service was great. The wait for food was a bit long but that could be because we were starving at the time. I would definitely recommend making a reservation, after we left there was a long line of people waiting."}
{"text":"First let me say I've never Yelped before. I set up a Yelp account just to write this review.  After my experience at Burgr I realized I would have been better served going to In-N-Out Burger. Even that fast food chain has a better product this Burgr and it would have been quicker too.   This may be the most pretentious restaurant I've ever been too. From the stupid window fire pit to the name of the restaurant \"Burgr\". This place is over hyped and not worth a minute waiting in line. If you want to wait for an hour+ to eat a burger with zero flavor, as well as a burger that will cause you to run to CVS for some antacids then have at it. I'll put up with the ignorant hostess , the terrible pushy server with bad attitude, and to be rushed to order so that another party could be seated if the food was good.  Well....... The burgers at \"Burgr\" such a stupid name, I digress, are terrible. I have never eaten a burger with such no flavor in my life. If I could I would scream at Ramsey the way he does at the people on his TV show. This place is a waste of space at Planet Hollywood and your time and money.   Only reason it gets two stars is because of the fries and jalapeño poppers.   The shakes suck too. You'll spill most of it because they over fill and when you move the straw it overflows.   If you want to waste 30 bucks a person put the money on a number at the roulette table instead.   Once the sheep wise up this place will be a distant memory.   Gordon Ramsey should be embarrassed of the product he puts on the plates at this restaurant.   And yes and hour later and my esophagus is still on fire from the burger.."}
{"text":"Their burgers are delicious. Fast service too! My boyfriend and I thought we'd have to wait a long time in the long line, but 30 minutes is pretty average for popular restaurants. We were surprised and pleased by the overall experience."}
{"text":"Waiting was a bit tedious as times continuously extended 15 minutes after coming back the previous 15 minute estimated given time. After finally being seated and being in a grumpy mood from waiting with an empty stomach, our server James changed the whole ball game with his very welcoming introductions and suggested all the great food. My girlfriend and I could have sworn he was the manager of the place serving guests due to his pristine personality that changed our frowns from entrance to a great experience with a happy smile when leaving. Definitely an experience! AMAZING SAUCES!"}
{"text":"Love this place for appetizers and cocktails. . Truffle infused fries. . To die for.  This is my go to place for hang out time with out of towners. ."}
{"text":"Since we enjoy watching Gordon Ramsay's shows on TV, the wife and I decided to try at least one of his restaurants during our stay in Vegas. BurGR happened to be the one since we stumble upon it at PH. We found ourselves being very critical about everything, just the way he is on the shows. We admit that everything was at or above our expectations from the initial greeting to when we walked out the restaurant except for two things, we expected our burgers to be bigger and my wife's burger \"Hell's Kitchen\" was not as delicious as our expectations were. For being a casual Burger place I think is very Pricey, they range from $14 - $16 a piece and it does not include the fries ($8 - $11), along with $4 fountain drinks. Overall we are satisfied with our experience at BurGR but I think we are over it. My guess is that we will be paying a premium just for the name at his other restaurants."}
{"text":"Food was alright, not worth the price however. There is one thing I was very disappointed about; there was only one type of glass for beer. Not every beer goes into the same style of glass, when you put beer in the wrong glass it doesn't taste right. Disregard the fact that I paid more than twice what my beer should have been, I was expecting a proper glass to get a proper taste. Thank you for turning a beer I love into something that I couldn't even finish. Gordon Ramsay should be ashamed that his name is associated with this place"}
{"text":"the wait was about 40 minutes, party of 5 on a Friday night which wasn't that bad. The burgers were so amazing I think it was worth it to spend about $15 per burger. The meat is very fresh and juicy and also then bun was very soft. I liked the onion rings because it had a sweet taste to them. This place is a must-go when coming to vegas!"}
{"text":"This was the second time that went Burgr. The first time was just okay. I went such a long time ago that I don't remember much of anything. This review consists of my visit on Sunday 9/21.   I had a great experience. We arrived at 12pm, and there was no wait. We were seated immediately, and a server came immediately to bring an ipad with cocktails we would be able to order. There were technical difficulties with the ipad, which we didn't mind since we weren't interested in drinking.   We all ordered the farm burger because it looked the best. I didn't like the last burger that I had, while this one tasted delicious. It was a burger with duck bacon and an egg. I asked for mine to be medium, but I felt like it was more medium rare. I'm not much of a steak fan, so I don't prefer the taste of beef/steak so much. The duck bacon and the egg mixed really well, so it was absolutely delicious! The egg was cooked medium, do when I cut my burger, the egg just spilled onto the plate. Sadly, I lost a lot of my yolk, but that's the price I had to pay. :( The duck bacon was thicker than normal bacon, but it was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered Truffle Fries which were much thicker than I expected. I actually don't like the taste of truffle and I don't know why people put it in everything. But, that's just my opinion. They did sprinkle the fries with some sort of cheese which I did like. They make their own dipping sauces- one of which was ketchup and I forgot the other one. The ketchup tasted sweet and reminded me of tomato juice.    The service was spot on. The waitress kept coming over to refill drinks whenever they got low. The waiter brought out our check and when my friend presented her total reward card, he quickly brought her out a new tab.   The only problem I had was the wait for the burgers was super long. It took quite a while for us to get our food. Other than that, great burger and great service."}
{"text":"Great burgers for $15-$20 each.  A little bit of a wait but manageable but the burger quality was incredible.  One of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I had dinner here for the grand opening night. Considering it was the first official day of their opening, service and food was excellent. The waitstaff was friendly and made sure drinks were always full. The burgers themselves are a little smaller than average for a gourmet burger but very delicious. All items are la carte so make sure you order some fries. The truffle parmesan fries are great with their dipping sauces. The highlight of my meal was the strawberry shake with coconut pudding. It's is the most expensive shake I have ordered ($8) but it was also the best shake I have had. The shakes are a must. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Pricy but worth to try, like the hazelnut coffee shake a lot! Ordered medium cooked burger and it was delicious. The fire decoration is one of the high light too, very attractive."}
{"text":"After having some of the best burgers that money can buy i gotta say that this wasn't one of them. Although it is a good burger,  not a great burger. Big ups to the oreo shake though."}
{"text":"By far the best burger we have had in the longest time. We tried the Hell's kitchen burger and it was just perfect. Just the right amount of flavors. Loved it! Truffle fries were also the perfect side for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Fantastic service and great food. We went for lunch and had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and aioli truffle fries and both were wonderful. The colors of the burger toppings were so vibrant it was almost like looking at a work of art. And, oh my goodness, the jalapeño popper appetizers were the best I've ever had! All of the ingredients tasted fresh and this definitely enhanced the overall flavors. We went at lunchtime and only had a 15 minute wait. Not only was the food outstanding but I was impressed by the attentiveness of all the servers. Our drinks never got more than half empty before a new one was places in front of us. We sat at the counter and watched all the food being prepared - definitely recommend this if possible because it's like getting a show with your meal."}
{"text":"Nice place! Even after having two of our six person party's burgers be too rare. The fries were delicious and the service was even better. We got to look at the menu on an iPad which was dedicated to the custom website! I would definitely recommend coming here! (We waited four hours to get our party in!)"}
{"text":"I've tried GR's other more expensive restaurants and quite honestly, I have not been impressed.  I just tried Burgr, going in with very low expectations and glad to report the burger was good!  No, this was not the best burger that I've ever had as honestly, BJ's Brewhouse has a burger that is better and more tasty, but all in all for the price point, this was not bad!  The onion rings were good as well.  For a decent price, we received a decent burger but nothing that I found to be exceptionally great, but wouldn't mind going back either."}
{"text":"We had to wait a little over an hour to be seated but it was well worth the wait. We had a party of 4, so the hostess took our number and called us once our table was ready.   I had the farm burger and the truffle fries. Everything was phenomenal and cooked to perfection. The aioli dipping sauce that came with the fries were a great combination.   I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"So utterly unimpressed. Burgers were dry, overcooked and took forever. When we informed the server how bad our meal was we got a \"sorry\" and that was the end of it. Not a very good first impression. I expected better from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant - even if it is just a burger joint. We won't be back..."}
{"text":"I travel to Las Vegas once per month and have visited over a dozen \"best burger\" establishments.  Tonight was the second visit to Gordon Ramsey's burger place. The occasion I attributed to the location of planet Hollywood, loud and busy. The experience tonight was a repeat of the first visit. I usually sit at the bar to watch a game and tonight did the same. I rate burger joints on my favorite combination, bacon, blue cheese with car Elise do oinions. When one enters this place lower expectations for service. It's basically a chop shop, turn'em and burn'em, feed the massive hoards as quickly as you can. I digress, I ordered the above meal with root beer. Ten minutes later my burger arrived. I ordered the duck bacon as extra measure. I took a couple of bites and viola there it wasn't...  my order. Very medium rare and one thin strip of bacon with a dollop of what appeared to be blue cheese. I waited and waited and waited for the waiter, who to his credit was more interested in the scantily clad waitresses, who can blame him? I was distracted as well. No refills. Finally he shows up and asks if everything is ok. I replied in the negative citing the under cooked burger and lack of quality and most important the sliver of bacon. Our hero's reply was to take off the $3.00 for the duck bacon, as opposed to apologizing and remedying the situation by offering to have another burger prepared. Or inform a manager and he/she can make a decision. Result, I just paid the bill, no tip and left. I realize Gordon is a victim of his own success, but like I said in the beginning of this piece, it's fast food, decently priced. My opinion is the tourists believe the hype and can tell their friends they ate at the world famous.......I prefer, bobbys burger and the  burger place in the shoppes at Mandalay Bay,."}
{"text":"Overall, very good. 5 stars for the jalapeño popper appetizer. 5 stars for the onion rings....6, if possible!  The burger was good, not great. That's the reason for 4 stars. But I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, however the hells kitchen burger I ordered was not as expected. I ordered to go and waited half an hour for my food to arrive. When I bit into the burger it was overly salty, as if the person who was seasoning the meat dropped a whole canister of salt into the patty. It's probably because I ordered around 11:45pm and they close at 12am so they didn't care about the standards and said \"f\" it, they can't complain after we close. So disappointed."}
{"text":"So I am from Chicago and I know good food.  I think Gordon is a pretty arrogant guy on his shows and am not the fondest of him.  My wife wanted to eat here so I agreed.  I will tell you as much as I hate to say it The Hells Kitchen Burger was the best burger I have ever had.  We actually went again on our trip just so I could try it again and it was just as good the second time.  A+ for service also.  The Onion rings were very good also."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We got to sit at the chef's counter which was a lot of fun. We got to watch the whole set up process. The kitchen staff is on their game.   My hubby said it was the best hamburger he's ever had. I had the turkey burger and it was delicious as well.   The truffle fries are amazing and I'd come back just for them."}
{"text":"Yum! I'm so bummed I was too full of burgers, onion rings (make sure you get those) and truffle fries, to taste the shakes! Cutest little waitress, who was top notch! Go! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Burgers were God drinks were good fries were over done the staff was friendly And efficient"}
{"text":"Aside from the 45 minutes wait to be seated on a monday, i'd say our party had a great time. Food was pricey but that was expected going in. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We were told that the wait for this place was about 45 minutes for dinner, we only end up waiting 15 minutes! The burgers were delicious and the service was really good and food came out fast :)   The food was definitely worth the wait! Next time i'm in Vegas, I definitely want to try some of their appetizers too!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, service was awesome. I got the chili dog which had lots of flavor but was waaaay to big for me to finish. My friend got a burger which he liked but I thought was kinda dry and bland. We also got the jalapeño poppers and truffle fries both were delicious, HOWEVER the 2nd popper I had lit my mouth on fire and had me sweating....I could have died!!! I love spicy food but damn I was suffering.  I couldn't even think straight.  The struggle was real people.  Would I order it again? Possibly"}
{"text":"My friends really wanted to check this place out a few weekends ago...I have recently stopped eating red meat and really worried about not being able to find something I could eat.  I figured - when in doubt - there are always fries! :) Boy was I right!  So the bad:  Perhaps they could have another vegetarian option? (Ummm...YEAH! I know! The place is named BURGR!!! LOL!).  :) No, really...I couldn't really find anything bad about my experience here...it would be a hamburger lovers dream!   The good:  Their vegetarian option was awesome!  A delish portabello mushroom burger.  Yummy goodness.  I enjoyed every bite!  I'm guessing some people might not like mushrooms, though.  :) I even took a bite of my friend's burger (Yes! I know it is red meat! I had to see if it was worth getting sick for!).  If I weren't going to be out for the night and if I wanted to deal with an upset tummy - I would've gotten the burger despite swearing off red meat!  It was amazing - flavorful, moist and yummy.  Yes, all that from one bite. My other friend got the soba noodle chicken salad and she enjoyed it.  Now the fries - if you don't do the burger just go for the fries!  I love truffled anything and those fries were AHHHMAAAAZZZINNG!  We ordered one order of truffle fries and one of sweet potato fries and we couldn't even finish them all ( there were 3 of us).  The customer service was great, food came out in a timely manner, and the food was GOOD.   Overall a fun and delish experience!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Thursday early evening and the place was jam packed.  It was just me, so I got seated right away at the counter.  They start the upsell at the beginning by having you look at the expensive drink and dessert menu on a tablet.  Wasn't really able to ply myself with alcohol at that time so I settled on water and ordered the Hells Kitchen signature burger ($15) with a side of Maui onion rings ($9).  It took a long time because they were so so busy.  I literally saw dozens of orders go out before I finally got mine, but it was worth it.  The burger was great tender, juicy inside with nice crispy outside.  The roasted peppers, especially the red, were really tasty.  It was not spicy in a heat scale, but rather flavor oriented spice, which I prefer.  The onion rings were good too.  Crispy, salty, all the way to the last one, which I somehow managed to do.  Pricey, but I would go back."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!!!! I haven't had food this great in a while... I was so not expecting the food to be this amazinggg!! I got the aioli with roasted tomatoes burger, gooey fries and a cookies & cream and creme brûlée shake. Everything so tasting and left me without words."}
{"text":"I had high hopes having been a Gordon Ramsey fan but I must say my impression was mixed.  I visited the Vegas location with clients for lunch and right off the bat the hostess was off-putting enough that my clients were starting their experience upset.    After we were seated, the server was polite, informative, and did an excellent job throughout the lunch service.  we ordered truffle fries, onion rings, an Oreo shake, and three burgers.  The food quality was average at best.  The truffle fries were over salted.  Most of the onion rings were good but there was at least one that I tried in which the batter was not fully cooked.  The burgers were average and the shake was really good.  I am not sure where to go for burgers in Vegas but I would say pass on Burgr."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it a 5 star rating instead of a 4 star rating is it's the best burger in Vegas. I had the duck bacon burger with cheddar cheese and egg on top. Also had the jalapeno poppers. Both tasted unbelievable. The burger was cooked to perfection not to mention the in housed made poppy seed bun. The duck bacon on top was amazing as well and wasn't gamy at all. The jalapeno poppers were not spicy at all except for one. Which you have to pick one and find out which one you got. If your looking for a really good burger in vegas this is it."}
{"text":"Don't bother as this place is a name and nothing else.  Wait on line too long for burgers. Multiple tables inside empty but their seating of guest is too slow and inefficient. If this restaurant was a reality show it would but shut down solely for host greetings and seating.  Prices and food = not worth it.  I have eaten great burgers some expensive and others economical but there is a difference between a great burger and an average burger.  This place serves average burgers. I'd add charge $4 to add avocado to an American.  Seriously? Give me an entire avocado for that not just two slices. I ordered two different burgers, fries and tuna sliders. The tuna sliders was acceptable and best item of the list. The rest of it could be passed on.  Fries specifically were too big so lacked anything characteristic whether crunch or spices.  Also, helps to have regular ketchup and not BBQ sauce.   My waiter disappeared for a bit when requesting confirmation on regular ketchup was served.  Also, dirty silverware and very low seats (who designed the tables/chairs).  Total bill with no beverage was $62 so imagine similar as other known burger joints gets a better result (S.Shack or even some higher end bars).  If you must say you have been there from TV go for it but if you are a burger foodie do yourself a favor and go elsewhere as this was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Food: Euro Burgr- Delish! Though I wish I had ordered it cooked medium vs medium-well.  (I feel the flavor of the meat was muted because of this).  Goat cheese  and arugula is ALWAYS a good idea.  Parmesan truffle fries were SO good! get them!  The atmosphere was on point.  From the service, menus, and even the silverware (yes, the silverware!) we were definitely in for an experience."}
{"text":"One star for the service, 2 stars for the truffle fries (so good), but the farm burger I got was pretty bad and unsatisfactory. I asked for my burger to be well done, but I got it burned.  The bun looks nice, but it was very dry and flavorless, much like the rest of the burger. Honestly would prefer a big mac or an in n out burger compared to theirs. If you're going to buy burgers at this price in Vegas, I recommend going to Holstein's inside the Cosmopolitan. Much tastier!"}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews I thought this would be a good place.  The food was average, service was ok.  Stomach not feeling to good after eating here.  Maybe Gordon Ramsey should do a hells kitchen episode on his own place or at least one thats using his name.  Not worth going to this place.  Maybe try In n Out Burger...much better!"}
{"text":"I had a burger called something with \"hell's kitchen\", it tasted great but was extremely hot/spicy, I had to take out the jalapenos"}
{"text":"We were looking for a delicious cheeseburger that wasn't from a fast food joint or some crazy high end place.  This restaurant is a great choice if you want to split those. They have a really fun tech menu for drinks.  Didn't get any but was cool to see that.   I got the blue cheese burger, my girlfriend got a more standard american cheese, and we split the parmesan fries.  The blue was a bit gamey for my liking but was still very good.  Cooked to my requested medium nicely.  It would have been nice to see the fries more crispy, though, they were tasty.  The standard american cheeseburger was what really stood out.  There's something to be said for excellence in simplicity.  That burger had it. If i could do it again, I would get the standard cheeseburger and try one of their shakes.   P.S.  If Burgr reads these, you should offer a tasting flight for your shakes.  Pick three minis for the price of one - or something along those lines."}
{"text":"The food is just so good.  We had the Farm Burger (which I highly recommend ) and the Hog Burger. The truffle fries comes With yummy dips and the you have to get the jalapeño peppers. I noticed there's no salt and pepper in the table.....hmmm...your food is perfection Gordan Ramsay?"}
{"text":"Had the \"Gordon\" burger and good god was that delicious. Also, service was phenominal...will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Really good drinks. Awesome burgers made to perfection. Very tasty french fries. We waited an hour to get in and upon observing this we noticed there were open tables and the line to get in was crazy ridiculous for apparently no reason at all. I'm sorry but even the best food in the world shouldn't force their patrons to wait more than 15-20 minutes. A world renowned chef should know this. A master chef should be able to predict how popular this place would be and design his restaurant thus accordingly. Such a con to force people to wait and lose money in the casino. One of the menus was tablet based and once again another turn off for patrons. It's not hip or cool. Thank goodness the food was excellent or this place would have got 1 star. Price for the food can be a little better for something as simple as a casino restaurant. I most likely would never eat here again because of the wait, that's like a joke in itself. But I recommend trying it at least once. From the reviews I'm reading apparently everyone had trouble getting into this place. Until Gordon fixes it then I'll assume he doesn't care for the customers valuable time being wasted."}
{"text":"Great quality burgers.We had a burger each  and a sweet potato fries to share which was very filling (and delicious).  Not too expensive for the quality and experience!  Don't let the queue fool you it doesn't take long to get in."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would, the food was undercooked and not good at all and the prices are so overpriced for basically cafeteria food with a celebrity name on it! I'm warning you all beware this is nothing more then a low ball burger joint with a celebrity name across the marquee"}
{"text":"Finger licking good!!!! We got the \"farm burger\" that included the duck bacon, the sliders, stuffed poppers and truffle fries . All were delicious.... The service was great...."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Couldn't wait to check out this place for Restaurant Week. Checked the restaurant hours online (11am-2am on a Saturday) and made the trek to the Strip during NASCAR weekend. Fought the traffic and the crowds just to arrive to a restaurant that was roped off and closed. The hostess was still behind the ropes and informed us that they had \"issues\" today and would not be opening for the day until 6pm. Not impressed when a place is not open during their posted hours.  Will not be returning again."}
{"text":"This place is great! Love the ambiance from both inside and out of the restaurant. We will the had cut fries that came with Chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup. The curry ketchup was out of this world delicious. Our burgers were so flavorful and cooked perfectly. I had the butterscotch pudding and banana shake. O-M-G, this was life changing. I haven't stopped thinking about it since we left Vegas. Come here. It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I would say the burger I tried here was average compared to other burger places I have been to. That being said, the price for what you get is GREAT, especially considering the prices at some places in Vegas, not to mention this is a GR restaurant.  We waited about 30 minutes for a table for two. The jalapeno poppers are great...we didn't realize this but 1 of the 6 they serve has an extra spicy surprise inside... unfortunately I got that surprise and my mouth was on fire for most of dinner! We each got the Hell's Kitchen burger... and warning...the jalapenos are HOTTT! I picked mine out, and the burger was still tasty. The bf ate mine and his and said it was crazy hot but delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the Hells Kitchen Burger and i would have to say pretty damn good burger. I enjoy the whole experience. Nice job Ramsey."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to the pork belly dog, but it was no longer in the menu.  Started with the tangerine screwdriver which was delicious.  I ordered the pork belly buns which were good, but not impressive. I also ordered the hummus which was really good, and would  definitely get it again.  I came back cause I had to get a burger at a burger place. Got the Britannia burger which was  amazing. I also ordered the regular fries which were a little stale and too thick for my taste, and would have tasted better with regular ketchup.  Overall I would come here again."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner before seeing Britney Spears. The burger and salads were fantastic. My only regret is being too full to have dessert. Don't worry Gordon we will be back. Happy Customers :)"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsay. We were very excited to be at his steak house.  There was no seasoning on the steak. I was expecting a batter  steak for $110  We waited for our food for nearly an hour.  Our server, Raquel seems friendly, however, Did not do her job right.  She did not check on us if we needed anything else. My woman needed margarita, but she seems as if she was focusing on new customers rather then the those she was serving ."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to eat in Las Vegas! Burgers shakes and sweet potato fries are all great! We stop there every time we passed through, we recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Ok I was ready for this. Just me being hungry, so took a seat at the bar. Hostess seemed like she really didn't want to be there. Bartender was fast and efficient. Orders the Britannia burger and fries. Asked how I would like it cooked. Medium please. They were busy but meal took 30 minutes to come out. For burgers Tanya seems a bit long. Bartender never indicated it was taking a bit to long. So May that cook time is normal. Burger and toppings were very good , the bun was excellent. But burger came out Medium well.  Over all pretty good, but there are many more choices which I will try next."}
{"text":"Took my family here when they came to visit and they all loved it! It is a little on the pricey side but I guess it comes with the name, we had about a 40 minute wait for our party of 8 which wasn't too bad and they send you a text so you don't have to wait there. The truffle fries were awesome as well as the gourmet burgers. My daughter had a hot dog and it was huge and amazing! Great service as well!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. If this was a food only review it would be 5 stars. But, it's not. First of all I was given a dirty (crusted with food) menu, and a dirty appetizer plate. The staff was great, but there wasn't enough of it. It took our server almost 15 minutes to come great us. When we were done eating it took her 15 minutes (after the busser had cleared our plates) to ask if we needed anything else. We requested the check and it was yet another 20 minutes until we were cashed out. I don't blame the server, she was running. She was working her butt off and was extremely good at her job, but she was doing the job of 3 servers. Understaffing is not acceptable to me in a high turn over, casino restaurant. Uncleanliness is unacceptable in any restaurant. That being said, I will reinforce that the food was perfect."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to get a burger in Las Vegas. Not only are their burgers amazing, but they have the best truffle fries. I hate going to the strip as a local, but I go way out of my way to visit this place. I wish there were more of them!"}
{"text":"Every time we come to Vegas we have to come eat at Burgr. Unfortunately, this time the only thing that was superb was the shake..the fries were too dry and the burgers tasted off. It was a bit disappointing seeing as that the food here is usually amazing, but didn't exceed prior expectations. Hopefully these problems will be fixed so that my family and I will once again have an outstanding dining experience."}
{"text":"This was a really good burger place I found in the Hard Rock Hotel/Casino.  Being a fan of Gordon Ramsey, this was my first time in one of his restaurants.  The atmosphere was distracting (that's Vegas baby!) but the service was top-notch.  The staff was knowledgeable and friendly.  The Fury wings and Hell's Kitchen burger was tasty."}
{"text":"We started with the hot dog which was amazing my wife loved the bread it was toasted and the hot dog was perfect then we all had hamburgers which were amazing cooked to perfection & great flavor we ended with the french fries which were okay A little overcooked next time I will try the onion rings and ask them to crisp the fries.. only thing that we didn't really like was the ranch and the sauces that came with the fries they were okay. A note to all everything is ala carte which means Burger don't come with fries and you pay for what you get it's a upscale restaurant but worth trying."}
{"text":"The Gordon Ramsay Burgr is a well thought out plan. A nice resturant located inside of a casino. The initial waiting time was about and hour and a half, which to our standards was a pretty long time. When we got to the front of the line, we were very excited, and even more so when we were seated. The servers were very nice, and the staff was full. We ordered burgers, obviously, I ordered mine medium well. When the food came, my burger was well done, maybe even a little charred. I was starving, but I didn't really care. The burger itself was delicious, and as usual, I like to put ketchup on it. The ketchup they provided was a odd concoction of chipotle, vinegar, and regular ketchup, watered down. I have many allergies, and after I ate the burger, I felt like I was allergic to the burger some how.   Ambiance- Beautiful  Staff- Awesome  Waiting Time- Horrible Food- Moderate Thank you."}
{"text":"Great food! Our first night in vegas and we decided to try Burgr since we were staying at Planet Hollywood! Wait was a little long but food was amazing! Maybe we were hungry? The Hell's Kitchen burger had the perfect kick and was moist and delicious. My husband tried the Britannia and that was delish too! I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan and was blown away by the food!"}
{"text":"I just visited Vegas to get engaged to my lady, and we went with a bunch of friends whom decided on GR's burGR. This place was fantastic. Our waiter was very informative about the food and specialty drinks. The GR burger was awesome! The portions were perfect and the appetizers, specifically the garlic fries and onion rings were amazing! Definitely check this place out if you're in Vegas, and don't be deterred by the long line out front. The line moves fast and it gives you time to take an awesome photo on front of the flaming logo!"}
{"text":"Husband and I visited on our honeymoon thanks to glowing reviews from our good friends - I loved my burger, my husband wasn't impressed with the Hell's Kitchen. We started with the fried jalapeños (which were 'okay,' not what we were expecting in flavor or quality for the price) I ordered the Euro Burger because I wanted to try something new and being a fan of goat cheese I loved it but it was nothing jaw-dropping. We ordered a side of Parmesan fries and both agreed the flavor was terrible. Great service, ambiance, and the fact I enjoyed my burger give this place it's 3 stars. Would not recommend to a friend and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We were young and wild, there were three of us. The burger was good the bunn supirior and the onion rings were extravaganza. Waited 15 minutes to get a table,  the service was good but we could get the food a little faster. May god be with Gordon ramsushhh."}
{"text":"Burgr is a good spot for a burger when on the strip.  It was quite busy and a tad pricey but I guess you are paying for the Gordon Ramsay name.  Although I would not make a special trip to Planet Hollywood for a burger, if I am near it and craving a burger, I would stop in at Burgr again."}
{"text":"Got here about 10 minutes before open and were second in line. By the time they opened on Saturday morning there were about 20 behind us.  Since we got in so early chef Christina ever so graciously allowed us to get a picture. I ordered the gordon which is not on the menu, ground pork and bacon with avocado, bacon and cheese. My girlfriend got the farm burger. Enough fries to easily split for two.  Gordon burger was phenomenal as was the bite of the farm burger I got which I think has an egg on top.  The waiter asked for how to cook my burger and I responded that I didn't know pork burgers had an option. Regardless both burgers were incredible but I wasn't blown away by the ketchup options, curry ketchup and honey I believe. My brother raved about the ketchup but it's not for me.  Burgers were around $14 to $18.  Great place overall but come early or expect to wait an hour or more.  Also I'd skip the fries at $7 and try the jalepeno poppers instead."}
{"text":"Hamburger was number 1 to me. The hummus I had before was also delicious. Generous portions and good prices. Worthed!"}
{"text":"I really loved Burgr!  The Blue Cheese Burger was very moist and cooked to perfection and The Truffle Fries are to die for!  My wife had a good Mushroom Cheese Burger, but it was lacking in the amount of cheese on it. Service was excellent here as well"}
{"text":"Oh, what a nice experience to go to Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. My boyfriend and I are huge fans and we were so excited just to be there. Food is amazing, fries were delicious (but a little salty), burguer was divine, onion rings too. Service was ok, it looked like they wanted us to dine fast and move on, probably because they had a huge line waiting."}
{"text":"Best burger  I've  ever had!!! Everything was amazing! You have to try the sweet  potato fries- highly recommended! Affordable and tasty!"}
{"text":"Ate hear during a business trip. Staff were exceptionally friendly and engaging with the only exception being the four hostesses, who seemed bothered that I interrupted their playing with each other's hair and gossiping to ask for a table.  I eat paleo, so I always have a lot of special requests--no burn, hold the croutons, etc. All were obliged with grace.  I got no guff for not ordering an alcoholic drink.  The farm burger was delicious, cooked perfectly rare. Caesar salad with kale was very tasty as well. The house iced tea is extremely good.   Tab came to $40 for one person, no boos, which felt a bit high, but it is the strip after all.   Ambiance was a touch frenetic for my tastes. Music was a bit too loud and obnoxious, tables a touch too close. I got bumped by staff several times.   All in all though, good times. I'd go again."}
{"text":"Great burger! I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, cooked perfectly. I also got a side of fries for myself but good enough to share. A little pricy for a burger but what burger place in Vegas isn't?!"}
{"text":"This is strictly a burger restaurant.  They do have some vegetarian choices but I think everything is served on a bun.  There were 4 of us and we each ordered a different burger.  All of us were happy with our choices and the burgers were prepared just how we ordered them.  The only downside was the price.  Granted we each had 1 cocktail or 1 glass of wine but the tab for 4 (with tip) was $170.  That's a lotta lettuce for a burger!"}
{"text":"Waited 40 mins for food. Very overrated for price. I guess u r paying for the name. I have eaten better burgers at In-and-Out and not paid $100 for lunch. I don't mind paying for quality food but since it is a Michelin star chef I would hold him to a higher standard.  Will not b returning here very disappointed.  The only redeeming factor was the waiter was very nice and polite.  Gordon u need to improve ur food quality."}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot to say. This is by far the best burger I've had anywhere in the world (ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger on two separate occasions). To top it off they have great fries, great shakes and a great selection of craft beers.   The only downside is you need to be prepared to wait. I've only been twice so far, both at \"off\" times, and we still had to wait about 45 minutes each time. For future reference, put your name in, then walk around the Miracle Mile shops while you wait. They'll text you when your table is almost ready."}
{"text":"Great burger. Nice and juicy.   I kinda wish I woulda got the regular fries over the truffle fries though. They were good, just a little over seasoned.   I also had the hazelnut pudding shake & it was delicious!!!   A little pricey, but hey it's Vegas, go big or go home."}
{"text":"I'm always on a quest for the perfect burger, so I tried this place.  The Farm Burger was very tasty (bacon, cheese and fried egg).  The meat was tasty, the bun was fluffy and it all came together well.  The parmesan fries were also pretty good.  Great selection of beers and other items.  The only strange part of the meal was the over-eager, over-anxious, \"I'm your best pal\" attitude of the waiter.  I appreciate good, sincere, efficient service....but don't try to blow so much smoke up my shorts!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but I am not willing to give 5 stars due to a couple of things that are easy to fix yet were not. First the Soda was flat as water and instead of bringing me another Soda one with let's just call it fizz, they made me wait over 15 minutes just to say would you rather have lemonade! I thought they were putting in another CO2 bottle. The food arrived hot and fresh! Very tasty and each burger looked like a little masterpiece! My last gripe is it took 20 minutes to get our check, this was after they cleared our table. At the end of the day food was great, service was sub-par Gordon should have been there lighting a fire under their Ass!"}
{"text":"Beware the long line to get into the restaurant that the staff seems to allow premium access to certain folk who walk up and flash some fancy cards from their wallets.   Beware the $13 bottle of wines being sold for $13/glass.  Now onto the food. The truffle fries were the only decent part of the entire meal albeit a little heavy on the Parmesan cheese. Overall, I can't really complain because it was a different twist over a plain fry.  The farm burger came cooked correctly (medium) and my girlfriend ordered the euro burger (medium rare) and it was also cooked correctly. That's where the positives end though. Both burgers were salty to no end. Not sure if it was the bun or some rub on the meat but it wasn't very appealing to the palate. We also felt that we were eating very greasy meat. We decided to skip the desert.   Don't forget to have your picture taken by the professional photographer for a modest fee :)  So, would I come back to this place. Definitely no"}
{"text":"This restaurant was awesome it was totally worth the wait and the walking. I ordered the truffle burger which is one of the expensive things on the menu but it was amazing. It was so amazing that everyone from my family changed their order to that. I also ordered the chicken wings that were awesome and we ordered one after another. The service was nice and happy and over all it was totally worth it and the money."}
{"text":"I walked in guessing this would be a terrific burger, and I wasn't disappointed. Paul, my server, was quick, knowledgable, and kind. He suggested an awesome cocktail (skinny screw) that I had to restrain myself from drinking immediately. Ordered the Blue Burger with arugula- fabulous! It was simple, but every ingredient was fresh and delicious. Perfect amount of blue cheese and I love the buns they use. Great value for the $$."}
{"text":"Pros: Wait went faster than expected. Instead of the 20-30 minutes the host had said it only took about 15 min.   The jalapeño poppers were OKAY. But you have to have a high tolerance for spicy because they are VERY HOT!!!   Service was good. Out waiter was attentive.   Cons: I had ordered the American burger and my friend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. Both had NO flavor. We both ordered our burgers medium but they came out medium rare, my bottom bun was soggy with blood by the time it got to me. We also ordered the truffle fries, which we couldn't even really taste the truffle oil, and they were soggy.   WE WERE BOTH EXTREMELY SICK AFTER DINNER THAT NIGHT. I will not go into detail, but we are still suffering even the next day.   Overall: we spent $74 on 2 drinks, 2 burgers, 1 appetizer, and fries. We could have gone to In n Out and spent $10 on a better meal. Don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"What can i say food amazing and service amazing as well honestly best burger I've had. Farm burger is the top one i recommend the pork bao buns delicious as well gordon Ramsey is doing it well"}
{"text":"The most delicious burger I have ever eaten. I highly recommend the truffle fries as well. I had heard so much hype about this spot and was definitely not disappointed. The wait was about 25 mins. but worth it. The flavors literally gush into your mouth with each bite. Each ingredient in the burger has its own flavor; but when blended together, it's a masterpiece. Very tasty and delicious burgers, fries and appetizers. But of course...the lead chef is a previous winner on Top Chef!"}
{"text":"My family and I were on vacation and decided to stop by here since we were walking The Strip. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and I didn't know how to feel about it. It just tasted ordinary. I honestly had high expectations for the burger, but there was just something lacking. HOWEVER, the dessert was amazing! It was an Oreo Shake with Creme Brulee pudding. I'm all for trying restaurants at least twice, and maybe the next time I'll try a different burger. Dessert is a no brainer :)  PROS: - The server that had our table was friendly and was patient to answer any questions about the menu.  - The Oreo Shake with Creme Brulee Pudding!  CONS: - The wait can be long, and there were no seats for customers to sit on. It was busy, and we waited about 30mins (It didn't help that the Superbowl playoffs were playing live at that time). - The burger just seemed ordinary. - Bottled water cost $7"}
{"text":"great tasty Hell's Kitchen burger with some fire from the roasted-just-right jalapeño....and the onion rings were equal to it...well battered and delicious.  And a TON of them.  Couldn't finish  Packed at noon on a Sunday but if you ask the host stand nicely they'll let you grab a seat at the outermost section of the bar.    I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pricey but well worth it. Get a seat where you can watch the kitchen staff. They were always cleaning up behind themselves and this made the meal that much better. We will go back just to watch and learn and oh yes......to eat."}
{"text":"I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan and so naturally I wanted to try this place out.A bit expensive for a burger but it was very good food and service was great.I think the Kale salad is a rip though. I ordered the Euro Burger,Onion rings and we shared the creme brulee oreo shake. food was yummy but pricey."}
{"text":"The burgers are good and I would suggest trying the truffle fries.  There are a few things that could use improvement: 1. The attire is in my option inappropriate for the food service industry as the dress hit right under the girls butt cheeks, let me tell you none of the girls would be able to bend over without showing you a full moon. I get that it is Vegas but a inch or two longer would still meet with Brittney Spears approval. 2. Service and friendliness was lacking in our experience. We were never asked how the food was, never asked if we would like water and had to wait thirty minutes for our food. 3. About twenty minutes to get in and about thirty minutes for food after you order that's long when you are hungry so plan ahead for that.  I was not impressed enough to go back."}
{"text":"You are just paying for the name. I'm sorry. There really isn't anything too special about BurGR, everything is overpriced, and I do not recommend BurGR to anyone. Don't get me wrong, I love a burger as much as the next person, but there really wasn't anything too extraordinary. I don't know if its because I have been a culinary arts major and I understand the marketing aspect of the restaurant, but its definitely a place where you are just paying for \"Gordon Ramsay\" name.  The Customer Service is great, the ambiance is great, the interior design is flawless. Its just the prices that are not favorable.  This is definitely a one-time place."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Planet Hollywood resort so decided to try this restaurant despite its affiliation with Gordon Ramsay (don't like his screaming made-for-tv personality.) The wait staff was very polite although I don't see the need for the too small dresses.  My Blue Burger was tasty but slightly overcooked. My friend's American Burger was greatly overcooked...he asked for medium and there wasn't a hint of pink in there. The \"Just Fries\" were tasty but we didn't like the Chipotle or Curry ketchups.  To wrap-up my feelings, if you're going to only serve hamburgers, then you absolutely positively better be able to serve them as requested whether it is Medium or Well Done."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay is a awesome place, I loved the vibe, and the American burger was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible management!!! I have never ran into such bad service. Jennifer \"the manager\" was not willing to help out in any way. She was very rude and unaccommodating also lied about some table being reserved when their rule is no reservations what so ever."}
{"text":"Food was great. Joanne, manager, apologized & said she would comp a 2nd beer, but guess what? 2nd beer on our tab! Yes indeedy. Stay away if you are the very least bit \"red neck,\" as they just don't like you  but they like your $$$. Compliments to the chefs only."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try even just one of Gordon Ramsay's establishments, and this was our first location.  The food was MUCH more than we ever expected. Even for just a \"burger restaurant\".  We began with the five spice chicken sliders. The breaking was crunchy and the meat was juicy at the same time. The sriracha mayo gave it a slight kick that was just right.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was spicy yet calming at the same time due to the jalapeño and avocado pairing.  My boyfriend ordered the Farm burger which was also amazing. The duck bacon is not crispy like pork bacon but instead, it's much more flavorful. The egg mixing with both the bacon and cheese gave it such an enjoyable combination.  We shared the \"just fries\" and they were nice and hot and seasoned well.  Lastly we ordered the shake#4 for desert. The Oreo shake at the bottom was nice, creamy, and thick. Everything you look for in a shake. The crème burúlée pudding at the top.. There's just no words for it.  The waiter we had was very polite and attentive. As well as the bus boy. Continuously checking on us and cleaning away any unnecessary plates.  Overall it was an experience that words cannot justify.  We will definitely be back again. I recommend the food here with no questions or doubts."}
{"text":"It opens at 11am by the time we arrived at 11:40 it was full, a line and 45 minute wait. They took our cell # and name down and basically, you could walk around to kill time while a table makes itself available. And then they will text you. I had the house burger that came with a fried egg and duck bacon. I could do without the duck bacon. It's just gamey, but it wasn't overpowering that it killed the burger. Truffle fries are THE best, just a hint of the truffle. Onions beer battered curry ketchup , delicious and the jalapeño poppers are awesome. We didn't get dessert on this round we were too full. The sides are portioned well enough that 2 persons can, share but if you want to be a fat ass one for yourself is good enough. This would have been a 5 star rating but the service it could have been way better the girl could have checked on us. We had to search for her for refills or napkins. Remember tip is optional and for exceptional service. That's all."}
{"text":"Tried BURGR for the first time last night. Arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday night, and was greeted with quite a line out the door. There was a 30 minute wait for a party of 2. Parties of 3, or more were given the privilege of putting their name in at the front and then getting a text when their table was ready. We inched along to the front if the line, and then were finally seated.   Hubby and I ordered a couple of draft beers. I chose the La Fin du Monde, which I compared to the chai tea of beers. I liked it! The Hubs went for Miller Lite. We skipped the appetizers, and ordered a Farm Burger, med rare, for him - and a Hell's Kitchen Burger, med rare, for me. Completed the order with some truffle parm fries. We loved everything! My Hell's Kitchen Burger was really good, had a little bit of jalapeño spice in the middle. Literally had to stop myself from gorging on the truffle fries. They were thick cut, aromatic - in other words, heavenly. We skipped out on the sticky toffee pudding push pops, and the shakes. We were stuffed! Saving those for next time - there will definitely be a next time."}
{"text":"The food was amazing in presentation and taste!!! So worth the wait . Loved the text you when your table is ready feature. The added plus is the Mgr Benji who made our experience memorable . I will be back again and I'm bring friends ! One of the highlights of our trip. To bad Ramsey wasn't around or the experience would have been perfect .. Thank you again for great service Benji  The two girls on sat night :)"}
{"text":"Was honestly the most amazing burger i ever had. the bun was light fresh and tasty the burger was perfectly medium the toppings were great...I had the Hells Kitchen burger with rosted jalapenos & oven roasted tomatoes and a nice slice of avocado! The truffle Parmesan fries were amazing with the mushroom aioli sauce and ketchup. Along with a nice tall blue moon beer perfectly chilled! And the girl from his show Hells Kitchen (the winner) winner was there busting her butt for sure (forgive me I don't know her name)"}
{"text":"Our waitress Ginger was amazing. She was patient with our large group and accommodated our needs. She stayed friendly despite the stress. The banana butterscotch milkshake was surprisingly yummy."}
{"text":"If you love burgers, skip this place. This place has great appetizers and shakes. Not so much the burgers....  We are so disappointed by the experience we had. My euro burger was average. My fiance's burger came completely well done even though we ordered medium. The meat was stiff and there's no pink whatsoever.   If this is just another burger joint, we wouldn't complain. But this is Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. He's very strict about how food should be. How in the world do you make this noob mistake? Plus, the server didn't even give us any discounts or anything. She just made us wait an extra ten minutes for a new burger which was cut in half. Not worth the premium.  This is a heavy blow to his reputation."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Monday evening, and waited for 15 minutes to be seated even with a platinum Total Rewards card. No worries, they can text you when a table is ready for you, which is very convenient and nice! We were seated and immediately greeted by our wonderful server, Mia. She was so helpful and nice, and gave great suggestions! I ordered the Farm Burger, and our table also split the Parmesan Truffle Fries and Onion Rings, all recommendations from her. They were all AMAZING. All of the sauces that came with the sides were amazing. My boyfriend, who hates ketchup and ranch, was scraping the bottom of the sauce bowls for the cheddar ranch and chipotle ketchup. We had the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops for dessert. I had high hopes as sticky toffee pudding is one of my favorite desserts. The presentation was unique and great, and the salted peanuts ice cream made the perfect combination of sweet and salty. Altogether, for 4 people, two sides, and two desserts came to $96. Not bad for Vegas! I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The wait was long but worth it. I recommend getting the HOG BURGER...mother of all orgasmic mouth watering food. Server was awesome! Gave us the menu promptly and took our order in the next 10 minutes. Good service, bomb ass food"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place. I had a lot of friends recommend me here and I didn't get a chance to go for the longest time.  Now I'm mad I waited so long!  Not the cheapest place but the quality is definitely there."}
{"text":"This place has been on my \"To Try List\" for a while. I tried it with my friends last summer. In my opinion, the restaurant is overhyped because it is Gordon Ramsay. The wait time was long, but this was expected. The burger was amazing though. The texture and the taste were on point to my liking. The sizing of the burger looks quite small, but it is filling (varies between people). The price is expensive for a burger, but I don't mind trying new expensive restaurants every once in a while. The fries, onion rings, and the service was good. Our waitress gave us free samplers of a beer, Leinenkugel, was very good. It tastes like fruity pepples. I would recommend this to try. Since in Vegas, there are a lot of restaurants to try. You are expected to spend anywhere from 15-30+ dollars per person here, but of course, it depends on what you order."}
{"text":"I guess I had high expectations coming to a GR joint. Here's my simple take:  Not a bad initial wait time - 20 minutes on a Thursday night for a table of 3 Cool waiter. No frills thrills. Got the job done. Said he would give me the Total Rewards discount even though I didn't have my card. Nice! Food took close to 30 minutes to come out. A little longer than usual.  Here's where they lost me: bottom line, the Uber Cheeseburger was dry and luke warm. Seemed like it was sitting under the lamp for a good 10 minutes. Probably why the food took so long. There was no juiciness, the cheese had already melted. It was a bland BurGR. No comparison to Bachi Burger. I thought GR would've out done Bachi but not even close.  I might try it again another time. Maybe today was an anomaly. I like GR. But this was a letdown. 3 stars, but could be 2 if not for the good service."}
{"text":"Food here is very mediocre... Not good, not bad. Had a spicy margarita which was pretty good, but the burgers and fries were eh. Super long line to get in which I didn't really understand because I don't think I'd go back. Too many other food options in Vegas! Try somewhere else. Sorry Gordon. :/"}
{"text":"First of all I love burgers and I love boutique burgers. So on my latest 3 day burger tour of Vegas this was my first stop.  There's good and bad about this place, but one thing is for sure - it's somewhat overrated and and definitely overhyped.  First, the service and the vibe are kind of lame. Very tourist trap vibe and very \"Vegasey\". I had the Farm burger and truffle fries. The fries were not cooked well and I didn't enjoy them at all. The burger patty was perfectly formed and beautifully cooked. The problem is that it's not all that flavorful...underseasoned, no good flame or smokey flavor. If it was better seasoned it would have been great. The bun is nothing to write home about. The egg was perfectly done. The bacon was decent.  No condiments made the burger a bit dry, so I used the aioli and ketchup from my fries. The ketchup is \"meh\" and really shouldn't be messed with. The aioli was good.  Lastly, the various burger concoctions on the menu leave something to be desired and are not al that imaginative. \"Euro burger\"???? Ever had a burger in Europe? Blech. Not only did I not have to make a tough decision, but there wasn't even one that jumped out at me as being \"OMG I have to have that\".  So Burgr's burger is not a bad burger by any stretch, but for the money there are lots better burgers available. If you are a burger connoisseur then, really, skip this place and go to either:  1) Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay   or  2) Holsteins Shakes and Buns @ the Cosmopolitan.  Both offer far more satisfying burgers that were memorable, different, and deliciously satisfying. Leave Burgr to the less experienced, the more easily amused and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went to Gordon Ramsay BurGR last week while in Vegas because my wife and I are fans of Mr. Ramsay and thought this was definitely one of the cheaper Gordon Ramsay options.  We went around 1130 and didn't have to wait.  The atmosphere was AWESOME.  Our server immediately came to the table and took our drink order.  After coming back to the table the server brought an IPAD to the table which serves as the drink, dessert menu which was a pretty nice touch.    I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and my wife had the American Burger.  The fries are not included so we ordered the fries as a side.  Our food came fast and was presented nicely on the plate.  My burger was definitely the BEST I have ever had and the fries were hot and crispy but not greasy!    I wouldn't pay $37 at home for two burgers and an order of fries but on vacation why not!  Gordon Ramsay fan or not the place is AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers tasted fresh and had a lot of flavor! The sweet potato fries were also amazing because they came with powdered vanilla! The shake was also very good. Literally one dessert on top of the other. I got the creme brûlée and Oreo shake and the creme brûlée even had crusted top! The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the staff. I really don't understand why the females wear short, tight dresses for the same job that the males do (guys wore a dress shirt/tshirt with jeans). Whatever, not like I had to stare at them or anything . Oh wait, I basically did! The waitress that was serving us and a few other tables around us constantly kept bending over or sticking her ass SOO close to our table (pretty much on) and to my food. It became very uncomfortable. One minute I'm eating and the next I'm afraid her ass is going to pop out onto my food. Idk why she chose to stand in the small gap between our table and the next. This happened at least 5-7 times. I really didn't need a view/reminder of where the meal will eventually end up going through. She seemed nice but really should be mindful of customer space."}
{"text":"Really delicious burgers....shared a Hell's kitchen burger & Uber Cheese burger...both awesome.  Friend complained Turkey burger was salty.  Should have other appetizers that aren't fried, but overall, I had a great meal for a celebrity chef's \"B\" restaurants."}
{"text":"Waiting for 40 mins in line and another 40mins for burger. Please go to in&out. It is much better than here, more juicy and taste. If you want a luxe burger, come to Los Angeles. There are many restaurants have wonderful burgers. Poor services and poor food"}
{"text":"I debated between 3 and 4 stars on this place but decided to go with 3. Was recommended by a co worker who visits Vegas frequently. I have to say its one of the better burgers I've had but not sure if it was worth the price - off the strip I'm sure this place would be more reasonably priced for the food. As with most other Yelpers I had Hells Kitchen but I like spicy food. Also in part because a few of the menu options had an item I either didn't care for (mango chutney) or was unsure about (figgy onion jam). Also for a price of $8-11 their fries could have been better (maybe try fresh not frozen).  I also have to side with those who said they got a table fairly quickly but the food took longer than expected. My girlfriend and I were seated in about 20 minutes and drinks were out within 5. But waited over 30 minutes for 2 burger and truffle fries.  3 stars for a good burger, good drink menu and friendly/knowledgable staff.   Will get an additional 2 stars once the fries improve along with the wait time for the price of food. If I'm going to pay $17 for a burger by itself, 15 minutes should be the max. wait time, not 30 +."}
{"text":"Quite simply, the food at Burgr was absolutely amazing and I would even say that this was by far one of the best burgers I have ever had.  We had the Britannia burger, and the mango chutney it it was a great taste pleaser.  The garlic fries are also a fantastic side, and enough fries for 2 to share.  The atmosphere was quite pleasant, although the 35 minute wait to get in was frustrating.  It would be nice if they accepted reservations or gave the ability to book on open table.   Now here is my negative why I took a star away.  The girls at the front desk could have not been more disinterested in their job if they tried.  When we went up to ask how long of a wait, it seemed like we were doing nothing but bother their petty little discussion.   Not cool.  As for the waitress, she took quite a while to get our order, someone else brought it out, which I was appreciative of as I didn't want to wait all day, and lastly, once we were done, no waitress to be seen.  A bus boy cleaned our plates up and when I finally asked the hostess for our waitress to bring our bill, the manager ended up bringing it to us.  This didn't seem right.  In short, go for the burgers as they are absolutely unreal, but flip a coin if you will get decent service or not.  Just don't be in a rush when you go!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a few Ramsay restaurants and Burgr doesn't disappoint. Is the line long? You bet- and for good reason. Glad we didn't have to wait at all in line. There's a way to not have to wait, but I'll let everyone complaining about the line figure it out on their own. Meanwhile, we'll skip the line while those with self-appointed 'foodie degrees' give this place a poor rating simply because they don't know the simple way to avoid said line.  The Earth Burger is delicious. Yes, it's vegetarian. The truffle parmesan fries are amazing and the 'Skinny Screw' cocktail tastes like Kool-Aid. Four of those with dinner and I was ready to party all night!  The banana, snickerdoodle, butterscotch shake.... WOW!  Perfect wait staff, fast service. Spot on. Love how your bill comes accompanied by an iPhone with a survey to rate your experience. Nice to see someone cares.  Overall- I'd highly recommend this place. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I encouraged a couple of my mates to join me for Restaurant Week, and we decided to come here. We were told that there's a 30-minute wait, which turned out to be an hour. It was a little frustrating. The place's design concept is interesting, not in a sense that is negative, but definitely different from any other burger spots I've been to. Attention to detail was definitely not spared, from the tables down to the waiters'/waitresses's and hostesses uniforms. The iPad that had the beer, spirits and dessert menu was also a nice feature. The price is fair, and since we were there for Restaurant Week, it was quite amazing! We paid $20 for a burger, an appetizer (any of the fries or onion rings) and a dessert. In addition, I also tried the pork belly bun. Our waiter was pleasant and our water was never half empty (it's one of the things I keep a tab of).  The Food: I got the Euro burger, the pork belly bun, truffle Parmesan fries and the push-pop. The Euro burger, although the description was mouth-watering, it did not step up to the plate. The cheese was too over powering and I could hardly taste anything else but the cheese. The pork belly bun - it was loaded with carrot strings, the taste was good but you may need to remove some of the carrot strings. The fries was a bit too salty for me but the sauces were pretty darn tasty! So I would suggest, get the regular fries and just ask if you can have all of the sauces (there are 6 I believe). My friend got the onion rings and they were pretty good. The batter was light and was incredibly crunchy, however, the ones in the bottom, it's best to skip those since they are so greasy. The dessert was pretty neat experience, a sticky toffee/peanut butter ice cream push-pop. It's been a while since I've had a push-pop myself. The peanut butter ice cream was okay, but the sticky toffee pudding was pretty tasty!   I'm rating this a 3 start instead of 4 because of the food. I felt I had to alter my food in order to enjoy it. Service/ambiance is a solid 4 (not a 5 since our wait time was double what was told to us)."}
{"text":"WARNING we got food poisoning from BurGR (and no we weren't drinking).  Two out of the three of us got food poisoning while the third who ate the pork burger was fine.  I had the Euro burger with truffle fries and I'm not sure if the goat cheese was bad or it is was something in the aioli, but having a whole day of your vacation ruined because someone isn't doing their job was horrible!  It was coming out both ends for 8 hours.  After my system purged BurGR I was fine for my last day of vacation.  I reported the incident, but Planet Hollywood employees never responded (even though when I called twice they said someone would call me) and were actually quite rude.  So needless to say Planet Hollywood just lost 3 customers for life."}
{"text":"Bad! My husband and I were so excited to try BurGR! The only positives were the atmosphere and we thought the bus boy had fantastic service (unfortunately he helped us at the end of our dinner). We ordered wings to start. We did not care for the wasabi favored ones but thought the spicy ones were great. Our burgers were both undercooked. My husband ordered medium and I ordered medium well. Mine was all pink and my husband's was bloody. We were in a rush to head to a show (we were told an hour and 15 min wait and it was over an hour and half) so we didn't catch anyone to send our burgers back. The waitress didn't come back for 10-15 minutes to check on us. When she did come back she didn't ask us how our burgers were. She seemed very busy and just asked if we wanted another drink. The burgers were very salty for me and my husband's taste.  We were really frustrated with the hostesses. We were told about an hour and 15 minutes and that they would send us a text when our table was ready. After an hour and 15 we hadn't received a text yet so we went to check to see how much longer it would be. The hostesses were all very nice but they told us that they needed to bus some tables and it would be a \"few minutes\". So after about 10 minutes they told us the same thing and after another 10 minutes we were seated. A \"few minutes\" to me is 5-10. I guess a few minutes to them is 20. Then when we sat down there were several open tables (about 8). I'm sure these were tables that they were waiting for people to come back after getting a text that their tables were ready but they seemed to be open for awhile."}
{"text":"Went there early and got in the line. Waited about 45 minutes and were told by a staff member could just leave and come back in 30 mins to a ready table. They took our details and we left the line. We returned after 30mins and was told by staff that we just had to go to the back of the line again (which was now double in length). I explained the situation over and over but there was no budge. We were starving, so left and ate elsewhere.   Really disappointed by the staff.  Wouldn't recommend even trying."}
{"text":"I watched a bunch of Gordon Ramsay TV shows and finally got to try his BurGR restaurant out. I came in with HIGH expectations and every one of them were met. Whether or not you are a Ramsay fan, this place is a must try for the best service and burgers.  Wait: Yes, there will always be a line. Each time I walked by at all hours of operations, I saw a line. My visit was on a Saturday for lunch. 10:45am Saturday = no line. 11am (opening) = 30 people in line. Since we were the first group to enter, line died down really fast. However, expect a line if you go during any main meal times.  Service:  After being seated, we were presented with an IPad for the drink menu. Very easy to navigate and modern. Our server(s) (they apparently have a \"backup\" server as well) were all attentive and friendly. Great service.  Timing: If you watch Hell's Kitchen or Master Chef, you know Ramsay is all about timing and putting out delicious food without making the guests wait. I have to say, the timing of the drinks to appetizer to entree was perfect.   Food: Since it was my first time, had to order the Hell's Kitchen burger -Medium Well. Let tell you.. from the top bun to the bottom, pure perfection. The buns were super soft yet maintained it's form from the crisp outside, the bottom bun was not soggy, and all the ingredients worked really well. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had.  Jalapeno Poppers - what a clever way to present it. Not that having a main dipping bowl to dip your poppers is hard work but the individual shot glasses containing sauce and the popper makes it... easier and more enjoyable. Hands down, the freshest jalapeno poppers I've had.   Fries with Truffle oil. If you are dining with someone else, 2 burgers and one order of fries is plenty for both. I saw some people order a side of fries per person and none of them left finishing the fries off. What can I say... fries.. truffle oil.. yum yum yum.  Great service, great food, VERY reasonable price (TR members get $1 off each item), this is definitely a must try if you are on the strip.  GO GO GO GO GO!"}
{"text":"Great food, don't expect it fast though.  I sat at the bar, the 2 bartenders were friendly enough.  Had the American and truffle fries.  Perfect medium burger, couldn't finish the fries, as much as I wanted to!  Great selection of draught beer, and a couple of ciders!  All in all, I will go back, whenever I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"BEST BURGER EVER! i had the hells kitchen burger and me and my friend shared the truffle tries. it was amazing. so juicy and delicious....  go, run!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate friends birthday. Good ambience. The service was great.    We tried the farm burger, Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle fries, regular fries, and jalapeño poppers. The burger was good, wasn't dry.  Fries were average. The poppers was delicious, crunchy with a kick of spicy. Probably would not come back because of the 1 1/2 hours wait."}
{"text":"Meh...  I was in the mood for a good burger for lunch and was torn between trying something new and going back to BLT Burger.  Needless to say I should have gone where I new it was going to be good.  The reviews on this place were good and there was no line.  I sat at the bar and had a Pale Ale.  They do have a decent tap selection.  I ordered the signature Hell's Kitchen Burger.  It doesn't come with a side so I ordered Truffle Parmesan Fries to go with it for an extra 11 bucks.  I was a little surprised at how small the menu was.  A burger restaurant and there were only 7 hamburger choices and no build your own option.  The burger looked beautiful when it came out.  The bun is very appealing and is probably the best part of the meal.  I expected bold flavors from the roasted jalapeños, and asadero cheese but it was just an average burger.  The beef didn't come through at all and the patty was fairly thin.  The fries were pretty good but it was the dipping sauces that made them.  The house made ketchup was good but the truffle aioli sauce was excellent.  It wasn't like it was a terrible meal, I just think it lacked bold flavors I would expect from a renowned chef's restaurant.  It would have been a good $17 dollar meal.  For $42, (tip included) I left unsatisfied.  **Why do the Burgr reps only reply to the 5 star reviews? That tells me a lot. They don't seem to be too worried about making improvements or taking the customer reviews seriously."}
{"text":"Good ingredients, yummy burgers, fries and milkshakes!!  This place gets an extra star for being friendly to diners that share a single burger.  I'm a petite girl, I can't always finish a full meal so I like sharing with a friend.  :) Thanks for a grrrrreat service!!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this because we love burgers and shakes.  They had two waiting lines, one line for 2 people and another line for 3 or more, and the wait for 2 was about 30 minutes for us at 7pm on a Wednesday.  The ambiance was a nice casual atmosphere, dark so it wasn't great for pictures but definitely set a nice mood.  They have a tablet that they give you to browse and order alcoholic beverages and a paper menu with their food offerings.  We ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger and the Farm Burger which was two of the burgers they seem to be known for in the reviews on Yelp, a side of onion rings, and the creme brulee and oreo shake (Shake #4).  The burgers were delicious and the beef was done just right.  They gave us a choice on how we wanted our burger cooked and after requesting them as medium they had just the right amount of pink.  The jalapeños in the Hells Kitchen burger weren't all that spicy if you're looking for a burger with a kick.  The duck breast bacon in the Farm burger was an interesting twist and the Farm burger is great if you want a meaty protein filled burger.  The onion rings came with a side of bbq sauce and chive ranch sauce and was more than enough for two to share.  The shake came in a fancy tall glass layered with the oreo shake on the bottom, creme brulee layer on top, and topped with an oreo cookie.  They seemed to be very busy but our server was still nice and attentive enough and was able to refill our water at least twice while asking us how everything was.  Although they weren't the best burgers we've ever had as compared to a few places in NYC, overall it was a great visit and we would definitely come back to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"I'll give it 3 stars for the food and service which was good. However, I have never seen a restaurant so mismanaged. The teenager hostesses are just not capable of handling this restaurant and the crowds. When you have to stand in line for what seems like forever, and when you finally get in, I noticed at least 15 tables that were empty. I almost took pictures. They were set and ready to go but remained empty. Now, for someone that just stood in line for over 40 minutes, this is totally unacceptable. Eventually some got filled, but people left, tables were cleared, and again sat empty. I thought, well, maybe there isn't a line anymore. Wrong! When we walked out there were people standing in line. My husband did talk to the 20 something manager, who just nodded.   No doubt this will be my last visit to this restaurant. There are much better places in Vegas than this. No excuse for this. Hire a manager that knows how to manage a restaurant! This isn't high school."}
{"text":"The food and table service was outstanding. I wouldn't expect anything different. However, the hostesses were extremely condescending and rude. They are the first interaction customers have to deal with, so as someone who also works in the hospitality industry, I'd highly recommend working on basic manners."}
{"text":"We ate here on Friday 10/9 for dinner. Took about 20 minutes to be seated. Ordered an American burger and the hog burger. The wait for food was longer than expected. Manager came over to apologize for the wait and gave us a generous discount on our meal. Burgers came out shortly after and oh were they written the wait!! My American burger was so tender and flavorful and my husband said his hog burger is the best he's ever eaten! Definitely lives up to the ramsey reputation!"}
{"text":"My wife was at an optometry conference in Vegas and I decided to tag along. I had heard about the milkshakes with pudding on top so decided to go here on Thursday afternoon for lunch. I sat at the bar and, when presented with the shake menu, decided to wait until a time when I could share a shake with my wife (they are huge). I ended up getting the All American Burger and it was fantastic! On Friday afternoon I decided to go back to get one of the Milkshakes since my wife was going to be done with classes early. I was also looking for a smokeless place to watch my beloved Pittsburgh Penguins Stanley Cup playoff game. I asked the crew at the bar if they could get the game on the TV for me and they were very accommodating, so I sat down for lunch again and ordered a Fish Sandwich plate. It was even better than the burger I had the day before. Moving along to the Coffee milkshake with chocolate pudding. Huge and delicious!! Hugely delicious. It is also worth mentioning that the bartenders/waitstaff were very friendly and helpful in a mellow at.  The meals were a tad overpriced but no more so than anywhere else in the highly overpriced Sin City. Go here for lunch or Dinner if you have a chance."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my dinner experience here during a work convention. Asked to be seated in the back for a less noisy and uninterrupted atmosphere (since the front of the restaurant is open, didn't want to get bothered by many other convention goers/colleagues)  Made a reservation with the hostess the night before without any issues. Service was good and prompt.  Food was appropriately priced (for Vegas) and quality of food was very good. Plenty of beers on tap for any taste.  Table ordered: Fried Chicken Sandwich, Chop Salad, Fish and Chips, Vegetarian Dish, Steak.  Only one that was a bit lacking (and typically is at most restaurant) was the vegetarian dish. Seasonal grilled veggies with a grain of some sort. Slightly overpriced for what you get. Understandably this happens at a lot of restaurants but one would hope it would be an equally satisfying meal for our vegetarian coworker.  Would recommend for an easy dinner or drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"Visiting a Gordon Ramsey restaurant was to be a highlight of our Vegas trip for my teen, who enjoys his Master Chef shows.  We so wanted to like this restaurant...but it wasn't to be.  We thought the decor and iPad menus were neat, but the tight server uniforms rode up on the waitresses thighs to the point I worried we were going to see more than intended.  We started with the Truffle Fries, which were tough and tasted stale. Instead of being golden brown and crisp, they were pale and appeared to have been sitting a long time between frying.  When offered a replacement, we switched to the Maui Onion Rings and they truly were fabulous.  The worst part of the experience though was the burgers.  We ordered one Farm Burger and one Chanterelle Mushroom Burger, both well done.  Both came, sans any sauce, and severely under done...very pink inside. You would think a restaurant specializing in burgers is very experienced in cooking them to the customers desired done ness (otherwise why ask \"how would you like that cooked?\").  We sent those back as well, and told the waitress to not rush, we'd rather have them done than fast.  When our replacement burgers arrived, one was fine but the other was pink on one side.  When it was returned as well (with no offer of selecting a different entree), we were so disappointed.  My teen ate her Farm Burger and just as we were ready to request the check (and go find another option for lunch for me since I was now starving), the on duty manager approached and comp't our meal.  This was nice (and the right thing to do), but I would have greatly preferred to speak to him much earlier and actually eat something for lunch, so having him not appear until that point was actually the coffin nail that labeled our experience an \"epic fail\"."}
{"text":"I was excited to try it out... Got seated,  ordered, got drink, wait 10 min then 20 min... No waiter and no one even looking my way.  People next to me seated way after me and already eating...put down $5 for my beer and walked out.... Figured why bother if they cant get the simplest things right... Dont waste your time... Beef is beef.. Go somewhere where they actually make the effort to care...thanks for ruining the one thing i had planned for myself... Lame"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying that it was my first time going , I will definitely come back once I visit Las Vegas again the food is so delicious the onion rings are so good and the wings too the burgers are really good my husband had the fish and crisps sandwich he loved it and jerry was such a wonderful waiter , great customer service !"}
{"text":"This was our second visit. Food is good but it's not worth the long wait and slow service. Our order was taken and 10 mins later our server came back and had to take our order again. Drinks didn't come out correctly but this was taken care of quickly. Our food took at least 30 mins to come out and when it did it was cold...never again. Never again will I wait for cold food and bad service."}
{"text":"Wait was about 20 mins to be seated, but waited about 35 to receive my food. I ordered the uber burger, and it's so tasty. It has three different thick layers of cheese, which just melted perfectly on top of the burger. It came on some sort of sesame bun? It was a veery fresh soft bun which I loved. The truffle fries were to die for, they come with topped with Parmesan cheese, with a side of melted truffle cheese as a dip for the fries. Was way to full for dessert, as the burger patty is very thick and very filling. Neither my bf nor I could finish our burger. The dessert menu looked incredible! Over all great food, good service (although they could come around a little more often). It was $60 for two burgers, one truffle fry, and two drinks, but I'd say it was well worth it. Superb quality burgers! Not you're everyday burger"}
{"text":"Had to try this spot on our last trip to Vegas. The wait was about 25 minutes around 3:00 on a Friday. Once seated, the service was good. We started with wings which were great. Each of us had a different burger and they were all fantastic. The quality is in the meat, you can taste it. The truffle fries were so good, love steak fries. I will tell my friends to try it when they are visiting but I probably wouldn't go back- too many other great choices in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of fine dining and am used the formalities required to craft that experience but BurGR actually felt disrespectful.  If you're a couple, you must stand in a line. They don't accept reservations.  You can't put your name on a list and go sit down in the adjacent hotel seating, you are forced to stand until they can seat you. (Cheeseburgers!!!) I hesitate to assume the line is intentional but once seated, it was clear that the hostesses were unconcerned with seating the many available tables.   Red-ropes and lines? BurGR felt like a burger shack masquerading as the city's hot new nightclub. But this is Vegas where there are literally dozens of famous and lesser-known culinary gems that deserve our attention. I know GR is world-class chef but why should anyone forgo all that Vegas has to offer to spend the afternoon waiting for the privilege of eating a (albeit interesting) hamburger?   We got two Hell's Kitchen burgers (served alone with no side) the pork belly buns, a milk shake and a coke and spent $58 before tip.   Yes, the burger was VERY good (and I think myself a tough critic) but it was still a burger.  BurGR isn't reinventing the burger, it's improving on it. We saw out waitress twice but luckily the bussing staff was on their game.  I don't mind paying top dollar for a special experience but take my time or my money, not both."}
{"text":"Ate here with my husband for the first time today for lunch. Husband and I agree it was a 5! Gregg was our server today - he was nice friendly and gave is great suggestions. We had the jalapeño poppers - spicy and tasty! I had the farm burger - juicy and cooked just right. I was so full after and so glad I got that one. Husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger - a spicy delight. He lets try his - it was also super good. I got a shake as well. The chocolate and Carmel shake. It's very sweet and filling. My he chocolate is like a malt and the Carmel is a true flavor to the candy taste. I was stuffed after the burger and shake and had no room left in my belly! Really glad we came here for lunch! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner here Friday night. We waited for about 30 mins and thank goodness it was worth every min. U have to try the Farm Burger. It won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Normally I don't write a review but I thought I should share my experience here....  First of all we waited approximately 40 minutes to get our food. That is ridiculous. Second the burgers were not cooked as we requested. We requested medium rare to the rare side but what we received was medium well to well done side.  Third I ordered the honey pig bao buns, which taste really good and I do recommend this but one of the buns had piece if a hair inside. The restaurant did change the item with new one and the manager person came by to apologize and removed it off my tap. That I really appreciate because not that many places have manager to come out to apologize. Fourth we ordered the truffle fries and they forgot to bring the truffle aioli sauce.  Now about the food.  The burgers my group ordered was ok... Not as great as we expected.  The truffle fries seemed no difference with regular fries.  The onion ring was the best!!!! I would be rating with a single star but for the taste of onion ring  and the honey pig bao buns I added another star.      Next time if I come here I probably prefer not to sit at the table but instead sit at the bar and order my onion ring and the honey pig bao buns!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and despite the crowd, we were seated quickly.  Prices are reasonable and service was great.  Would go again when we come back into town"}
{"text":"Great burgers!  My kids favorite restaurant in Vegas! Service is excellent although the wait is long to get a table for 4 but still worth it! Thank you Gordon Ramsey for opening a great place for us regular folks who appreciate good  american food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. I had a Hell's Kitchen Burger and the chocolate tart for desert. Both tasted absolutely amazing. Our waitress Katherine was also very attentive and friendly. My wife and I will be coming back on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"great place and great food  but my wife's veggie Gordon Burger special was sent with bacon in it and had to send back. The mushrooms were thick and bland. Don't order veggie unless you like mushrooms."}
{"text":"Great ambiance! Loved the decor and setting. Food was very good. The ala carte prices, for sides, were way too high ($8 for a small fry and $4 for a soda). Burgers were good. My daughter had the hot dog (no kids menu so they rip you off by making your little one order a full meal).  Overall... Loved it. This was our second time here."}
{"text":"I never review but, thought it was important because we are members of the International Food and Wine Society. We love great food, great wine and great chefs. Last Sat. we went to BurGR and my husband and I could not believe they served our wine in a cheap casino wine glass. When we told the waitress she informed us they didn't have any clean glasses at the time. My burger was dry and too much bun. My husband's was delicious and so where the fries. Mr. Ramsay should make sure his staff has plenty of wine glasses for those wine lovers. Personally I should have keep my reservation at Julian Serrano Restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best burger that I have ever eaten. No condiments needed...the burger speaks for itself. What else can I say. The burger has been elevated to a whole new level. Good job Gordon Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Had a Hells kitchen burger for 19 dollars and expected way better.  The onion rings were 9 and  were very greasy.  The insulting part though was trying to purchase Gordon's cook book for sale for a gift.  The price for the book was $25.00 retail price on the  inside cover.  When i went to purchase it they told me  it will be $48, almost twice as much as list price. This sort of blatant price gouging is infuriating and  will insure we don't go to any other Gordon Ramsey restaurants and support this type of business practice. We ordered the same cook book on Amazon for $20."}
{"text":"This review is from a vegetarian perspective.    Snacks menu: we ordered the onion rings, gooey fries, and truffle parmesan fries - they were all good!  Salad: had the kale caesar's salad and that was good too!  Service: Excellent! Attentive and nice; this may not be the norm, but we didn't even have to ask for refills and they will have it for you already; that was appreciated, but please note this may not be expected always"}
{"text":"Good chicken burgers and a huge amount of fries. We ordered the truffle fries and the sweet potato fries for two people. Way too much but delicious. We ordered the wings as an appetizer and they had an awkward flavor. I advise avoid apps and stick to the grs"}
{"text":"Well I can't really say anything seeing as I wasn't able to get in. I know they do not take reservations and it is walk in only. I tried calling to see what the wait time would be and nobody answered the phone. I was transferred to hotel concierge who wasn't able to get ahold of anyone either. So far not a good impression. I'll try again another time"}
{"text":"Hells kitchen burgerband a chocolate pudding shake.    Kick ass. Impressed.   Luv Ramsay"}
{"text":"My husband loves burgers so of course we had to try this place out. The food is amazing!!!! My husband had the American burger and we shared a huge side of fries. The service was ok. Our server gave us our ticket and to go boxes and he never came back to the table. The manager was walking around asking if everything was ok and I have him our money for the food. Other than that it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Fun place to go, but a little pricey.  I guess that's to be expected though.  I got the Earth Burger and shared fries, which was plenty of food.  You have to pay extra if you want fries or another side--the burgers don't come with fries like at most restaurants.    We went on a Thursday about 6pm, and there were already about 20 people waiting in line.  The line seemed to move fairly quickly though, but be prepared to stall for time.  Conveniently, there is Gordon Ramsey merchandise to peruse as you're waiting in line.  :)  We tried the sweet potatoes fries, and they were different, kind of like a funnel cake, but really good.  They came with powdered sugar on them, so hence the comparison to a funnel cake.  No ketchup here in this place either--I was afraid to ask for any to put on my fries for fear that Gordon Ramsey himself would storm out from the kitchen and start screaming at me (like he probably is ever there!), so I settled for the sauce that came with it."}
{"text":"We walked in and were seated within 5 min. The waitress was friendly and helpful. Our burger was excellent!  Added some steak fries. The fries had Parmesan, it was a first and we really liked them. Of course, it was a little pricey for a burger joint but it was good though!   Oh, there was a bit of wait time for the food to get to the table."}
{"text":"High quality food with a big name behind it but not a big price. I highly recommend that you order a Hell's Kitchen burger with shake #4. The truffle fries are also exceptional with the dips. There is a short to no line if you go at 11 right when lunch service starts. But, if you want to see Hell's Kitchen winner Christina, you have to wait until dinner service. The atmosphere is a little noisy but well decorated. The servers are also friendly and are glad to help you."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers and fries in Vegas! A must if you are navigating through planet Hollywood. I had the Britannia burger which was awesome!! Mates got classic burgers, which were incredible. Onion rings were sensational. Milk shakes were to die for! So delicious. Overall, great food with polished, courteous staff."}
{"text":"If you want to beat the rush for Saturday lunch and not wait in line, come before 11:30 am.  We had a party of 7 and was seated immediately.  However, we did receive a wrong burger.  Make sure to double check the burger you get.  Not only did we get a wrong burger, we also got a bad tasting burger.  The duck burger we got had overcook bacon.  Overcooked meaning pitch black bacon that looked like charcoal. Isn't there some quality control?????  In all, just double check your burger prior from chowing down."}
{"text":"So so close to a 5 for me! The burgers were amazing, the onion rings and Parmesan truffle fries are just what people are saying! Service was good... Salad came after the burger and fries and beer (peroni on tap!) was delivered after the burger was done. Would I come here again? Yes! But there are so many places to try to find that 5 star!!"}
{"text":"Love the food, atmosphere, and staff! Everyone was super nice and accommodating! Would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night at around 9:30 PM. Because I went solo, I was seated promptly at the bar overlooking the kitchen.  I was pretty excited to sit there because I like the TV show Hell's Kitchen, but without all the drama and screaming, watching the kitchen work was fairly tame.  Parties of 2 apparently wait along the flame sign and can end up waiting for a while.  I ordered the Farm Burger and the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  It took a little bit of time, 20-30 minutes, to get food but I guess other people would order appetizers that would come out sooner.  The service was pretty attentive, refilling drinks and helpful.  Farm Burger - Well-seasoned meat. It came with a fried egg done over-easy so that when the yolk is bitten into or squished too hard, as it was in my case, then the rest of the yolk oozes out over the rest of the burger.  The duck bacon was really tasty as well.  The bun is toasted but I don't think the bun in of itself was anything noteworthy.  Overall, a pretty good burger, but it's sort of pricey.  Truffle Parmesan Fries - A little salty.  It comes with a truffle aioli dipping sauce that was pretty garlicky but fairly heavy as well as a homemade ketchup sauce that was also pretty good.  The ketchup can be overpowering and can cover up the taste of the parmesan and the fries themselves.  The fries themselves are the thick cut kind and pretty good by themselves but they can be over-salted.  Overall, I would come back for the burgers even if they seem a bit pricey."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever being to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. I ordered the American burger with a fried egg on top. Really delicious, and man is it a huge burger. Add to that, we had the fries with the dipping sauces. Those were a great change to the normal ketchup dipping on the side of your plate. Its a great environment, has a great assortment of beer on tap, nice assortment of cocktails, lowish noise level depending where you sit, and overall good service. Manager comes by frequently to check on you, low wait times depending on the time of day, and waitresses/waiters are kind and engaging. Will return soon to Burgr."}
{"text":"BEST burgers I've ever had. Jalapeño poppers are a must, so delicious with just enough heat/spice to warm you up, but still allow all the cheesy, creamy, peppery flavor to come through. Gooey fries are also delicious, but beware, one order is enough of a side dish for 4-6 people if you get apps and burgers.   The restaurant is decorated very modern and edgy, very much in GR style. Hostesses and waitstaff all extremely attentive and knowledgable about the menu, the restaurant, etc. We came to try some of Gordon's dishes and left satisfied beyond expectations (well, stuffed to the gills, actually)."}
{"text":"We must have had a really \"off\" experience, based on other reviews. Food: Ordered pork bao buns, onion rings, farm burger, and euro burger minus cheese. Buns and onion rings were both somewhat bland. Pork belly on bao buns was charred/tough. Ordered burgers medium well and sent them back after they came out rare. When prepared a second time, my husband's was very well done (charred). Mine was made with cheese and had to be sent back a second time. Neither burger had an outstanding flavor profile, we mostly tasted the char-grilled, black outsides of our burgers. Service: The manager is outstanding. He was very professional and comped our drinks to make up for the mishap with the burgers. Our waitress and another male staff member who assisted were also extremely friendly and apologetic.  5 stars for service, 1 star for food= 2 overall.  If you want a GREAT burger that is moist and flavorful, try Guy Fieri's new place at the Quad!"}
{"text":"Über cheeseburger was amazing!  Service was ok, and the prices weren't bad.  Looking forward to going back to try the shakes!"}
{"text":"Cute place! Delicious hells kitchen burger, super fresh and yummy hummus.."}
{"text":"Great BurGR,great apps, wings were killer...had shake too,very good...exellent service... it's a lot of hype,but worth trying once...so many burger option now on the strip...you won't be sorry. Overall-Good Pull"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers!!! Jalapeño poppers are must!!! Fresh ingredients, great customer service!! I'm happy I was able to visit this place!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch on a Thursday.  The fire feature in front of the restaurant is eye catching and attracts many photo seeking tourists.    My first impression was of the uniforms that the employees have to wear.  The uniforms do not compliment the staff and are too tight on the girls.  They looked like bad Halloween costumes  we also noticed that they use the same rag / towel to clean the seat cushions as they do on the tables.  Seemed a little strange to use the same towel for both...  Our waitress was a very nice Australian girl who did an outstanding job (Name?).  We asked for our fries to come out first as the Burgers we were told take 20-25 minutes.  The fries did come out but before our water was served.. We went for the regular fries and were very disappointed.  They were not flavorful and not crispy enough.  You can get the same frozen fries at Costco unfortunately.  Next arrives the shake.  It was a creme brulee custard with oreo shake..OUTSTANDING!  Best shake ive had in a while.  The Burgers were also exceptional but mine came plain with no accompaniments or garnishes (maybe i didn't read the menu thoroughly) .  I ordered the Uber Cheese burgr and it didn't disappoint.   The other people in my party had the chicken burgers and they loved them as well.  We had to wait a while to get the check and had to flag staff down to request it.  For a place that seemed to be on a wait they should make this process more efficient in order to turn the tables faster.    Throughout the experience you will see a lot of different staff come to the table as they all have a specific job it seems...It would of been nicer to have the main waitress deliver most of the items except the food as it takes away the personal touch.  The burgers and her were the best part of the experience i just wish we saw more of her :)"}
{"text":"Literally the best burger I have ever had and I have tried a lot. The restaurant is beautiful with streaming flames that dress the windows.  You could sit at a regular table or at s high seat table. To top is off they also have the best sweet potatoe fires.  To add a sweet zing they sprinkle them with powdered sugar. From now on whenever in Vegas a stop at Gordons Burgr is mandatory !!!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for burgr since it is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and I love burgers. Service was great, I had a party of 9 and they sat us right away which I thought was amazing.   Waiter was very descriptive and encouraged us to try the HOG burger. More than half of us did..... And more then half of us got sick later that night   Coming home some of us check our bank statements to tally up our weekend come to find out that 2 of us had been double charged on our accounts from burgr.   If you like great service, food poisoning, and incorrect charging of the bill I recommend \"burgr\"        Tangent: I hate to write a bad review but it practically ruined our Las Vegas trip. we all got sick, tried to figure out the cause and that was the only place we ate at. And to add salt on the wound over charged."}
{"text":"we visited this place for the 1st time.  I can only say that we thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  The burgers were the best we have ever tasted.  I ordered the Britannia Burger and others in my part ordered the American.  We also ordered onion rings and the parmesan fries.  They all were the best we have had anywhere.  The service was great as the waiters and waitresses were energetic, personable and very attentive.  This is a great stop for an enjoyable dinner.  I strongly recommend it !!!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of GR I told my boyfriend we had to go to one of his restaurants before we left Las Vegas. This was a good choice because it was delish. I ordered the chicken \"yardhouse\" burger and my boyfriend ordered the four cheese burger. They were cooked to perfection, dripping that lovely meat juice. We started with the jalapeno poppers, which were probably the best I've ever had. One is loaded with the seeds still in, luckily my boyfriend got that one. They come in the best ranch cheddar dip (we ordered extra to dip our fries in). We also ordered a side order of plain fries, they were the only let down of the meal, they seemed kind of raw still, lacking salt. Overall, the meal was pretty good, 4 stars for the undercooked fries and the price, kind of hefty for burgers and jalapeno poppers + 1 alcoholic drink $75."}
{"text":"Excellent place. Was there for lunch on a Sunday.  Had the Farm burger with a glass of Pinot Noir and Sweet potato fries. Excellent! The waiter was ok, not great, but the food was very very good."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way... From the friendly knowledgeable good looking staff to the wonderful delicious food.. I don't understand any ratings less than 5 stars... \"The wait was to long\" really?? it's Vegas there are a lot of people there.... That's your complaint??... Then \"the prices were a little high\"... hello... you're paying for great quality food and in my opinion it wasn't high at all... Overall experience was great... I am sure to make this a place to eat EVERY TIME I'm in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Waited over 40min which we had no problem with...ordered our food..got both mine and my husbands burgers medium well and they come out bright pink in the middle just like a medium rare..sent it back and waited even longer..they come back with our burgers supposedly cooked more towards the well side..I take a bite and they are more pink than before..needless to say we are not happy and did not give them a 3rd chance to fix it..granted the manager comped our burgers but argued with us in the process... we still left hungry..didn't expect our burgers to practically still be alive when we got them"}
{"text":"We started of with the jalapeno poppers and those were really spicy due to the sauce containing chili oil, the pepper itself was not spicy but man that dipping sauce was spicy. We had the Hog burger and the Chanterelle burger and both were pretty dry.  They needed to add a little more of their sauce to them and maybe they would have been great. We also had an order of truffle fries and those were really good. For dessert we had the push pops (salty and sweet).  I think I enjoyed dessert the most.  Service was good but I was expecting the burgers to be better."}
{"text":"Best food I ate while in Las Vegas. Price is very reasonable too. One of the best burgers i've had. Free refills on drinks is always great too. Staff were very helpful. Top notch"}
{"text":"First time coming here for their burger since name of the place is BURGR...I got the American Burger and it was delicious. We got sat pretty fast by the hostess and our server came by fast to take our order.  Also got the Truffle Parmesan Fries and definitely enjoyed it :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé, his parents and our 3 year old went here today around 3:30pm.  There was hardly any wait. Our waitress (Katelyn) was awesome! We all ordered tap water (not because we're cheap, because we like water) and surprisingly weren't charged for it! The parents each got the Euro burger, I got the Hell's Kitchen and my fiancé got the three cheese burger. All were delicious! We ordered the regular fries and the parm truffle ones. Couldn't get enough!! So freakin good. We will be back during our week long stay!"}
{"text":"Best burger and dining experience I have had for this category of dining.   Great people working here first of all, prompt and attentive service.  It shows that everyone was knowledgeable and experienced. ..even down to the eye contact.  Food was hands down amazing.  Homemade sauces, bread, and fresh ingredients never disappoint.  I went with 4 others so we tried an array of items.  My Gordon Ramsay burger was a new, off the menu item that has only been available for 3 days...so I had to get it.  It was a hog (pork patty) full of flavor, cooked medium with a charred crust, toasted buns with white and black sesame seeds.  And the lettuce mix has chives in it...so thoughtful.    Overall, get the hog burger or pork patty burger...it is just more tasty.  Truffle fries and onion rings were delicious too.  This is the only BurGR location,  so come here when you are in Vegas!  Come when they first open, less wait time."}
{"text":"Came here cause we are in Vegas and people talk about this place a lot.  I have to say the burger is good but not excellent. Nothing to die for.  The restaurant decoration is cool and the staff has nice outfits.  They are also friendly.  Other than that, I have to say the food didn't stand out.  I am a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great meal!  Everything in Vegas is expensive, and all the dishes are huge, so my wife and I almost always split our meals.  No problem here, and everything was very tasty, unusual flavors that work, and fresh ingredients.  We started with the kale granny apple Caesar salad, which thankfully was mostly romaine, with just the right amount of kale.  The apples were sliced really thin, crisp, and a great addition to the flavors.  We ordered the special Gordon Burgr and gooey fries. Everything in the burger was great, but the duck bacon was flavorful and lean - a real standout.  The gooey fries lived up to its name, and yes the egg is done easy, so you can get the liquid yolk all over everything!    Even splitting everything, we had a lot of gooey fries left over, which fried up nicely the next morning for breakfast potatoes.  Great, fresh take on classic favorites!"}
{"text":"Although I can not really say much different about this place just yet, I will give it one more star since the manager reached out to me and offered to correct the experience I had. Next time I am in Vegas I will have to give this place a second try.  Thank you management for caring, it goes a long way"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Hell's Kitchen, so of course we had to hit up Gordon Ramsay Burger. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger...and it was perfect! The jalapeño on it wasn't overly spicy and the meat was cooked to perfection. Totally worth the $15 price tag."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! Came here with some colleagues, we were impressed by the juicy meat and the flavour combinations of the burgers. Also had some jalapenos as a starter which were nice, but not too spicy. If you like it a bit more you will be disappointed. The chicken wings were also excellent, juicy meat with a slightly spicy sauce to give it a the right kick. The only disappointment were the fries, a bit saggy. Some might like this, not our taste though.   Also an excellent beer list! More then 10 on tap and a wide selection, a few lighter American, some European imports and a couple really nice craft beers, including three excellent IPAs.  We didn't reserve and on this busy night (it was CES) we had to wait for about 30 min, which seemed allright. Service was good."}
{"text":"So, there's this guy, Gordon Ramsay, who has a couple restaurants here in Las Vegas. I have no idea who he is, but the marketing for the restaurants, based entirely on name recognition, makes me feel like I'm supposed to. And they're expensive restaurants, so I never tried them.  But now he's got a burger joint at Planet Hollywood, and hell, I'm always down for a burger, so I gave it a try.  First I asked the hostess if I could take one of the free seats at the bar. No, she said, you'll need to stand on line. What restaurant have you ever been to that makes you wait on line for a seat at the bar? Also, there was a line, at 9pm on a school night.  It didn't take long, though, and soon I had my burger. It was average. About as good a burger as you'd expect to get on the Strip, but no better. The parmesan truffle fries were nothing to write home about, either. At inflated Strip prices, once you factor in a beer and the tip, you're paying forty bucks, which is a bit high even for the Strip. And it was nothing special. Just a competent burger.  This does not make me any more eager to try one of Mr. Ramsay's $100+ steak dinners. I guess you're supposed to be a fan of his, and be glad just to be in his restaurant. I've only heard of him on billboards and restaurant signs in town, and I was not overly impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent food and above and beyond service. Lauren our waitress was VERY accommodating and made our visit extremely pleasant. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"overrated... but decent and worth trying once..  nothing special to come back for, especially the fries which were dry and cold, even after i asked them to replace them."}
{"text":"Åt en Hell's Kitchen Burger, köttet var perfekt bra ren kött smak, fick medium stekt som jag bad om. Men osten som var var snudd på kall, om det hade vart möjligt att ge halv poäng hade den fått 3,5."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately it did not deliver. As we walked up to the hostess booth, there were three girls chatting it up and when we approached them they looked like we were interrupting their conversation. The seating is all very low for some reason, so if you are tall and have long legs, it feels a bit awkward sitting in the short chairs.   THE FOOD: I ordered the vegetarian burger with no meat, and it was no better than any other \"burger\" I've had with just a portabello in place of a patty. The fries were also not worth $8, as they were no different from the fries anywhere else other than the unusual curry and chipotle ketchups.  Overall, I do not think the food or experience was worth how overpriced it was."}
{"text":"Menu items are big and al a carte, which can make it a bit more expensive than it may seem at first when you first look at the menu. Taste-wise it's very good."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is ripe with great burger places.  I've tried a few and BurGR is the best.  Great food and comparable service.  I had the 'Farm Burger' and Truffle Parm fries.  Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"Saw Ramsey's face on Planet Hollywood and decided to give it a shot.  Service was outstanding, sat us at the bar overlooking the kitchen.  Our server was super attentive,and polite.  Beer was good, burger and fries were better, see you next time we are in Vegas Gordon."}
{"text":"The only burger on here that is worth the 5 star is the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  I know the Farm burger get a lot of raves and gave it a try once and was disappointed and was wishing I had gone for the Hell's Kitchen. Since then on every single visit to Vegas one of my meals is the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  Appetizers: The wings are decent as well for appetizers if you are sharing. However, I have had better truffle fries elsewhere and would not order these here again."}
{"text":"Great California wine selection for whites! Burger was excellent, prepared medium rare, as requested. Must try! Came here for lunch and had no wait. We tried the night before for dinner and there was a line and a 40 minute wait ( on a Wednesday night). Great service! Will come back next trip!"}
{"text":"WAY OVERRATED. My wife was bugging me to try the hamburger - I finally gave in. If not for all the add ons, like cheese , sauces , onions etc. - it would have been even more bland than it was. We were both disappointed.  Certainly not worth $19! Fries were good, but they don't make up for a very mediocre burger. This place is a fraud."}
{"text":"Wings were ok. Jalapeno tequila lime were good, but not spicy. Spicy garlic wings just had garlic on one wing."}
{"text":"Thought we would give it a try before going to a Cirque show. We thought our kids should enjoy there \"night\" out in Vegas. Of course the flames on the outside draw you in as they are really cool. The wait was about 40 minutes but knew that going in. My 7 year old son ordered the hot dog, by far the best damn hot dog ever even for $11. I know this cuz he couldn't eat it all so I did. The other 5 of us had various burgers and the chicken sliders all of which were good but nothing out of this world. We had all 3 types of fries with the sweet potato fries being our favorite. All in all $150 for 6 to eat was really spendy but we were there for the name and the experience. Not disappointed not blown away. Only complaint...what is wrong with just regular ketchup?"}
{"text":"I think Gordon Ramsey needs to practice what he preaches. I love his shows where he is always complaining about the food being too cold or raw. I had lunch at about 1:30 pm.    I had the damnation chicken burger which was served slightly above room temperature. It taste fine but there was no heat to the burger that boasted jalapino as a main ingredient. I did not see a jalapino anywhere. It was cooked through and served on a plate with no garnish just an empty plate. I also got the chocolate and carmel milkshake. This was served just above room temperature. Not cold like a good shake. It also had the caramel as a layer on top of the chocolate. I had to stir the shake to combine the caramel into the chocolate and since it was filled so high it spilled over the edge down the side and onto the table. I had to get someone to clean up the mess. I also got the sweet potato fries. They were also served just above room temp. Covered in powdered sugar with a dipping sauce that was like weak lemon curd it was more of a dessert that fries. The fries were cooked well but I could only eat about one-fourth of the order. (It was a huge amount of fries that could easily feed two or three people.) I was so over taken by the sugar on the fries that I had to stop eating them as I was starting to not feel well. By the time I left I was not well at all. I started having an upset stomach and really bad gas as well as feeling like I had motion sickness. This continued all night and I felt so bad I could not eat anything  for the rest of the night. That was last night This morning I feel better but bloated. I was not impressed with the food though I really wanted to be impressed. The decor is nice and the staff is young and sexy. I guess Gordon is selling sex appeal to make up for the food. The music was bit loud so people had to talk louder to be heard which made for a very loud lunch. They had wide screen tv sets to watch so I watched all the fast food commercials. I spent $40 with tax and tip for lunch. I have had meals at Red Robbin and Subways that I have enjoyed more. Go by the place and take pictures of the fire wall but pass the meal and get something cheaper at the food court."}
{"text":"The farm burger was so good. My friend also had the euro burger which was also good. The strawberry shake was to die for.  The services was also good.  Overall everything was excellent. I will go back soon."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I ever had. Even with no pink the burger was juicy. The Parmesan truffle fries were literally the best and I've had my share. Lots of parmesan and truffle oil they just explode with flavor. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"How horrible is this, we make reservations while we are in the casino at 5 o'clock it is now 730 and we  are still waiting to be called. We were told the wait would be 20 minutes. What incompetent staff. I definitely expected so much more.  So I have two stars because of the wait time we got last time but after the amazing food we received I'm changing the stars to 5. It truly was 5star food.  Maybe they were overloaded or they were understaffed that day and we were just extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Bon service, cher pour un burger et vraiment sans plus! Dans un pays ou l'hamburger est roi, celui-ci a vraiment l'air ridicule. Nous ne parlons vraiment pas de haute cuisine! Mayonnaise aux truffes délicieuse."}
{"text":"The food was okay the service was phenomenal. Burger was a little on the dry side maybe it was because I asked for it medium well.   I did not taste the onion jam.   Their ketchups were really creative and good."}
{"text":"This burger is the best I've tasted by far.The fries is so good.I had the American burger it was so good!It was so good I wanted another one after I was done."}
{"text":"Went here on our \"chef ramsay tour\" in vegas and were not disappointed.    We had the porkbelly as the starter, enough for 2. The flavors were amazing.  For the burgers we had the farm burger which has fried egg and duck bacon!  Delicious.   They are very generous with the portion of fries.  We ordered three orders for three people and had a big amount left over. Our favorite were the sweet potato fries.   For dessert we had the sticky pudding push pops, they were ok. They had plenty of ice cream and little pudding.   My only complaint about this place are the hostess girls. They're more worried about giving every girl that walks by looks from head to toe and making comments to each other, rather than helping customers.  We waited in line, then realized we were supposed to check in first.  There were at least 3 other parties that did the same because we didn't know how the check in/line worked."}
{"text":"Expected to be blown away.  I was satisfied, but ultimately underwhelmed.  The food tasted like a decent burger at any respectable restaurant.  The fries were pretty good.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good, but a bit of a reality check. With a name like Gordon Ramsey I really expected a lot more.  Food was good but no where near the hype. Honest, I think I make a better burger and I'm not a chef.  That being said,  the experience was pleasant and the staff was nice. Again the food was not bad, just not as amazing as I be as hoping for."}
{"text":"All I can say is incredible delicious burger.  Like eating a wonderful chopped juicy steak.  Great flavors."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place because I love burgers. My girlfriend and I showed up at 1 pm on a Saturday. We had to wait 25 minutes to sit at the bar which wasn't too bad. The waitress recommended that I order the Gordon burger which was a fan favorite. I got that and the girlfriend got some mushroom burger. The burgers and truffle fries came out and I would have rated it 4 stars but the wait to get the food was pretty long. In addition to getting a seat, we probably waited an additional 25 minutes for the food to come out. After I scarfed it down, I got the check and saw that the Gordon burger was $19. No wonder it was recommended and not put on the menu. It was $5 more than the original burger I was going to order. Food was good but overhyped due to his tv show."}
{"text":"I had high expectations, especially if it was burger from Gordon Ramsay, and... it was that, and more. It met and exceeded all my expectations, the meat was so juicy (Hell's Kitchen Burger) shake #4 was so delicious. I had such a wonderful time eating and enjoying every bite."}
{"text":"Thee best burger I've had in my life! It was delicious the wait was not to bad around 30 min. The hostess was not friendly at all she was a stuck up and rude. But the rest of our experience was great. 5 stars for both the food and the waiters ."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good aside from the fact that they ignored our food allergy requests. Had two people allergic to peanuts at our table - I ordered a salad that came with peanut dressing, and told them we had allergies at our table and asked them to substitute a different dressing. Instead they brought the salad covered in peanuts, and the peanut dressing. Accidentally tasted the dressing thinking it was the substitute dressing I had asked for - Other places in Vegas were so considerate and even printed 'peanut allergy' on our ticket to alert the kitchen of a severe allergy. This place acted like they had never seen a peanut allergy."}
{"text":"BurGR was the first meal we had in Las Vegas. We needed to wait in the line for 20 minutes which already mentioned by hosstess when we first entered the queue. I believe this is reasonable for a busy Saturday night. I ordered Hell's Kitchen burger and my wife ordered Soba Salad also we ordered one classic fries to share. For me burger was really good. It was the best i have eaten during my US trip so far ( i still have NY to go :) ) however my wife said soba was average ( she also experienced same dish in Japan so i am going to take her words for this ). Fries was pretty good and ketchups served with it was delicious, i loved them. We paid 50 bucks for this menu, it seems a little overpriced but it is still reasonable when you consider the name of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Came for the burgers and the pretty boys.  Was not disappointed.   (Fish and crisp sandwich was absolutely excellent and service was great)"}
{"text":"Gotta say, Gordon Ramsey brings the goods here.  The burgers (and the whole experience) are top-notch all the way around.  By far, the best meal I had at the Planet Hollywood resort & casino; and best burgers anywhere in Vegas (where there is a staggering amount of gourmet burger competition).    My group visited twice in two days (because our reports of the first experience were so transcendent that our friends had to see for themselves); first time we tried the Farm Burger and the Brittania (which the server mentioned was Gordon's choice last time he was in the restaurant); second time, we got Hell's Kitchen burgers; every one was exquisite.  Delightfully cooked, and featuring flavors that just simply work so very well together.  One friend had a salad, and that was exceptional too.  Side note:  the hummus appetizer is a real treat.  I'm guessing one wouldn't figure to go for the hummus in a burger place, but it is delicious as well."}
{"text":"The most overpriced food I've ever had in my life.  Gordon Ramsay I guess is just one of those faux celebrity chefs who acts like he knows what he's doing but just rehashes already known ideas. The menu was extremely uninventive using cliche terms and ingredients and there are pictures of him plastered over everything so obviously they're not selling the food but the celebrity.  I ordered the Farm Burger which is a burger with bacon and fried egg, fries and a rootbeer. Presentation was good so I was still expecting some redeeming value out of the $35 I needed to lay down for this. Sadly dissapointing. The food looked good but it was very average. The fries were a bit crisper than most but for $8 they should blow your mind away. The curry and chipotle ketchups are worthless. Don't bother, it seems like they just picked two names they thought would jive with the Gordon Ramsey sheep crowd and threw two off the shelf sauces together that don't mix. The bottled rootbeer was of the fructose corn syrup kind.  $15 burger, $8 fries, $5 rootbeer, tax, tip = $35!!! That's a rip off even by Vegas standards when you're flat out drunk and looking to get your beef pangs quelled. I can't imagine why anyone would get ripped off twice. They must figure it'll have a several year run with the unwitting Vegas one timers and then close shop.  If you feel like you have to spend $35, go to Jean Philippe and get 3 sandwiches for you and two friends. Or even go to a nice restaurant and get an entree. You'll at least feel like you've got your money's worth and a MUCH more satisfied palate.  The only redeeming values of the place that gives it 2 stars are the girls' slightly nice outfits and the service. I can't imagine ever paying that much again for just that though. I feel violated. I was never a fan of the hack Gordon Ramsey but am actually now a huge disbeliever. There are some good celebrity chefs out there that are true chefs like Mario Batali and even Wolfgang Puck has surprised me but this GR guy is not one of them."}
{"text":"My friends & I were in Vegas a couple months ago. We actually went to BurGR twice in the same night. The 2nd time mainly due to convenience. We were staying at the hotel and it was the only thing open & close. When we approached at 1 something in the morning the hostess station had about 4 people just lingering and socializing. The girl who helped us was about 20 something and not very helpful. When we asked for the food to go they seemed disappointed and reluctant to get us a menu. The food took about 30 minutes which is surprising because it shouldn't take longer to get the food to go. Then when the girl gave us our change, she dropped a coin on the floor, said oh it's a nickel and didn't even bother to pick it up. I picked up the QUARTER and we left. The food is good, but I guess I just expected better personnel from someone so well known!!"}
{"text":"TASTY! We randomly decided to go here for late lunch the beginning of the month on a little Vegas getaway with my honey.   Made it to Planet Hollywood to find a pretty long line.... We decided to wait it out, and we only ended up waiting about 25 minutes or so which was not terrible. I had the Euro Burger had a number of different flavors which went very well together. My other half had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. I had a bite it was ok.. I was expecting more spice and more intense flavors but it was tasty. The burger patty was seasoned well and of course cooked perfectly to our taste of medium, but In all honesty (i am a true carb lover) the best part of the burger was the bun. We also ordered onion rings and parmesan and truffle french fries. The onion rings were delicious, definitely freshly fried. On top of food we added one drink each and after all of that let me tell you we were very full. We expected a huge bill but it was right around $70 which was not terrible at all considering we had drinks and were leaving absolutely stuffed.   Service was great!"}
{"text":"First food was delish! Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger with Just Fries. Burger was very well made with the proper balance of all of it's ingredients. The jalapenos on this burger made it really delish. The fries were quite tasty because they were so natural tasting,..no b.s. ingredients here. There's really only one reason why I'm not giving things place a 5 starts...it's the drink menu. Don't come here expecting delish food AND great drinks. You'll be disappointed with the drinks. They are very fruity and definitely cater to tourists who don't care. However if you don't care about the drinks and just want great food...interpret this review as a 5. As for the staff, seemed friendly and well mannered."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing burger place! This totally takes Holsteins out of my list of favorite burger places.  appetizers: caesar salad and onion rings. I'm lactose intolerant so I had to scrape some of the cheese off of both but they were still delicious!   burGR: the \"Hell's Kitchen\". Definitely the best burger I've had in a while! It had roasted jalapenos and tomatoes, avocado and asadero cheese. Highlight of the night! And of course you can't have a burger without the fries. The fries were delicious but what made it so great was the chipotle ketchup! OH EM GEE!!!!!!  Awesome side note - they have AT LEAST 8 TV'S THERE!!!! GOOD LAWD!!!!!!! You can watch the basketball game, news, American Idol, ANYTHING and ALL AT ONCE! I don't know why people would want to leave hahaha!  Hands down best burger spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good, the \"farm burger\" I had was good, but the service was slow and they didn't have any gluten-free options other than French fries."}
{"text":"With my friends I was able to try these items from the menu:  Blue Burger - This burger was designed for an acquired taste.  If you enjoy the bitter taste of arugula that unlocks the palate for the rest of the burger, then you will enjoy the simple and rustic combination of the cheese and arugula that leaves a bitter but savory taste in your mouth.  Not my cup of tea but my friend loved it.  Britannia Burger - The arugula is masked by the hidden jewel in this burger. The amazing Mango chutney.  Combining the best of sweet and savory, the Britannia is a great choice for someone who is looking to satisfy their stomachs as well as their sweet tooth.  Farm Burger - A burger fit for the protein induced.  The duck breast bacon unfortunately becomes overpowered by the runny egg sandwiched between the two buns.  You need a sensitive palate to differentiate this \"fancy\" burger from one you can make yourself at home.  Earth Burger - This was ordered for the vegetarian at our table.  A huge portobello mushroom replaces the patty and the mix of tomato, fontina cheese and arugula creates a salad of flavors in your mouth.    Fish & Crisp Sandwich - I ordered the fish sandwich, thinking that since Gordon's from the UK, his restaurant must make a damn good fish and chips.  The sandwich was massive and spectacular.  The fish was crisped to a level of buttery perfection.  However, much of the success of this sandwich goes to butter rather than the fish itself.  Shake #4 - It's an Oreo shake, meh.  Truffle Parmesan Fries - This. This was one of the two reasons why BurGR gets five stars from me.  While the burgers themselves were very high quality, the truffle parm sauce was a unique flavor I had never tasted before.  The truffle flavor was overpowering, to the point where it stunk for my nose with every bite I inhaled, but I couldn't stop eating them.  The sauce itself was imbued with the very essence of truffles, a quality that one could taste with every bite!  Sweet Potato Fries - These were also very meh for me.  Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings - The second winner of the table, our server insisted that the onions were shipped to the restaurant from Hawaii, fresh daily.  Regardless, these were some damn good onion rings.  I can understand the high price comes with the Gordon Ramsay brand name, but the meal was well worth it.  In terms of Vegas priced food, BurGR is a damn fine place to eat when you're living it up on the Strip, for all the right reasons."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar...bartenders were cute and attentive.   I ordered \"The Hog Burger\" which was phenomenal.  Juicy, with a bit of sweetness from the Apple butter.   I also ordered the truffle parmesan fries with the truffle ailoi...delicious, generous on the parmesan.   I also washed it all down with the \"#4\" shake which is creme brulle pudding, oreo shake, and oreo cookie.   To top it all off my burger was personally brought out by Hell's Kitchen winner, Christina Wilson.   Great experience overall, great food,  second time dining here."}
{"text":"Ridiculously cold, uncomfortable and awful customer service. After waiting in the line for more than an hour they told us that there is a waiting list for parties of more than two. They seated us at a table that was right in front of the door where the cold breeze was coming from. Manager's name was Jake Eaton and general manager Joana Holtey. They don't belong to this industry as they don't know customer service. The young little girl at the door raised her voice while I was talking to them about how cold and uncomfortable it was. The only good thing about the whole experience was our polite waiter Edward. I ordered hell's burger with jalapeño and avocado and wasn't even good.., it was tasteless, had no spices, they had a big chunk of unseasoned avocado on top.. With a small piece of jalapeño that wasn't evenly distributed. We asked if we could seat at the kitchen bar towards the back to be a bit warmer and They told us they won't sever at the kitchen bar but guess what they seated and served people right in front of our eyes. Go to \"in and out burger\" instead. I'm dead serious. They didn't even gave us free hot tea to warm up!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our group really enjoyed the Euro burger, Earth burger, chicken burger and Hells Kitchen jalapeño burger! Beer drinkers liked the choice of the wide variety of brew on tap. Didn't care that your beverage choices were displayed to you on an iPad that was presented to the table when the server arrived... process took time as each person scrolling through the beers/cocktails delayed the ordering process on an already busy Friday night. However the food was very good, service good and it was a place we would all recommend."}
{"text":"Food was good! I had the Farm Burger and my wife had the Hells Kitchen Burger. We ordered them medium. Mine was closer to medium well, but overall was very good. The combination of duck bacon, cheese, and the perfectly cooked egg that oozed out was great. My wife's Burger was a bit too spicy and she loves spicy food (so make sure you can take the heat: ) . Onion rings and sweat potato fries were great.... The onion rings came with powered sugar... Need I say more? The only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 was the lackluster service. Appetizers with no plates. No apology when the plates came. Other tables had the same stupid basic issue. How would a high-end place not figure out that you can't eat appetizers without plates? Why should the customer have to wait to eat and have to flag someone down."}
{"text":"The burger was fantastic and definitely one of the top 5 burgers I've ever eaten. However the fries where severely lacking, soggy and not at all complimentary to the meal"}
{"text":"I expected to hate this place, but I loved it.  I'm not thrilled by the gourmet burger trend. And I am not a fan of Gordon Ramsay. I ate at his steakhouse at Paris and it did nothing to woo me. When I heard about Burgr, I honestly had no interest. As far as I was concerned it already had two strikes against it. I expected more of the same... all glory, but no guts. However, my husband had lunch there and had a highly enjoyable meal. He returned and again it was top notch, it was no fluke. So, he convinced me to give it a whirl.  We dined Sunday afternoon for lunch. Shortly after opening a line had already formed. We waited just a minute or two before we were welcomed and told that we could receive a text when a table was ready rather than waiting in line. It's a nice touch. We opted to wait it out near the bar since we were told it would be about ten minutes for seating for two.  I admired the beer selection while we waited. A wall of taps is always a beautiful sight to see. I was also impressed with how much restaurant they were able to fit in the old poker room and total rewards booth. They really did a nice job with the space.   Soon we were led to our table and we reviewed the menu. GR is plastered on the outside. This is the glory, I spoke of before. Fortunately, as I opened the menu I saw a glimmer of guts. The menu is simple. I adore restaurants that take the approach to do a few things and do them well.   Our waiter welcomed us and apologized that the iPad drink menus were down, we were in need of rehydration so H2O is all we wanted anyhow so no love lost. We asked to get started with an order of the jalapeno poppers while we perused the menu. Instead of only one fiery surprise, we asked that they all be hot and he happily obliged.  The poppers arrived in individual shot glasses. No sharing of dipping sauce required. This was awesome. There were no popper jousting wars over the sauce and you could even double dip if you wanted. The poppers are coated with panko, which makes the breading light, crisp and crunchy and the best part is that they are filled with cheddar. I was thrilled they didn't ruin them with cream cheese. Cheddar is the way to go and these had robust flavor. The jalapenos were tender and not a drip of water or grease pooled inside. I like spicy so with the seeds they had a bold kick. It was the perfect popper. No joke.  I wished another order was on its way, but I knew we had plenty yet to enjoy. We ordered the sweet potato and truffle fries. It's far too much for two, but I love sweet potato fries and the husband loves steak fries. Neither of us are usually to fond of the other. But these? They are an exception. I didn't use the powdered sugar and I could do without the jalapeno mayo because the sweet potato fries were just right on there own. Fried crisp, yet fluffy in the center and not the least bit greasy. I was in heaven. They even won over my husband because of the jalapeno mayo he loved the sweet and spicy mix. The truffle fries were intoxicating from the moment they arrived. The scent of truffle oil is unmistakable. I was afraid the fries might be soggy or goopy, but no crisp and fluffy. I'm usually hate on steak fries but these were pretty darn tasty, uniform with skins and maybe soaked in a salt water bath? I'm not sure of the secret that sets them apart, but well done. Homemade ketchup and black truffle aioli accompany the truffle fries, but no sauce is required.  Now on to the burgers, the Chanterelle for him and Hells Kitchen for me. Now the chanterelle burger is misleading it comes with argula and figgy-onion jam, but the mushrooms are not the star, it's that figgy-onion jam that shines. The onions are so wonderfully carmelized the sweetness is stellar, imagine French onion soup wrapped in a soft chewy bun. The chanterelles earthy flavor was lost, but I'm not complaining as a whole it works. It was a fantastic burger! It's just that the figgy onion jam is undersold.   My Hells Kitchen was grilled to a perfect medium and had a great bun to meat ratio just like the Chanterelle, but it was the weakest link of the meal. Don't get me wrong it was a good burger with asadero cheese, avocado and jalapeno. But I wanted heat, with a name like Hell's Kitchen I was expecting a fiery bite, but it was a wimper. Heat didn't even register with my tastebuds.   We weren't planning to get dessert, but watching the shakes go by was too tempting especially after a second look at the menu. The Oreo shake was right up my husband's alley and the hazelnut and coffee was made for me. We took the shakes to go. They were the ideal cool treat for a hot day. Creamy and luscious from the pudding.  Prices are on par with the gourmet burger joints, but this one actually warrants the price tag. Service was great even though the restaurant was slammed. Guts and glory, well played Burgr. Well played."}
{"text":"I m a big fan of Ramsay's \"Hell\" series.  Everything is okay about this restaurant.  But the design of the table is the worst.  Table is too low n waiter/waitress look at you like Hawk Eye.  Ramsay, how you put this German architectural design into your restaurant ;)"}
{"text":"I have to say this place does not live up to Gordon Ramsey's name. I love his shows and decided to try one of his restaurants. You will not be satisfied after waiting in that atrocious line next to the hot fire. The burGRs were whatever, lacked flavor and I could've gotten something like that anywhere.  Although I did like the fries and the price was fair, only about 10 dollars a burger. If you've ever tried any gourmet burger places and compare it to this one, it will disappoint! Holsteins at Cosmo is 10xs better if you want a gourmet burger that is out of this world."}
{"text":"Amazing burger, great service and cool atmosphere. I am a fan of Chef Ramsey and was certainly hoping this place lived up to the hype, which it did. The Hells Kitchen burger was amazing no ketchup needed! The server we had was very nice, beautiful and informative!  Overall, a great experience. If you have a Platinum card or higher with Total Rewards, you can bypass the line as well, which was pretty awesome. Although the wait was only like 15 mins"}
{"text":"The wife and I were enjoying a day playing tourists and we decided to give Burger a try. I have eaten at other restaurants owned by Gordon Ramsay and know his food is worth every penny. The menu offered several different burgers with a variety of different toppings along with other options. The staff was very friendly and offered good customer service. The food as expected was incredible. My wife ordered a$9 milkshake and I thought she lost her mind but after tasting it I agreed it was worth every penny."}
{"text":"Like many others the day I went, I was at Burgr to see if a Gordon Ramsay backed establishment was truly up to snuff. Based on Chef's abrasive ways, anything less than awesome was going to be a let down, but I was hoping that the food here would back up his tough talk. While it wasn't bad, what I had represented a mixed bag...  I ordered the $13 American Burger...It was an above average burger, featuring high quality beef, ripe tomato, butter lettuce and nice cheese on a fresh bun. Solid flavor, and a good bread/veggie/meat ratio...no real flaws, but not an elite burger -- I'll give it an A-minus...  The fries, however were a bust. They were salty, dry, mealy, steak cut fries accompanied by ambitious house-made seasoned ketchup that didn't play well with the potatoes. Good old Heinz ketchup (not available) might have saved  the day.  Service was good -- we had a seat at the bar, but my dining companion's truffle-oil fries were cold (maybe they sat while my burger was on the way?) and she wasn't fan of them, especially the accompanying  ketchup.   Note to Gordon -- if you are going to aggressively spare your diners the indignity of Heinz ketchup, then your house made stuff had better be a home run. It wasn't even close and one of the choices offered tasted like slightly less-processed McNugget dipping sauce..."}
{"text":"C'était top et on s'est bien marré  It was great and we had fun, but there is some problem with scales.  The chair are so tiny that we can't eat properly on the table, and the dessert in a smoothie glass was SOOO big that the straw comes into my nose :)  but well the burger are good and french fries (why french you have to told me, Im french and for us fries are belgian not french, but well) are awsome.   We ate too much and I want to come back :D"}
{"text":"Absolutely dreadful. Waited in line for an hour thinking it would be over the top yum. Instead it was gross plus we had to wait another 30 minutes after ordering to get out food which was cold and disappointing and missing key ingredients. Don't order the chicken burger unless you like ground chicken? Weird. The fries were decent but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my Hells Kitchen Burger, cooked perfectly and wonderful flavors. The truffle fries were also very good and for dessert I can strongly recommend the Oreo and Cream Brûlée milkshake!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurant for a long time and it didn't disappoint. We shared onion rings with two sauces (one of them was SO amazing, the other one was good too). I had the farm burger which was very tasty cooked to perfection.   The restaurant itself is very beautiful with a fire lit logo. The beer glasses are beautiful. Nice furniture etc."}
{"text":"Shakes topped with pudding? Novel idea but not textually pleasant to slurp pudding. Even after mixing the pudding and shake components together, it was just overly sweet and non-descript.  Truffle fries were crisp and well seasoned. The sweet potato fries were straightforward but the powdered sugar was unnecessary and made them too sweet as a side for the burgers.   I had the mangalitsa pork burger and the hubs had the burger with the chilies and avocado (Hell's Kitchen burger? ).  Both burgers were a little on the small side for the price. Although decently seasoned and had a gentle char flavor, they both were in need of just a little more salt. They were both moist with complimentary condiments but at the price point, I really expected an awesome burger. Alas, it was not and I'd say skip this place for one that doesn't charge as much and for every side."}
{"text":"Truffle fries and jalapeño poppers are highly recommended!  Burgers are flavorful and prepared just right.  Shakes are a bit thick.  If you love juicy burgers, it's worth the wait. Tip: Try to avoid dining peak hours, the wait may only be 15-20 minutes.  Otherwise, the line would take 40 minutes."}
{"text":"This was the best burger I've ever had. Everything was seasoned wonderfully, and cooked to perfection.  The average price per burger is $15.99.  Everything is ala Carte thought.  You must try Gordon Ramsey's signature dessert the Sticky Toffee push up pudding.  IT IS WONDERFUL!!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here as a party of 4 and it took an hour and 35 minutes to be seated! So we checked in at 8:30 and we didn't have a seat until 10pm and we didn't get done with dinner until midnight! I had the chicken burger and it was ok but definitely not worth the $15 and the extreme wait. I also had the Parmesan fries which to me where over cooked and extra crispy. Overall, I wasn't a fan of the over priced mediocre burgers with a very long wait!"}
{"text":"Went to Gordon Ramsey Burger, as a person whos lived and frequents Las Vegas often...let me just say....What an experience, food was amazing, service was quick and confident and the Milk Shake was what I Imagine heaven is like. I had the Gordon Burger (special) And my other dining partner had the euro burger...along with Maui onion rings and HAND CUT.....YES HAND CUT....Parmigiano Reggiano truffle fries....Wow is all I can say....The burger was not greasy or flat tasting, the bun was soft and very fresh with black Sesame seeds.....absolutely outstanding all around...ambiance is noisy but it's a burger joint on the strip...it's supposed to be like that....it's very clean which is a big deal for me...and let me just say you won't be hammered with the price at all....the two of us was 69$ and I left a 15$ tip so 85$ with no alcohol......but worth every dollar. I highly recommend giving this place a try.....will I be back????? ABSOLUTELY"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here every time we were in Vegas but the line was always too long. This time around it wasn't too bad so we gave it a try. I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsey so I had high expectations about this place and I'm happy to say that the food was beyond of what I expected. The burgers were amazing and scrumptious. I had the truffle burger and my husband had the farm house duck bacon burger. The shake no.5 was something I never tried before and it was so good, a must try if you love nutella! Everything was delicious. The service was okay not all that great but it's Vegas so It is what it is. I'm looking forward to eating here again when we come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, burger was very juicy and tasteful, a true pleasure to eat. The fries were weak, I expected better.  Ending the meal with a very good adult shake (when in Vegas) was a nice touch! I will absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Nom! 4.5 stars.  We waited 45 min for a table which I expected, but then another while to order our food... and then felt like an eternity to GET our food. In reality it was probably 20 min, but I was starving at that point.  Gordon Ramsay really delivers here. We got a Hell's Kitchen burger, Farm burger, and truffle fries. I think the prices are very reasonable, even pre-discount (I think any Total Rewards card gives you $1 off the price of each item).  Per our usual routine, hubby and I shared both burgers. I can usually pick which one I like better but not this time. Both very different from each other and equally stellar. It may look smallish but we were so full we couldn't finish the fries. Oh, those fries... just enough truffle taste, finely grated parmesan that were good enough on their own or in either homemade sauce. I'm salivating now.  Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"It was a nice choice for one of our nights in Vegas. We had to make the cue a little bit, but it was worthy. The burgers were tasty and good. The size, smaller than usual, but it was nice. The fries and the onion rings were the perfect company. Perhaps a little bit pricey."}
{"text":"I had the hells  kitchen burger yesterday, I have to say it was the best burger I ever had! Ever! The meat was cooked to perfection, every bite was tender, juicy, and flavourful. It is quite spicy! However, our server was polite yet very absent minded. The appetizer we ordered arrived after we finished our burger. We tried to flag him down a few times to break the bill, he just never saw us. Food was great but service is important too!"}
{"text":"More of a lunch place than a dinner. Lunch will also save you time since there is always a line to get in.  Burgers are good, but not great.  Fries are good, ketchups are great.  Stay away from the cocktails unless you want to pay $12 for a glass of orange juice or pop. There is little to none booze in the cocktails. Beer is the alcohol choice here.  Shakes are divine.  Service is good and friendly.  Watch out the cutlery and the glassware, full of water stains.  Overall, three stars for a premium burger joint..."}
{"text":"We love GR and were so excited to eat here. The onion rings were awesome. The meatless portobello burger was good but a little on the salty side. Not a place for kids who are picky eaters. Prices were reasonable and food was great but the place mats and the table smelled like mildew,  like someone used am old rag on eveything.  Atmosphere was nice.  Love the fire sign in the front!"}
{"text":"Delicious. About as good as I could perceive burgers and fries to be. All five of us enjoyed our food. A heads up, the fresh brewed iced tea is unsweetened and sugar doesn't really dissolve in it. Also, the food is quite filling. I had a large meal but was still quite full hours later."}
{"text":"I order the hell's kitchen burger. It was really good I enjoyed it. Also got the truffle fries. It was good especially with the truffle aloi sauce."}
{"text":"Great food - no fuss at all.   Try the milkshakes and the sticky toffee pudding pops - so good.   Definitely will be coming back; great place to try Gordon Ramsay's food at affordable prices."}
{"text":"Just because a well known chef puts his name on on something does not make it great. Of the 3 dishes we ordered, 2 were barely okay and one was good, but not great. My burger was tasty enough ..fries (truffle and sweet potato) were okay. Hot dog,eh and fish sandwich not so good. Service was bad...very non attentive and incredibly slow. All our server needed to do was acknowledge that food was being prepared, that they were busy, apologize...anything and we would have been fine. But instead we sat ignored us for 40 minutes while we waited for food. We all intended to order their fun looking desert but after all that we decided against it. And the worst part, I watched another server complain TO THE CUSTOMER as he was leaving about the size of the tip he was left. Shameful. Too many good places for me to EVER return to this place."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and great experience. Wait staff was so friendly. The unique burger flavor combinations paired were wonderful."}
{"text":"Really great place to eat! Food is great and since we came later there was absolutely no wait. Was also happy that this was one of the few places that stay open late on a Sunday night  loved that the manager was happily walking around checking up on the guests as well. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried every burger in the world but I'm pretty confident this is the best burger in America. The ingredients in this burger are top notch. I have never tasted beef like this before. You can really taste the quality and you can see the level of care the chefs put into making these burgers. I was stunned at how this high class restaurant by Gordon Ramsey only sold burgers. I went with the Farm House Burger which has duck bacon and an egg. It was a really special experience and the best part is that you enjoy every single bite. The sweet potato fries are really good but the truffle fries are a must try. We even ordered some jalapeño bombers that were served individually in shot glasses that were really hot and fresh. The jalapeño was really spicy. Not only do i want to come back but i am excited to try other Gordon Ramsey restaurants on the Vegas strip. This was definitely a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"The hostess said it might be an 1-1.5 hour wait but it turned out to only be 20 min. The sweet potato fries and euro burger were very good. Burger undercooked just a little. The sticky toffee pops are unique but not as good as the original. Service very good. Little bit of a wait for the food to come out."}
{"text":"Wow!! Best burger I have had in such a long time! I got the Gordon Ramsay burger and onion rings. The burger had duck bacon which was a little like turkey bacon but better. The flavors here just blend so well together. The service is fast and the waiters were so polite and helpful about the menu questions we had.  I love this place! I always try to stop by here when I am in town!"}
{"text":"I went here expecting an overrated and overpriced restaurant, but instead, it was the complete opposite. I love burgers, and this is the place to go in Vegas if you love it too.  Price is pretty much like Applebee's. Quality is great. Service was excellent. Just delicious!  I wish there was a branch here in LA!"}
{"text":"!! MUST TRY!!  I had the fury chicken wings (which our waiter recommended & explained that it is a 3 day process to prepare) as a appetizer, the yardbird burger as a entree (chicken burger) the skinny lemonade as my cocktail,  & the coffee shake for dessert. EVERYTHING was PHENOMENAL.   Our server JAY was superb & we definitely will be back with friends & family  #HappyGirl"}
{"text":"Our party of four waited close to an hour for a table (but the roulette table was close by and time just seemed to fly by) and the food was definitely worth the wait!  The Farm Burger (with duck breast bacon and fried egg) was simply amazing and the Oreo milkshake to die for. The waitress was so remarkably friendly and chatty. For a Gordon Ramsay establishment and for it's location on the Las Vegas strip, the prices are just unbeatable!"}
{"text":"Loved it! The burgers are great and the fries are awesome, one order is enough to share!"}
{"text":"After watching Gordon Ramsey chew people out on Kitchen Nightmares for standing around and doing nothing and for watching him yell at head chef's on the show for not expediting, I was shocked to see over 10 people standing around in the open kitchen and the head chef standing and talking to a couple patrons for the entire 1.5 hours we were there.  The irony!    As for the food... The wings looked amazing, but were just ok.  I preferred the red ones over the green since they had more flavor.   The truffle fries were great!  Really liked those.  Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  It was juicy and ground from chuck, brisket and short rib, which is a great combination, but it was definitely under seasoned.  The housemate sesame bun was a nice touch, but nothing distinguishable.  Our server was very knowledgeable and friendly and took the time to share lots of information about the place with us.  All in all a solid 3 stars for my first Gordon Ramsey experience."}
{"text":"5 stars for the burger (Hell's kitchen burger). I especially liked the gigantic bun-sized jalapeno in the burger.  Fries were meh.  Compared to Holstein's which I tried on the same trip, I would say BurGR has the better burger but Holstein's has better ambience and fries."}
{"text":"By far onr of the best burgers I ate in Vegas. Their fries wings and onion rings are awesome. Euro Burger was delicious."}
{"text":"Had time to kill before our flight so we stopped in for a quick bite.  Luckily we had lots of time because the line was long. Big fan of Gordon Ramsay so we were excited to give this place a try. His food is always spot on so the only reason they didn't get 5-stars was because of the service.  Bar service and bar tables were included in the main seating so no matter what, you had to wait in line to be seated. The hostesses were just chatting with each other while the people in line were wondering why they weren't seating us when there was visible open seats.  With open seats at the bar a guy by himself just walked up to the hostess and asked if he could sit down and they said sure so that pissed off us and the couple behind us. We immediately complained and were seated at the bar.  Food options were pretty simple.  We ordered:  - Truffle Parmesan Fries - Euro Burger - Hog Burger  Food took forever but when it finally arrived it didn't disappoint.  From the time we got in line to when we paid our bill was probably an hour and 45 minutes.  Luckily we made our flight."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend after a long day of walking around the strip. We waited in line for maybe 30 minutes, which isn't so bad. When it was our turn to get seats, we got the bar. The bartenders were funny and friendly so it made it an even better experience. For the food, I had the farm burger and some of the truffle fries.  The Farm burger intrigued me because of the duck bacon. I love duck and I love bacon so I really wanted to see what duck bacon was all about. It was crispy and delicious. The burger also had a fried egg. I like how the egg yolk flows out and gives the burger a sauce. I got the burger medium rare so the meat was moist.   The truffle fries were delicious, definitely recommend. It came with ketchup and some salty garlic dipping sauce? Either way, I wish I had a bigger stomach and a faster metabolism so i could finish more of it. =]  I would go back again if I had the chance."}
{"text":"Probably the best value you'll find on the strip. Lineup wasn't terribly long either. Loved the burger. Parm fries held the meal back. Good shake."}
{"text":"Had a great, albiet expensive, lunch here on our Vegas trip. We stayed at the Planet Hollywood and only ended up here because passing by it to get to the strip it smelled so amazing. We went for lunch and did not wait long (maybe 5 mins) to be seated. Dinner time this place seemed totally packed. For lunch, he restaurant was pretty full and the line filled up immediately after we got sat. Good timing.  While everything is reasonably priced ($13-$15 a burger isn't terrible) we threw in an appetizer and some parm truffle fries, and a couple of beers, to total out a roughly $85 lunch.  We started with a couple beers, our server was incredibly knowledgable and helped us out by giving us a couple samples when he had the chance. We also got the Jalapeno Poppers which were delicious. Although it's supposed to have 5 poppers and one spicy surprise (a 6th popper with the seeds still in tact) we had 3 with seeds still in tact, which we didn't hate. Very spicy but very good. The presentation was very cool and original, putting each popper in it's own shot glass of ranch, but we did find by the time we got to the last few, the crispy exterior of those remaining poppers became soggy with the ranch.  The girlfriend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, which she enjoyed (though couldn't eat it all). I had the Farm Burger, which had the OverEasy egg, Duck bacon, and sharp english cheddar. The cheese wasn't as sharp as i'd hoped and the duck bacon was a nice touch. I love a good egg on a burger and this did not disappoint.  The burgers are delicious but definitely big enough to share if you want to do an app and fries. The fries are ala carte, but the truffle parm fries were definitely the highlight of the meal. At times the toppings were a bit heavy with parm but you can shake some of that off onto the rest, or suck it up and enjoy it. hahaha. The fires are big enough to share for 2 or 3 also.  Our server, damnit that I would forget his name now, made our experience very smooth and nice. He picked out a great beer for the girlfriend (aged with rum and whiskey), and was prompt with any requests we had.  The elusive 5th star is only for reasons of pickiness and the know that while it was a great and delicious experience, it is just that. An experience. Something we would possibly not do on our next visit to save the chance for another restaurant to blow us away, or maybe just to vie for a cheaper, quicker lunch. But if you are a big burger fan, like a little variety to the burger option, and are big Gordon Ramsey nerds like us, this was definitely a great lunch option if you have the coin to spare on the meal."}
{"text":"Went here as I love Gordon Ramsay. The food did not disappoint.  I opted for the hell's kitchen burger, the beef was cooked to my liking and was flavoursome and seasoned well. The bread was soft and was of a good quality. My partner opted for the fish finger sandwich which was a huge portion and was served with thin salt and vinegar crisps. Both dishes were enjoyable.  We also opted for some gooey fries to share which came which a poached egg on top and two types of cheese. The portion was massive and sadly we could not finish it! For drink I ordered the butterscotch milkshake,  this was very thick and filling and more like a dessert then a milkshake but it was nice none the less.  Food here is reasonably priced especially for Vegas and the fact that it is a  Gordon Ramsay restaurant. The service here was also good and we received a visit from the manager whilst dining asking how everything was."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Hell's Kitchen burger (roasted jalapeños, jalapeño pesto aioli, roasted tomatoes, and avocados), it was probably the best burger I've ever had in my entire life (once it was cooked correctly..see below) So why didn't I give this place 5 stars?  The only thing we ordered was the Hell's Kitchen burger and an American burger and it took us almost 45 minutes to receive our food (this is after waiting in a line around 30-45min to be seated....they do not take names or reservations).    I ordered my burger well done and received a raw burger and had to send it back.  It took an additional 20 minutes to get it back...with no apology, nothing..just an excuse that the kitchen was busy.  :-/  Our server was terrible.  We hardly ever saw her and when we did see her, she seemed very rushed.  At the end of our meal, she just gave us our bill and didnt even ask if we cared for dessert.    Burgers were around $15 and did not include any sides.  Fries are an additional $8.  The place is super packed and so loud because all the tables are right on top of one another.  I had to basically scream across the table to have a conversation with my husband."}
{"text":"I went to this place with my family. Be a Saturday night, we figured there would be a wait. We went to the front and put our name in. They use a system where they text you when your table is ready, which was convenient because we were able to walk around the casino/mall.   Pros: The service was great. People there are friendly and very knowledgable. Their onion rings, fries, truffle fries, chicken wings, and all the sauces were really delightful.   Cons: Upon arrival, our placemats were sticky as if they weren't cleaned properly. Second, the reviews stated \"kid friendly\" but there's no kid menu. But, to their credit, the server was knowledgable and told us to order wings, or a hotdog with no condiments, which worked out for my niece. Lastly, I ordered the farmers burger, medium well. My burger was well done and the fried egg was overcooked. I was expecting a runny egg yolk.   Thoughts: the place is overall great. I'd rate it and 8.5/10. Good food. I would come back again."}
{"text":"Gordan Ramsey can be proud of his own restaurant. Burgers were flavorful. Got the Chanterelle Burger (chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, figgy-onion jam) and Farm Burger (egg, sharp cheddar, and duck breast bacon). Although both burgers were extremely juicy they held together well and didn't fall apart as some other juicy burgers tend to do. The truffle Parmesan fries were ok. They were fat fries but tasted and felt kind of old. Nothing special there. Service was ok not great but food came out fast. A little side note, the wait was about 25 min for a party of two but the line next to the sign on fire was kind of annoying because it was already a hot day, and the heat from the sign just made it even hotter lol. Overall, glad I got to try one of the higher rated places in Vegas. Will come again"}
{"text":"Was hoping this food was amazing but sadly food has no flavor what so ever! Pricing was ok but would never come back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had the Hells Kitchen burger and I had the chantrelle burger added fontina cheese, truffle fries, sweet potato fries, Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pops. Everything was amazing and perfect! Wouldn't expect less for Gordon Ramsey..."}
{"text":"The wait was exhausting and the food could have been better.  I ordered Hell's Kitchen burger, which was average;  I was expecting a lot of flavor,  which it lacked.  The bun was fresh, I am expecting a burger that will make me want to come back and order it again, sadly that was not the case,  and the host could have been a little more friendly."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is damn good...HANDS DOWN....it may take awhile in line and also once u order the food but TOTALY WORTH IT!! Service is good as well"}
{"text":"Truffle parmesean fries...to die for. The aioli really tips them over the *best ever* edge. Their staff is wonderful and extremely helpful. My husband elbowed his glass off the table by accident, it shattered and it was terribly embarassing.  The staff, however, made a crappy situation much better. They swifty cleaned, offered help, gave first aid and also made me feel comfortable enough that neither he nor I died of embarassment. You can imagine how many eyes were on us lol. Anyway,  Burgr is awesome. Go there!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in the Farm Burger ,served medium rare. It was a sinewy mess of low grade beef, zero flavor, and gross beef parts. Our waitress was a ditz who cared more about her shoddy eye make up than our order. also, this eatery (I won't call it a restaurant) is literally in the entry way of the Planet Hollywood casino. you can watch tourists from the Bible Belt wasting their life away while u try to enjoy \"gourmet\" grub. yeah, the wait is long and the food falls short. most fast food joints are better than this sham"}
{"text":"FIVE STAR EXPERIENCE extremely attentive and knowlegable wait staff.  we went in the middle of a shift change.  the waitress introduced us to our new waiter...the transition went smoothly.  staff knew their products and were always willing to go the extra mile food was amazing!  we ordered the japaleno poppers, onion rings, and the euro burger...omg!  my husband is the epitomy of a carnivore.  he loves steaks and burgers.  however, whenever he eats a burger he does this super IRRITATING ritual.  he typically takes a bite...puts it down then says \"mine are better.\"  it typically NEVER fails.  i didnt think here would be any different.  today, he looked at the burger picked it up and took a bite...then he did something he NEVER does...he took another bite...then another...and another.  when he was competely finished he stated, \"perfection.\"  the bun was slightly crisp at the edges but warm and soft in the center.  the patty was perfectly seasoned and wonderfully juicy.  it was awesomeness on a plate.   we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"The pros: the food was great! I ordered the hells kitchen burger as recommended on the menu. It was delicious! Perfectly well done and juicy... Yum!!! The truffle fries were great. And, the price wasn't bad for Vegas. Fun environment with the open kitchen.  Cons: the decor was a little kitschy. They brought different fries than what we ordered, but, they were good. And, while the service was VERY attentive, one bus boy was a bit too eager to clear... But he was meticulously cleaning the whole time, and the place gleamed."}
{"text":"Excelente melhor hambúrguer que já provei não tem nada como provar um verdadeiro hambúrguer de chef se vc vier em las Vegas não pode deixar de ir!!!!"}
{"text":"Didn't wait so long to get seated, got the Gooey Fries, and Hell's Kitchen Burger. The burger wasn't as expected, it wasn't good but it wasn't bad either. The gooey fries I like but a bit too cheesy. I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"I stopped in around 5pm and was seated straight away at the bar. Courteous staff and attentive. Decent selection of beers on tap and a nice menu of burgers. I went classic and had the American burger with the parmesan truffle fries (actually chips if you come from the UK) as they are hand cut.  Burger was juicy, good flavor with home made ketchup. Chips were very good and the bad thing was they seem to disappear too quickly.  1 beer, burger and fries came to $40 with tip. Expensive hence giving it a 4/5. Otherwise, it's worth a stop if your hankering for a good burger."}
{"text":"Being a huge fan of all of Ramsay's shows I knew I had to come and check this place out, in all honesty I don't get what all the fuss is about...the food is alright, would I come back? Nope! I had the farmer burger medium rare with the duck bacon and fried egg with a side of truffle fries. the patty on the burger itself was nothing special but the fried egg and duck bacon tasted pretty good. the truffle parm fries were good as well but once again nothing special. Service was on point so points on that but all in all not what I was expecting especially with a the name Gordon Ramsay Burgr. Sorry the food wasn't better..."}
{"text":"Good in overall, 10 mins waiting in line but not too crowed as expected. We ordered three different burgers and all taste good."}
{"text":"Love love this place!!! I come back here just to get their Creme Brûlée Oreo Milkshake!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers and excellent customer service. We ordered the chicken wings for starters and then the truffle fries with the hells kitchen burger and the Gordon burger which is on the secret menu"}
{"text":"When visiting in Vegas it really is difficult at times to find a decent place to eat without spending a couple 100 bucks. If you're looking for a good burger this is the place to come. You'll spend 13-17 dollars on a burger (with no side) but it really is tasty. You can tell that the ingredients are good quality and you don't feel greasy and fat afterwards. I got my burger togo and waited about 10 minutes, which isn't terrible. By looks they also had a good selection of beers on draft."}
{"text":"So far the best place we've eaten in Vegas. And extremely reasonably priced. The sweet potato fries are to die for. And Shake #5 which came highly recommended from another review was so good we finished it off first before we got our burgers. The staff was super friendly as well. We've recommended it now multiple times to others."}
{"text":"Longue attente ensuite attendre pour recevoir notre burger banal par contre frite à truffe excellente prix élevé pour ce type de repas"}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked to medium and make sure you ask for regular ketchup for fries. Ketchup is made freshly in house, much better than Heinz."}
{"text":"This place should be called fries not Burgr my buddy and I had his chicken burgers they were both terrible ended up sending them back. My burger was suppose to be spicy with blue cheese and coleslaw the blue cheese over powered the burger and there was no spice to it. The only decent thing was the fries but even they had too much parm on them. Very disappointed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a great time, the waitress was nice and helpful. The food was yummy until we got back to the hotel. I was fine, but my boyfriend ended up getting food poisoning from his burger. He had no alcohol and the only thing we didn't share was his burger. It is a good place, but check your food first."}
{"text":"Richard Pro here with another review.  A dismal experience. We were seated promptly and got a prime location: right next to the BURGR window bathed bright in flames. It was majestic and the folded menu.and decals on the plates were a nice touch.  Restaurant wasn't that busy so we got our food promptly. Prices are around $15-20 for a decently sized burger. I was expecting a mouthful of flavor and a well seasoned patty but I got neither. It was a very mediocre burger that you can order anywhere in America.  I also tried the highly recommended gooey fries (per yelp) and found them to be a letdown. Steak fries that are sorta mushy with an unbearable amount of plain melted cheese with shaved salami. A dish that can be easily made at home shouldn't be $13 and most certainly shouldn't be served in a gordon ramsay restaurant.  2 stars. Highly forgettable. The epitome of pretentiousness because the Gordon Ramsay label  in this instance means absolutely nothing. I guarantee you've all had better."}
{"text":"I checked out this gourmet burger place while I was in Vegas.  Went in for lunch around Noon on a Saturday and the place was *packed*.  40 minute wait for lunch.  I snagged a seat at the bar and avoided the wait.  Service was a little slow, but it was really crowded, so I'll give them a free pass.  Probably should take off  half a star because it was a little hard to eat lunch when every 5 minutes someone would shove their way up to the crowded bar and order a beer.  The bartenders should really try to guide the beer ordering masses to a spot along the bar where they won't be jammed between two people trying to enjoy lunch whilst saying things like \"Tell me about a craft beer on tap that is *different*\"  I had the Uber Cheeseburger and fries.  Burger was perfect in every sense of the word.  The fries were some of the best I've ever had; crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and perfectly salted.  They serve two different types of house-made ketchup, I didn't care for the Curry Ketchup.  If you are in Vegas, definitely give this place a try if you are in the mood for a burger.  It's in the Planet Hollywood hotel, right off of the casino floor towards the doors that open onto the strip."}
{"text":"We came here pretty late at night on a Sunday and got seated within 10-15 minutes. My husband and I decided on the Fish Sandwich and regular fries to share (I know...ordering a Fish Sandwich at a Burger Joint..but we are both super picky about burgers). Well, lucky for us after one bite, we both proclaimed BEST. FISH. SANDWICH we have ever had!!! So for you pescatarians out there, you will be in heaven.   The fish is fresh, buttery and crisp, the bun is nicely toasted, the crunchy salted vinegar chips on top add wonderful texture and the tartar sauce is creamy with a nice lemony zing. I thought the fries were decent too, my husband liked the smokey tomatoey ketchup they came with. We decided to come back the next day and order the same thing for lunch - but as most sequels - it did not taste AS wonderful as the first."}
{"text":"I will never eat here again ! The girls working as hostesses have no clue of customer service . We waited in line for over 35 minutes for a burger . Once we got seated we placed our order and the people next to us who came in 10 minutes after got their food well before us . The young lady who brought us our food told me the burger takes 30 to 40 minutes . The manager came over and asked how everything was and I told him the food was fine and the service was terrible ! He really did not seem to care . I have never written a review before but I felt the service was so bad I had to let people know that if you want to over pay for a burger with terrible customer service this is the place . This was all based on my experience today and they have lost me as a customer for life ."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try the food here because of the celebrity status of the chef, it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I ordered the Farm Burger and the Truffle Fries based on reviews I read. Now don't get me wrong, the burger and fries were good, but they weren't amazing enough for me to order them again. My burger was a little dry, the flavors were a bit bland, even with the fried egg. The truffle fries didn't have nearly as much truffle oil or parmesan cheese as I would have liked. It was an okay experience. I would be open to coming again to try other burgers though, but if I had to choose one place to go in Vegas for burgers, this wouldn't immediately be my top choice."}
{"text":"Best flatbread and humus!  We had two burgers: Britannia Was amazing, would definitely have again; Chanterelle was ok, but didn't love it (because mushrooms were soggy).     Great sizes, fast service, honest price, though crowded atmosphere. But, that's what we expected the environment to be, so no problem!"}
{"text":"Your host staff girls were very courteous and found a very good table for me my friend and my service dog. It showed me that you truly care about your customers and your staff is very well trained. Thank you very much."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas on business and wanted a good meal without the giant pricetag.  Vegas has amazing food, and you pay for it.  But, this restaurant made it possible to enjoy amazing food and service without mortgaging the house.  I loved it!  So did my husband.  He is still talking about that burger.  I am a vegetarian and really enjoyed the portobella burger.  Shared some ymmy fries and had a glass of bubbles.  They had just received their new champagne glasses, which are wonderful.  Even the server, Mia, hadn't seen them and commented.  Speaking of Mia, she was delightful and knowledgeable.  I will go back the next chance I get!"}

{"text":"Love your food, but Jesus Christ-- add some benches in your line for the people that have to wait 1+ hours in line. The fire next to your line also makes waiting very uncomfortable. Fire without AC nearby = hot and sweaty customers"}
{"text":"Went there last night.  Would like to preface this by saying I went at 1am on a Saturday night and it was busy.  This place is open air and has an eye catching sign.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for a table.  Since it was late, my fiancé and I shared 3 items.  The Creme Brûlée shake was so unique and delicious.  The aspect of adding the pudding on top as a layer was amazing.  One note,  it is a gut buster...very filling.  The onion rings were amazing, best I have ever had.  The farm burger was very good!!!  The ingredients tasted premium and it was well prepared.  Our server was great, he even suggested a lower priced burger because he liked it better.  I respected that. That being said it took forever to get what we ordered and that was the only real drawback, but hey, it was 1am.  I will be back!"}

Thank you.."}

{"text":"I would safely consider my husband and myself food snobs. This was one of the best burgers we've ever had! Our server Alex awesome!! He was by far and above my favorite waiter from our whole Las Vegas trip. He is super fun, knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"1 star for their service. waited 35 minutes in line. no big deal. got sat at the bar to speed things up. as soon as we sat down we ordered a burger and a shake to share. after 30 minutes our burger arrived, but no milk shake so we asked them about it. they said let me check on it. after a few minutes he came back and said they're making it. then we waited another 10 minutes and asked about the shake again and got the same reply. so we asked them to get it togo. the cashier came back and told us they can't put the shake in a togo cup because they had already made it (no idea how that's even an excuse) but they said they can't do it. so, we waited again for almost another 10 mins and told the cashier to cancel the shake because their service is ridiculous. and we sat at the bar!!! they called a manager over to refund us for the shake and it took almost 10 minutes for them to do the refund and we paid in cash.   worst service ever."}
{"text":"The best burger I ate since arrived at CA... And the fries with parmesan... Nhamiii!!! Loved everything... Even the price... Too fair!!! ;-) Just the wait time... Not so cool. :-( But ok, nothing like: OMG. Haha."}
{"text":"a bit pricy but really good and the queue to get to get in isn't that bad"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?  THE M*THER F#CKING CURSING: Let's start at the end. As hubby and I were waiting for our check to be picked up (shortest wait of the evening), I thought I heard someone doing some serious cursing. \"What the f#ck is wrong with you?\" \"I'm not going to have this sh*t!\" \"I don't wanna see f$cking gouda!\" Of course I ceased all conversation and listened to what turned out to be the chef berate his kitchen staff for a solid 10 minutes. And let me be clear, it was loud. And he did not hold any words back. And it went on and on and on. I don't watch Hells Kitchen, but I know that in America, Ramsey is known for his temper (on his reality show). I just never expected to witness a bit of Hell's Kitchen during a lovely dinner.  One employee commented that this was Chef having a \"good night.\" Yikes.   I'm of two minds about this. On the one hand, some customers will enjoy the TV volatility on display.  People drawn to the restaurant because of its owner's short fuse might relish in the aggressive outburst. I mean, it's Vegas. People want to see a show, right? On the other hand, that kind of energy-sucking behavior is confusing and off-putting for others.  Put me squarely in the \"off-putting\" camp. I cannot believe how aggressively and loudly the chef went at his employees. If it had not gone on, I would have assumed it was a customer or that I had misheard. But he didn't care if we heard. And I think that's my issue. Not only was it unprofessional, but it unnerved me a and put and let me on edge at the end of my meal. And no one seemed to care about the effect of the outburst on guests. There are establishments where rough language and behavior are expected and even appreciated. A high-end burGR joint in a casino on the strip isn't one. If Chef was yelling in the back somewhere out of earshot, no one would be the wiser. Heck, if he had shouted a few curse words, only a few patrons at the counter would have known. But to draw an entire section of the restaurant into his tantrum was too much.    THE REST  THE OUTFITS: Why do the male servers wear loose jeans and loose gray tops while the women wear skin-tight (read 'two-sizes too small'), short (read 'I almost saw her lady business') chest baring outfits? Before a barrage of foul language disputed my meal, I was blown away at the attire in this establishment. I don't think you have to be a feminist to be offended at the objectification of the women who serve food at BurGR. I saw each lady tug at the front of her dress no less than two times. It's ridiculous.  I know sex (or the promise of it) is driving the wardrobe decisions here, but loosening the dresses one size and lengthening them 2 inches might allow the ladies to still look sexy (God forbid they don't) without worrying about flashing the restaurant.  Unlike the hostesses (whose outfits were slightly looser), the servers have to bend and pull and lean and stretch. Their job requires constant movement. Why can't they wear \"sexy\" clothing that accommodates that?   THE WAIT: Sigh, it's not shocking to wait to be seated at a restaurant on the strip. We waited to be seated. We waited to see a server. We waited for our refills. We asked for refills and waited some more. Just be ready to wait at BurGR.  We didn't see one customer getting a refill on any beverage. After asking a second time for a refill, the busboy (also in an unnecessarily tight top) brought over new glasses. He set them down and then collected the original glasses. We laughed because they obviously don't expect to refill drinks at BurGR. In fairness, it was a busy night. But on the flip side, it was a busy night---be ready to serve water to your patrons.  I wonder if Chef was yelling about that.  THE SERVICE: The staff was helpful and kind.   THE FOOD: The truffle fries were warmish (was that it Chef?) and flavorful. Many places in town do a variation on this theme and none of them have been that impressive to me. My Euro burger was flavorful and was cooked perfectly. I appreciate the quality buttered and toasted bun as well. Hubby LOVED the Farm burger. And after tasting it, I had to agree that it was the standout.  OVERALL: This was a three and a half star review before the outburst. I didn't taste (or experience) anything that would entice me to hop in my car, drive around for a spot, walk through the maze that is Planet Hollywood, and wait for an inordinate amount of time for a table in a hamburger joint. BurGR is not for me.  BUT, this is a great spot for tourists. It is located in a convenient area near Las Vegas BLVD, so those walking around can stop in easily and have a bite. It's easy to access and the food is good. And what does a tourist care about a wait or obscene language or an impractically tight dress? This is VEGAS. What I see as problems would very likely bring tourists back time and time again."}
{"text":"Love this place. We are local and my family and I go almost once a week. The burgers are amazing and the truffle fries with that amazing truffle aioli sauce are to die for. We went last night again and the only complaint I have is about the jalapeno poppers they serve. Don't get me wrong they are delicious, but I would have to say that the amount of times we have eaten there at least 50% of the time they are still cold inside. We told the waiter there last night and he was awesome and got us a new batch that were nice and hot (heat hot). It would be nice if this was addressed. To me if they are cold even after frying they must be frozen when cooked. Maybe you can make sure they are more thawed out before frying them.  Again this place is awesome and besides that there are NO complaints...besides the poppers being cold in the middle."}
{"text":"Best Burger Ever!  We split two burgers, the Euro Burger and Chanterelle Burger and an order of Truffle Parmesan fries.  All the food was done perfectly.  The beer was cold, the wait time for seating was minutes and the wait time to get the food was reasonable.  Maybe we got lucky but we loved this place.   We felt the Euro Burger was the best we've ever had.  And the fries were AMAZING!  Expensive?  Yes.  Worth it?  We thought so."}
{"text":"Went back again on my recent visit to Vegas and tried the fish sandwich. It was giant! Also topped with salt and vinegar chip shreds. It was messy to eat, but very scrumptious. Had to get the truffle fries again of course! Can't remember when the others in my party had but they enjoyed their meal as well!"}
{"text":"Great BurGR at a moderate price. For starters, there was a pretty long line but they have an \"up with the times\" way of taking your reso-they just text you. We only waited about 30 minutes so not too shabby considering the length of the line. We had the Honey-Pig Bao Buns to start which were amazing considering you like pork belly. I also had the Farmer Burger which would've been perfect if the fried egg on top had the delicious runny yolk you would expect once you bite into it. Mine was basically an over-hard egg. In most cases I would've sent it back but I was too hungry to part with it. Other than that it was cooked perfectly and tasted great. The sweet potato fries were heavenly once dipped in the sauce provided. I will definitely be back to try another burger and a milkshake next time. The only other critique I have other than my pathetically fried egg is the service. Our server was friendly, cute, always kept our drinks full. She was not the problem. However the hostess stand could use some training in customer service. There are about 4-5 girls standing up there doing absolutely nothing. Because of the set up and how busy it typically is, it can be a bit confusing whether to go up to the hostess stand or get in line with the others. Typically there are tourists standing around with a confused look on their face and I did not see even one of the five hostess offer them any help. I still recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located at PH. The wait usually is around 20-30 minutes but well worth it. The staff is real nice and well informed. What else would you expect from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant at any minute he can come out and make you regret not studying the menu. The food is real good and fairly reasonable priced for a LV restaurant. I come eat here every time we visit LV so yes Gordon if you're reading this, \"I'll be back\"."}
{"text":"I just have to say how very disappointed I was with BurGR. Even more so because of what I went through to get there. My mother absolutely loves Gordon Ramsey and has always wanted to eat at one of his restaurants. We haven't much money at all and so I actually had to save each month for 8 months just to travel to Las Vegas, stay in a hole in the wall hotel for two nights and take her for dinner at his BurGR restaurant. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and she the Farm burger. My hamburger patty was BEYOND burnt and the bun fell apart. I was going to tell the waitress but she never once checked on us and instead of ruining my mom's most anticipated day, I simply stopped eating. I was devastated that I spent everything I had to take her, and was undoubtedly let down."}
{"text":"What can I say? Gordon Ramsay moves burgers into the big league...  Check out the fries... AMPLE serving to share for 2"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey könnte mir nicht weiter am Popo vorbeigehen, aber abgesehen von GRs Name und Logo überall: Verdammt leckere Burger! Perfekt medium, echte Tomaten, super Soßen und schweres Besteck.  Super Service noch dazu. Preislich etwas gehoben, aber ist halt Vegas :)  Einziger Negativpunkt? Man hat immer das Gefühl, dass die einen schnell für den nächsten Kunden draußen haben wollen."}
{"text":"Food was not bad but the atmosphere was not for me. It was too noisy and server cannot even get our orders right. Maybe he did not hear us!"}
{"text":"We are fans of Gordon Ramsey but this place is disappointing from the get go. I understand the long wait in Vegas specially the Christmas weekend but seriously 90 minutes? Also had to wait for the food at least 45 more minutes after ordering. The server was polite and friendly. She did forget the fries. The burger patties were thick and tasted average. The hotdog was oversized looked good but not tasty. Fries were average too. Nothing really to \"write home about\". Gordon Ramsey you have been CHOPPED!"}
{"text":"I had concerns about the place, because I don't like celebrities' hype. But the food convinced me. I had the mangalitsa and I had a great dinner as a Hungarian (mangalitsa is a Hungarian breed). The staff was very kind and professional. My first beer was very bad, I don't remember its name, it isn't worth to do so, but it was an English ale or something like that. But my second one , Fat Tyre, was excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered take out because I was tired. Took 45 minutes, food was cold and they forgot the drink. The reception desk was too busy socializing with each other to check with order until I asked. The only people hustling were the wait staff. Can't evaluate cold food. Get your act together people. This is Vegas."}
{"text":"The loaded fries were amazing! Gouda cheese and salami!  I tried the Farm burger that had duck bacon- full of flavor.  Also tried the Hell's Kitchen burger- avocado, roasted jalapeño, delicious!  Also had the light lemonade cocktail which was refreshing and not too sweet.  5 stars were due to the customer service. We were seated promptly, our server came out right away, and I was pleasantly surprised by a gourmet peanut butter push pop!"}
{"text":"I recently ate at Gordon Ramsey Burgr @ Planet Hollywood and thought I should write a review.  As a fan, I had recently eaten at GR Steak, which was an amazing experience, but again as a fan I felt compelled to eat at burgr and probably shouldn't have, leaving my GR food experience as super positive.  Burgr is ok, the food is good enough and its cheap.  But given that Ramsey's name is on it you expect a certain level of quality and its not there and honestly I'm pretty forgiving.  I know line chef's and serving staff work very hard and things happen but I again because Gordon Ramsey associated his name to it I expected a base level of quality.  My burger was ok, undercooked but ok and I enjoyed it honestly but I should have eaten at holstein's in the Cosmopolitan which is a lot better in my estimation.    The burger was undercooked.  I had ordered medium rare but what I got was really rare. Despite being super rare it was good enough to eat and not return.  The burger was also pretty bland, I expected a bit more flavor.  The fries were overpowering - a lot of Parmesan which got all over everything and overpowered the fries and everything else.  But surprisingly I will say the ketchup was really good! It was also good presentation, I'll give it that.  But honestly I don't think I'll go back and wont be recommending it to anyone.  Its cheap and looks neat but if I want to pay for a premium burger I'll go to holstein's as I've had very good luck there.    Maybe it was a bad day I'm not sure but as I said I was less then impressed. I wanted to give it more stars I did...but it just wasn't there."}
{"text":"So...my first lunch experience here was rather underwhelming. I had such high hopes for their Blue Burger, but it ended up rather dry (I had it cooked medium). Their Roasted Jalapeño Poppers were rather tasty though. I personally don't think it's worth the 45 minute wait, but fortunately you're able to leave your name and number with them and they will text you when your table is ready (I believe if you're in a party of 4+). I am open to trying them out a second time, but with so many other eateries to try out, it's honestly not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"How can this be four stars, four stars of disappointment is more like it. The wait was not that long. From getting inline to sitting down it was only a thirty minute wait. The staff was attentive and pleasant. With high hopes I went for the Farm Burger, duck bacon sounded amazing, and as always I ordered it medium.  My girl friend was going ordered the same Farm Burger, due to the deliciousness sounding of duck bacon. Usually she orders her burgers rare, because restaurants usually mess up and it comes out medium rare. But, because this is Gordon Ramsay BurGR they should know how to cook meat. So she actually ordered it medium rare. The one of the good things we had were the truffle fries. They were amazing, the sauces that came with them were just ok. Overall, atmosphere is great and the staff is attentive. I feel that the burgers are just overhyped."}
{"text":"Big TGIFriday's vibe (but hey it's Vegas), delicious burgers and milk shakes, but the long wait may not be worth it.  Maybe some video poker for the wait."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd visit and the food is great.   Jalapeño poppers are awesome.   My rating would be 5 stars if they would correct the way they do the waiting list.    They have a way to text you when the table is ready, which is great.   The wait was around 45 minutes.   We received a text saying our table is ready, only to go to the counter and have them tell use they are still setting up our table.   We waited 20 more minutes along with around 5 other groups that were texted.   Please do not text unless the table is really ready.   Fix that problem for 5 stars."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in my two burgers which was the Ramsey burger and the number one burger, the hella kitchen burger. The ingredients were tasty but the meat itself was just plain. The meat had very little taste. We also had the fries which was not crunchy and also disappointed. Lastly the Oreo shake was good which I recommend."}
{"text":"I had such high expectations but was let down. The hamburger was small, plain, dry, lukewarm and overcooked. I asked for medium and it came out medium well. What I couldn't understand was why would they serve such a plain burger. It was a piece of dry meat with unmelted cheese slapped on two dry buns. No mayo, ketchup...nothing! When I asked why they didn't bring any condiments, she acted surprised that I would ask for such a thing and got defensive. To make it worse, this waitress was unfriendly from the start. She never smiled and at one point bumped my chair while walking behind me without saying excuse me. The other servers I noticed also seemed unfriendly and didn't smile. Not my kind of atmosphere. The \"just fries\" weren't good and were extremely dry, lacking any good seasoning. All I can say is that In & Out burgers are at least nice and juicy with melted cheese and for far less money with great service! This place lacks that. I would've expected that from Ramsay who gets on restaurants' cases for this kind of things. Big fail Ramsay!a"}
{"text":"I've never been to any of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, but I've seen enough of him on television to have high expectations for his food. Even entering the meal with this bias, I was blown away.   My boyfriend and I weren't really hungry, but we ordered the roasted jalapeno poppers, split the Hell's Kitchen burger, and had the shake #5 (chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake + praline cookie).  The jalapeno poppers were perfect. Warm gooey, spicy center and a perfectly crispy shell each dipped in their own shot glass of sauce. Eat them all as soon as they come out because we saved a few for the end and they weren't as great.   The shake was phenomenal - probably the best shake I've ever had. The idea of pudding on top of a shake is pure genius. We used the small spoon to eat the pudding then add in a few sips from the shake, and a bite of the cookie and you're in heaven. It's a pretty hefty portion and perfect for sharing.  The burger was equally excellent - perfectly cooked, juicy, and seasoned just right. The jalapenos were actually spicy - none of that wimpy mess you get at other places.  Overall, I was impressed and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food is Awesome here!!! Line was so longggg but if you have more than 3 party, check in at the front desk and receive a text message within 30 - 40min. Then we can go play in the casino till second message. Staffs were nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"ok, so my review is not about food. i was just uncomfortable throughout the whole meal and don't remember how the burger tasted. we were seated right under air conditioner with cold air blowing down my back, i asked to switch tables and was put under another air conditioner. the waiter avoided eye contact with me and it was like i did something horrible by asking to be seated at another table. they need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"THE ONION RINGS. Those alone are like a religious experience.   I 100000% recommend getting The onion rings. Top tier.  The burger was so good. I got the chicken one, I don't remember what it's called. But it was really good.   The \"Ruby's kiss\" was a really good alcoholic beverage. My friends also got the Caribbean dream and the Whiskey cherry lemonade. The Caribbean was very pineapple and the whiskey cherry is VERY sweet.   We also got fries, and the curry ketchup is SO GOOD.  But if you're gonna get anything, get the onion rings.   The coffee pudding shake!!!!!! All of it is so good. Just. Yes. Get this."}
{"text":"Dear Gordon Ramsay, You have a trained staff that is efficient, polite, and attentive...including when the mains were served before we ate 1/4 of our starters (and a very chagrined waitress apologized and scuffled the trainee/helper away)... You have modern, smart decor in a bustling casino... You do NOT, however, have an amazing burger. For a restaurant bearing the name of the signature dish like a medal, you would think that the burgers would be something of dreams.  Lacking moisture, the burgers we tried were just \"okay\"...the truffle fries needed salt...and the starters like the pork buns lacked flavor, as if an ingredient or two was missing. Gordon, Gordon, Gordon...we wanted to be pleased with your presentation of one of the simplest foods elevated to your standards!  Don't think we will be back to see if we just went on an \"off day\" for your chefs. Sigh, Us"}
{"text":"Such a let down! The hells burger was good but not nearly as good as Holsteins. Pricey but onion rings were good and sweet potato fries....other than that meh..."}
{"text":"Looking at the previous reviews and the wait to get in I really thought I was in for an amazing experience. However, the experience was truly disappointing. I was sitting at Extra Lounge enjoying cocktails and live music and thought I would order a burger to go since I was literally next door. The hostess kindly took my order and I paid for it and was told they would text me when it was ready. I waited about 20 minutes and then finally received my message. It took one minute for me to see the text and go back to the restaurant. When I picked it up the boxes were bagged to go, no utensils or napkins. I then requested the items and the hosted grabbed them. It took me less than a minute to get back to my seating. When my friend and I opened our to go boxes, both burgers (the farm and uber) looked like they had been sitting out and they looked like pre-frozen shaped patties. He had his protein style and mine was medium rare with the bun.  I took a couple of bites and was expecting some incredible flavor bursts but was let down. Both burgers  were bland with no seasoning and I realized then they left off the bacon I requested. I proceeded to take my burger back and reported to the hostess that the burger was cold and the bacon was missing. The manager came over and promptly apologized and removed the cost from my bill. Giving me a deer and head lights look she tried to convince me to try dining with them again. It was the least genuine attempt I've seen.  I worked in the restaurant industry long enough that I can tell when food has been sitting. This burger, although ordered as medium rare, should have been warm on the outside. There wasn't any hint that it was even cooked on an open flame and I couldn't even distinguish the cheeses. Mind you I eat rib eye steak or ground beef (raw, rare, or medium rare) almost every day and I can smell and distinguish flavors very easily.    Overall, this is overhyped and doesn't deliver. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I actually want to give this place a 4.5stars.   The flavor combinations of each dish was excellent and some very unique, utilizing truffle oil, chanterelle mushrooms and also having dishes from different kinds ethnic influence was all amazing and exciting.  One word, the menu was well thought out in many different aspects.    The restaurant management was also very professionally systemized. The wait time was on point, the order of operations and training of employees were all splendid. Along with creativity of the restaurant decor (including the menu and the big fire grill) and the ambience was all fantastic and clever as well.  Everything was great! Except that the two burgers we ordered both could have been juicier. Hearing Gordon Ramsay's name somehow made me expect perhaps one of the juiciest burger I would taste. The burgers really could have been juicier..."}
{"text":"I read the reviews & I wasn't disappointed! The burgers are great! Actually the service, burgers & fries were all great. We had the farm burger which was so moist & delicious. I was concerned the duck bacon might be too rich but it definitely wasn't. The egg topped it off & it wasjust so so good! The Gordon burger is similar to the hog burger & it was good but a little dry. Nothing the homemade ketchup couldn't fix tho.The fries were real cut potatoes & were just great too. All in all...highly recommended & much better than Holsteins at the Cosmo!"}
{"text":"Hit Burgr last Friday with the gf, my daughter and her bf.  Post Terry Fator meal so it was about 9:30 - 10 pm.    They were busy but no wait.  Kinda confusing getting to the place - the entrance does not face towards the casino.  Stylish looking restaurant.  Also, props for the hipster looking outfits of the staff -  skin tight skirts with sneakers, nice.  Sorry - can't remember the foo-foo drinks we started with but they were good - i liked that the hipster ipad drink menu had nice drink pics and when you clicked the drink it listed the ingredients  Food order:  Beer batter Maui Onion rings ($8 - all prices the discounted \"total rewards\") Roasted Chili Dawg ($12) Hells' Kitchen Burger ($13) Britannia Burger ( $13) Farm Burger ($14) Euro Burger ($15)  Truffle Parmesan Fries ($10) Sweet Potato Fries ( $8) Carmel Pudding Chocolate Shake ($8)  Highlights:  The white cheddar ranch dip with the onion rings was fantastic  The Roasted Chili Dawg was a flavor explosion The actual burger meat was amazing - it was a 3 meat mix  - nice char, perfectly pink in the middle, juicy and full of flavor ( could've used a little more salt but minor issue )  The duck breast bacon - a first for all of us - pleasant surprise Sweet potato Fries - perfectly cooked, nice seasoning The caramel pudding in the shake - incredible !!  Lows ( all minor issues )   The onion rings could be crispier more cheese on the burgers !!! generally speaking, the burger ingredient combinations - PLEASE ADD A BUILD YOUR OWN BURGER OPTION  The service was punctual - a slight annoyance of trying to constantly clean the tables while we were still eating.  Added bonus is they accepted a food coupon i had fro Caesar's - helped given the prices are a little steep.  We will return !!  Pics previously added"}
{"text":"my son took me here for my bday:-) the burger I got was very tasty and good. definitely will come back. service was great:-)"}
{"text":"Best. Burger. Ever.   I know I claimed that at Sketch Burger in Philadelphia, but I really mean it with this place. Just a heads up they are a bit difficult to find since they are right next to a casino. But once you find it you'll know by the wall of fire that is on display in front of the restaurant.   We got there for dinner and left our names and they just called us when our table was ready (group of about 8); otherwise you'd have to wait in line if you have a small party. So we just chilled around the casino for about 45 minutes to kill time before dinner.  Once we got seated we started ordering appetizer and you guessed it, burgers. The appetizers were bomb and we got a bunch of types of fries and onion rings. Not only were they delicious in it of themselves, but the sauces they came with were AMAZING. Now we get to the burgers...the juiciest and most tender burgers I have ever eaten. Seriously, we all got different ones but no one had absolutely any complaints about their burgers!!! I really wish I could've gone back again for round 2 but unfortunately there was no time :(   Fun Fact: they let you keep the menus as souvenirs! Pleasant treat :)"}
{"text":"Gordon is lucky I'm giving the second star and it's mostly for the fries (I really liked them). But this place (along with MANY others) have fallen in to the \"we don't give a damn about vegetarians so give them a portobello\".   That's pretty sad considering they charge $12 for it.   It tasted lame and was very rubbery. I've made better at home on a cast iron skillet on my lunch hour.   If you are a veg this is your ONE option and that is pitiful.   Gordon, you can do better."}
{"text":"The Hell's Kitchen lettuce wrap was an amazing gluten free burger.  The French fries could have been better.  They were kind of soggy and grainy.  The dipping sauces for the fries were strange.  I didn't really like either of them."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. The food is overpriced and not all that. In n out has better burgers. You're obviously paying for the name. The Oreo brûlée shake is amazing though. I would go back there for the shake only. The burger was dry and the fries were no bueno!"}
{"text":"Had higher expectations based on Yelp reviews. The food was decent at best. There were 6 girls at the reception desk and not one greeted the customers. The tables were dirty. Our server was nice. Surprised Chef Ramsey has his name attached here!"}
{"text":"Nicely done.  We had the American Burger, which is a great rendition of a classic and the Hog Burger, which is simply a tremendous innovation.  Staff was excellent and food as well.   Maui Onion Rings a great side, but the burgers were so hearty we couldn't finish them.   House made ketchup great."}
{"text":"Good burger here, though not the best I've ever had. Not too bad of prices for being located on the strip too.  Just know that the wait is most likely not worth it and the burgers don't come with fries."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Gordon Ramsey fan and finally got to eat at one of his restaurants in Las Vegas, Burgr Bar. We went around 3pm which was perfect because the wait was only about 15 minutes. During lunch and dinner expect to wait at least an hour. I personally loved the atmosphere and the food is awesome!  Seriously, how can a hot dog be that good?!  The burgers were just the right size and juicy. The flavor of all the food was awesome!  The beer battered onion rings were a delicious start to our meal. The Parmesan and Sweet Potato Fries are a great pair for the burgers.  I can't wait until I go back to Vegas next year so I can try one of his other restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers...farm burger is perfection and they bake all the bread fresh daily....a great meal from start to finish...fries and onion rings and the dipping sauces were so yummy...not greasy and heavy like some fried foods...cutomer service is key and our waiter was the sweetest...explained everything and gave great recommendations. He let me keep the menu as a souvenir! And finally...the creme brulee milkshake...brilliant!...definitely in my top three favorite burger places in Vegas."}
{"text":"We were there last night our fries were cold and hard after 25 minutes waiting for our food. I ordered farm burger my hubby ordered hog burger both burgers were ok. Our waiter was nice kept apologizing for delay. I was very disappointed with this having Gordon Ramsay name on it . We  won't be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious and juicy turkey burger and poppers! Would definitely return. Text system for RSVP."}
{"text":"I thought the burger was better then decent. I had the Hells Fire burger.  Cooked right. Truffle fries were outstanding and I could of made a meal of those.  I sat at the bar and the service was meh. Probably one of the more affordable joints on the strip but still not cheap.  Not a great wine list (white) lots of good stuff on tap."}
{"text":"WOWZIE DOWZIE!!! Yum yum go get you some! This place is delish. The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is because it was super loud, but hey man you're on the strip- what do you expect right? So we started with the jalapeno poppers. They are served in shot glasses of ranch and a drizzle of a hot pepper sauce. So. Damn. Good. Perfect presentation also- no double dipping, and no man handling of the apps to find the perfect popper. My sister had the spicy hot dog. I think they might case the sausages actually in house. Best quality hot dog I have ever tasted. I had the house burger that came with fire roasted tomato, queso fresco, and chiles. The meat was perfect. The toppings on my burger reminded me of a chile relleno. Our server was awesome- quick& cheerful. We were with a big group so we ordered the parmesan oinion rings, truffle fries, natural fries, and sweet potato fries. They were all stellar. They serve them all with housemade sauces, and the sweet potato fries have a tiny shaker of powdered sugar. I read another review that was complaining about no reservations? We did have reservations, and they took us right on time :) Gordon Ramsey seems kinda douchey on TV, but his BurGR restaurant is freaking GREAT. Love it :) YUM YUM YUM"}
{"text":"I love Gordon Ramsay.  Coming to this restaurant was a highlight of my recent Vegas trip. Service was top notch, my server even paired a beer with my burger for me (kudos).  The burgers could have been more tasty considering this is Gordon Ramsay's creation, but they were good burgers.  I loved that they texted us when our table was ready, so we were able to walk around for the hour wait.  Also, we sat on the counter top (by choice) - I recommend it! It was really fun watching the kitchen operate :)"}
{"text":"During our most recent Vegas trip my husband and I returned to Gordon Ramsay BurGRs. I remember this place having one of the most delicious burgers I have ever eaten. This time unfortunately, it was just a good burger. I did not find anything amazing about my burger during this visit. Luckily, we did not have a long wait, as I know the line to get into this restaurant alone can be a deterrent. We were actually seated right away with a party size of 4. My husband and friends all ordered the farm burger and I ordered the Hell's kitchen burger per the recommendation of our server.   Farm Burger = duck breast bacon + english sharp cheddar + fried egg Hell's Kitchen Burger = asadero cheese + roasted jalapeños + avocado + oven roasted tomatoes + jalapeños pesto aioli   Both burgers above were recommended to us by our server as she mentioned they were among the most popular ordered by guests. They were accommodating and brought out the jalapeños on the side for me, since I wanted a more mild taste. I did enjoy both, but if I had to pick, I prefer the Farm burger to the Hell's Kitchen burger.  Two disappointing things were: 1) Our friends burgers were not cooked medium rare as requested 2) The wait to receive our food... I believe we waited well over 30 minutes until our burgers and fries were served. For the price we paid for our drinks burgers and fries I just expected more..Unfortunately, our second trip to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR was not as satisfying as our first.   Overall, a good burger place.. but I will skip out on visiting this restaurant again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant the 3rd day after their grand opening. Don't waste your time or money.  First we waited 25 minutes to get seated and we were first in line and restaurant was fairly empty.  The staff is super friendly, helpful and great.  The service is extremely slow. From the time they took our order to the moment our food landed on our table was a good 50 minutes. We almost left.  The food is not good. We ordered burgers. They are tiny, the bread is not so good either. Mi ordered a vegetarian burger, which is portobello mushroom, awful. I get the same burger at Cheesecake Factory and it tastes awesome.  The burgers don't come with fried so we had to order fries separately which was $11 per order. 4 burgers and two fries cost us about $120.  I wouldnot go back again. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was pretty happy with my food. It was my first time there and I was with my family because they were staying at that casino. Whish I could of saw Gordon lol"}
{"text":"We entered the line at 10:55, which proceeded to triple in length by 11am.  The entry fire feature was a delight for the deep seceded pyro in me.  It drives the anticipation of a delicious burger grilled over an open flame.  Once seated, the interior is dark with highlights of a flame motif.  The chairs, however, were fit for a person that is vertically challenged as my knees were to my chest.  That might be a little dramatic but this serves the purpose.    The Parmesan fries arrived with the Gordon burger and farm burger in tow.  The fries were delicious with a powerful Parmesan note.  The ketchup was interesting and the truffle aioli was not a favorite.  The farm burger was phenomenal with the salty flavor coming from the duck bacon and creaminess of the egg.  It packs a hefty punch for the food deprived.  The Gordon burger was good with the same duck bacon.  The added avocado and roasted peppers added a nice complexity.    Overall the meal was good but I had expected just a touch more.  I had to add a extra half star for the fire feature and the raspberry tea!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal!!! I've heard about this place and always wanted to come to one of Chef  Ramsey's restaurants.  The hostess and waitress were very nice and friendly. Only took 10 mins to seat us. Place was clean. I ordered the American Burger with cheddar cheese, butter lettuce, and tomato.  The bun was toasted just right and the steak fries tasty. I would come back the next time I'm in Vegas!! The manager stopped by to check and see how our meal was."}
{"text":"This was by far the best burger I've ever had. It was worth the short wait, the money and the calories! I'm not one to crave burgers by any means but this would make me come back again and again. We started with the gooey fries which are topped with two types of cheeses, salami and a fried egg. It was so rich, creamy and a big portion so I wouldn't plan on ordering fries or onion rings with the burger. I had the farm burger which was a perfectly cooked burger topped with duck breast bacon, cheese, and a fried egg. I'm definitely coming back here every time I visit Vegas now."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Gordon Ramsay BurGR Las Vegas and they knocked it out of the park! Delicious burgers, good, fast servers, and we'd definitely come here again!   WHY YOU SHOULD EAT HERE It was a perfect choice for our late night post-show eats - from traditional to unique burger preparations, they use top-notch ingredients. Beef patties are cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods, which creates delicious flavors. For my vegetarian friends, they offer a portobello mushroom burger. They also offer great sides (like sweet potato fries and crazy good onion rings) and my new personal favorite discovery must-have was the PUDDING SHAKE! Go, check it out, and thank me later! Located inside Planet Hollywood - we took a cab over specifically to come here.   They are OPEN LATE - we got there about 11:00 pm and left about 12:30 am. Great for POST-SHOW EATS!  BURGERS ARE ABOUT $15 EACH - DELICIOUS, AFFORDABLE COMFORT FOOD IN VEGAS!  WHAT WE ORDERED:  THE HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER - My husband ordered this and said it's one of the best burger's he's had. HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT IT! The yummy details: asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, oven roasted tomatoes, and jalapeno pesto aioli.  THE FARM BURGER - my choice!  The yummy details: duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar cheese, and a fried egg. I totally enjoyed it - high-end comfort food. I would definitely get this again! NOTE: The egg on this burger is a runny egg, but our server told me about this beforehand, and I love eggs, so the runny egg so I did not mind at all - IT WAS GOOOOD! ;) Get this if you like fried, runny eggs. COMFORT FOOD AT ITS FINEST.   ONION RINGS - Super delicious, with two dipping sauces - a SPICY KETCHUP and the other was like a creamy ranch. Onion rings were cooked perfectly and combined with the sauces, it was a medley of delicious Mmmmmmm IN OUR MOUTHS!   DRINK - THE CREME BRULEE PUDDING SHAKE PUT YOURSELF IN SHAKE MOUTHGASM AND ORDER THIS!  Do not even hesitate. If you like milkshakes and puddings, this is a MUST! I am still daydreaming about this. I ordered the creme brulee oreo pudding shake - a combination of thick shake and silky pudding. There are other shake flavors, too, but this one had my name all over it. It's out of this world! Pudding shake is $9 and worth every penny.   SERVICE  Our server was JERED and he was great, checked up on us, gave suggestions when we asked, knew about the menu, and he brought our food over fast. Jered was excellent. The water staff refilled our glasses regularly - he was great, too!  WAIT TIME  There is a line out the door when you get there. I read about this beforehand. We requested a BOOTH, ended up getting a half booth, which was fine since it was the two of us. We waited about 10-15 minutes after we arrived around 11:00 pm on a Saturday night, with about eight people waiting in front of us. Not bad and the seating hostesses did their job well.   COST: $51.91 which includes tax for two delicious burgers ($15 each), onion rings ($9) , and a pudding shake ($9).  We thought this was acceptable for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Vegas.   END RESULT: MOUTH-TUMMIES-HAPPY and we would definitely come here again! If you like burgers, do yourself a favor and check this place out!   This review is for our late-night visit 4/23/16, leaving 4/24/16 around 12:30 am.  GORDON AND STAFF, YOU DID GOOOOOOOD!"}
{"text":"My husband , daughter and I eat out ALLOT , my husband being in the food industry ( an executive chef) , I have eaten at high end and lower end food place's , I know what to expect from both the server's and food ( also having been a server as well ).  That being said , here are the good comment's first..  1. The wait was not that long for lunch. ( if you are going for dinner , go about an hour before you want to eat , the lines get VERY long ).  2. The food was good , out of 10 star's , 10 being the best and 0 being the worst , I would give the food an 9.  3. The price for a burger was not that expensive.  4. The actual hamburger's were VERY good size's , They DID NOT cut corner's on that.   Now for the negative.  1. VERY loud . Both the music and atmosphere , I had to yell to talk to my server and family.   2. Drink order's took a while 7 minute's , my 10 year old ordered a shake , that took 15 minute's.  3.Our server has NO personality , and seemed VERY unhappy , and only checked on us once in the hour we where there. I also noticed the other server's looked unhappy and like robot's as well. NO ONE SMILED ONCE.  4. I ordered a burger ( no meat ) , and they forgot the cheese. I would of thought , they would of taken at least a few dollars off , since there was no meat ... BUT NO.  5.When it was time for the check , I had money in front of me ( not even in the black money holder yet ) , our server came up and just took the money and said .. Are you ready to pay and took the money. I thought that to be VERY rude.  6. Both the orange place mat's and table hadstuff on them , and the knife had huge water spot's on it. ( like the dish washer was not working right ).  Both my husband and I are HUGE Chef Ramsey fan's , and could not WAIT to go.  Over all , I don't think we will be going back. I expected MORE out of a restaurant with Chef Gordon Ramsey's name on it.  Out of 10 star's , again 10 being the best and 0 being the worst ,I would rate our verall experience a 4.   You can have great food , BUT if the service is bad , that just ruin's it for me.  Also NOT a place to bring children."}
{"text":"BurGR is everything we hoped it would be and more. The service was great and the food was excellent. The onion Rings and 2 dipping sauces we the best."}
{"text":"It's not terrible. It's also nothing special. Perhaps when you live here, you loose the awe most seem to find in celebrities.  BurGR suffers from the same maladies as all the other $50 burger joints on The Strip do. Very slow, very expensive, overworked and (I'm sure) poorly paid staff.  The menu has some interesting variations on the theme and surely one of them will be to your taste, but we've found nothing so positive that it justifies putting up with the negatives.  This is just another celebrity carpet-bagger here to suck some more $$ while the gray train is still running. It's really a shame because Las Vegas is the place where it can be done right."}
{"text":"It's better than Red Robins at least...  Food is underwhelming in flavor and creativity.   The Gordon Ramsey brand could learn a lot from much better burger places from the PNW such as; Quinn's, 8oz Burger, and Biwa.  Supposedly they reinvented the milkshake too... Into that jello pudding you buy from the grocery.    Also... The French fries were chewy.  iPads with a terrible web-based application used as a drink menu offer a very awkward experience.   If you're a foodie... This is not a place for you."}
{"text":"Great place! There is always a line to wait in, but if only 2 people in your party it goes very fast...20 minutes tops. If more than 2 then be prepared for 45 minutes to hour wait. We sit at the bar and had outstanding service. Was quick and attentive and outfits waiter and waitresses wear are HOT! Ordered the jalapeño poppers and was definitely impressed. 6 in and order and each is in an individual shot glass. Popper is cooked well and nice sauce served with them. Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was great, but shared with husband and one half of it was so hot it was impossible to eat - spicy hot. Other half was terrific so I don't know if just had very hot pepper or what. Fries are great and you get two styles of ketchup with order. Loved the chipotle one...the curry was different but enjoyable. Very nice place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good burger and onion rings. My Husband loved his jalapeño Marg and fancy wings. I'm glad we went so we can say we did. I don't know that I would go again."}
{"text":"Farmer burger is the bomb, get the meat done medium as its more juicy! I'd come again!"}
{"text":"I honestly expected more from Gordon Ramsay Burger. The Ahi Sliders is on the menu and they don't make them anymore, according to the waitress they have a new menu.... so why are you passing out the old menu?  I ordered a turkey burger, it did not taste good, I only ate half of it, because I was hungry.  It seemed a little under cook. The sweet potato fries were blah, not impressed with the sauces.    My husband had the backyard burger with regular fries. He's rating it as average, nothing impressive.   Overall, disappointed!!  As we were leaving, the table next to me got their food, one of the orders was the Ahi sliders. I did speak to the Manager, she was very nice and apologized. Offered to invite us back complimentary, we said no."}
{"text":"Was really great. Our waitress was very attentive and helpful. We had the farmhouse and hells kitchen burgers. We loved both. The gooey fries were the BOMB!!! I def. Recommend them. We each had a drink as well, which were also both very good. Reasonably priced for the strip, and very good burgers. We were not disapointed!"}
{"text":"While in Vegas I wanted to hit up one of Ramseys restaurants, so we dropped in to Burgr for lunch. There was a short wait, but we were seated pretty quickly. Our waiter was a great guy and knew the menu well. My only issue with this whole experience was I felt like my table was way too high for my chair, but what ever, the Food was great, the truffle fries are a must try, we shared a serving and it was plenty. The burgers are damn good, and the raspberry lemonade is slightly addictive. We had such a great experience while here I would love to return and try more of the menu options."}
{"text":"\"Can a three-Michelin awarded celebrity chef, a generally angry Scottish/English guy and successful psychopath, pull off the great American classic?\" What a world we live in that we have to ask ourselves that kind of question. BurGR is, however, an attempt to give us an answer.  The verdict? Nah, not completely.  BurGR is situated near one of the Planet Hollywood's entrances that face the Strip. You're greeted by giant arcs of unnecessary pyrotechnics as you wait in line, with Ramsay's scowling face and merchandise staring back at you as you mingle amongst the other people that are interested in the same question you are. Peeking into the restaurant, you can catch glimpses of the wait staff-- dressed like they're in an upscale Hooters-- and the open kitchen with guys working the line like they're still hoping to make it big someday.   And you know what? Sometimes, the dress does make the person. Or something. Because on my visit the floor staff was unbelievably lackadaisical, riding the coattails of the restaurant's name cause there's a bunch of suckers, including me, lined up wanting in There was no urgency anywhere... except, interestingly, by the background crew: the chefs. Only until I got a seat near the open kitchen, already berating myself for waiting a full hour just to get a burger at this place, that it became clear to me that there was a definite disconnect between the folks in the kitchen and the kids waiting the tables. The kitchen is a picture of efficiency-- guys have their heads down, calling out orders, making sure shit is right. Their movements are careful, but there's urgency-- they want to get you your food ASAP before the orders start stacking up. Just as any good restaurant should be.  Then you have the wait staff. I really don't know what BurGR is aiming to be, but there needs to be better training somewhere. I was literally served by the sous chef working that day (it's written on his name-tag) simply because he kept calling for \"hands\" and no one would get the goddamn order out of the kitchen. \"But HC, the staff must be swamped! Cut them some slack!\" If they were, I wasn't seeing it. I saw wait staff flirting back and forth with each other in that kind of creepy incestual way. I saw a lot of unfilled waters. I saw a lot of food waiting on the line for longer than they probably should have been there. Are any of you folks that ate here wondering why your food was lukewarm/cold? Uh, that's probably why. Granted I'm not a professional at this shit but I do know that if the restaurant is, at the moment, as successful as it is you really want to at least pretend to give a damn. I really should have asked if my tip was going to the sous chef instead of the waitress, cause she sure wasn't serving me my food and outlining what I had ordered.  But I digress. We're here to talk food, aren't we? BurGR serves, as the name implies, burgers. You can get the classic cheeseburger but there's lots of interesting little twists. For my visit, I went with truffle fries and a medium rare Farm Burger, which has duck bacon and a fried egg. There's really a lot of fries so one order can easily be split between two people, and you'll want to-- despite being cut into wedges (which is already kind of a bastardization of what us fat Americans want thank-you-very-much), they had a lot of flavor and the house ketchup really evened things out. Solid.  Then there's the burger.  Sometimes there can be too much of a good thing. (Don't look at me like that.) When I was ordering this burger, I was excited. Squirming in my chair, even. Not that hard to act like that after waiting so long to try the goods. But the problem with this particular burger is twofold: there's no real texture and the patty itself is pretty underseasoned. It's soft on soft on soft on soft-- soft and airy bun (tasty), soft patty, soft (and flavorless) egg, and limp (bordering soft) duck bacon. I really didn't get a strong beef taste-- I got a mild, distinct duck flavor.   And... that's kind of it.   The patty was woefully underseasoned and lacking a strong upfront presence. And isn't the burger meant to be the star? Did these Brits bring their underseasoned food here as well? Cause to me, biting into a burger should be an experience. When you bite into that patty, you want that hit of char and salt on your tongue, beefy fat dribbling down your chin and on your fingers, the other ingredients lending texture and cutting richness. Right? Was it strange that I thought In-N-Out does a better burger than this? Is it blasphemous to say that? Cause screw it, I will. The burger was lacking in soul, ingredients be damned. The whole is more than the sum of its parts and all that.   If you want a solid burger there's other places to hit in Vegas. BurGR's worth a try for certain if you're willing to brave the wait, but if you're thinking you're about to bite into the best burger of your life... eh, you can do better."}
{"text":"Food: Hell's Kitchen Burger, Maui Onion Rings, and Stone ruination for the beer. The burger was great.  I had it \"medium\" and it was juicy and perfect. It has jalapeno, so it can be a bit spicy for some people and I liked the kick it had.  Maui onion rings was good.  The beer was very good. A little bit bitter, full flavor, just the way I like it.  I'd recommend it.  Price: For a premium burger, the price was reasonable.  Mine was $13.  Onion rings and fries were too expensive.  They range around $7, just too much.  It is fries and onion rings after all.  The beer was $8, I think.  Worth the price.  Service: Long line! Once I was seated the waiter came quickly but I think it took 25 min to 30 min to get my \"burger\".  I know it's not McDonald but unreasonably long wait.  The kitchen staff were full speed...maybe they need a bigger kitchen and more staff.  Friendly service.  Conclusion: I'd love to go back to try other burgers and fries.  But only when I'm on vacation as the wait is looooong."}
{"text":"While it took quite a while for the food to get out that day, I would have to say that the burger was cooked exactly as requested.  It was flavorful and not overly priced by Strip standards.  The shakes were unusual (from my perspective) and again not overly priced.  I was sitting at the counter and was just watching the parade in front of me, as the line progressed in the kitchen.  Like a precision machine."}
{"text":"Better than Unami for me, but just slightly.   Got the Europe Burgr. Ordered medium rare. Cooked perfectly.  Got a bar seat and skipped the long line. Definitely check the place out if you're a burger fan."}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had. Flawless. No extras were present on table and none were required. Got a nice menu card as a souvenir. Loved the experience!"}
{"text":"Really good place to go and eat.  A little pricey but it's worth it.  Service is amazing."}
{"text":"Went here on Day 1 of my Vegas trip. Walked the 2+ miles from the Venetian. Waited about an hour. Totally worth it. I got the burger with the chanterelle mushrooms and fig onion jam on it and it was fantastic. Fries and rings were killer too. Will definitely try to go back when in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Like many others, I visited Planet Hollywood and saw the new niche burger restaurant at the entrance of the casino and thought I would give it a try.   Was seated immediately and Was pleased with table arrangement and dining ware. Most of the staff are fairly attractive and the women wear dresses that certainly shows off their figures. On image alone, the restaurant gets an A. One annoynace however was the loud high energy dance music that was being played inside the resturant. I found it rather distracting and made it hard to hear other people in my party from just across the table.   Our food came out pretty fast after placing our order and the presentation of each our burger was great as well. I ordered the All American Burger which cost around $15 along with the Truffle Parmesian fries which cost about the same.   My expectations were pretty high for this burger due to Gordon's reputation but to be perfectly honest with you, I was not impressed by the burger at all.   I'm not a fan of tall burgers. The buns are firm and quite thick. All the ingredients appeared to be fresh and the meat was cooked to my liking but all together, it made for a rather bland and boring burger. I was expecting for a taste explosion but it never happened. I've made better burgers at home on my personal grill.   The truffle parmersian fries were presented in a cone with a white truffle sauce and a sweet/spicey ketchup. The fries themselves were incredibly salty and had LOADS of parmesian cheese covering the cone. Between the salt and the cheese, it made more for a slightly sour and bitter taste. The whitle truffle sauce really had no flavor to it and was similar to dipping your fries in something like mayo or tartar sauce. The sweet/spicey ketchup is the sauce I liked more but even then, it wasn't great.   After receiving the tab of $47 for 2 burgers, 2 drinks, and the fries; I felt Gordon got the last laugh. Dining at the Earl of Sandwich (also located at Planet Hollywood) would have been a much better option."}
{"text":"Went for my Birthday July 14th, this was my 3rd time there and the food was phenomenal as always. However the service was a little slower than usual and the place mats smelled like mold, we notified the waitress of the odor and she gladly removed the mats and cleaned the surface of the table with a disinfecting napkin.  She apologized for the slow service and the smell and she kept a smile the whole time. After the end of our dinner she gave us these delicious push pop ice cream things for my birthday, they were amazing. And I can't wait to try Chef Ramsay's other restaurants in vegas."}
{"text":"My first visit about two weeks after the opening was amazing.  My second visit, not so much.    This restaurant has become very popular, and there is often a long line of people waiting to be seated.  We arrived at off-peak time on a Sunday afternoon, so the wait was only about 5 to 10 minutes.  The restaurant was nevertheless packed inside and on the loud side.  I could be mistaken, but there seemed to be more tables in the dining area than before. In any event, if you are not seated in a booth, you will be pretty close to the adjacent tables.    The service during my first visit rivaled fine dining.  This time, the service was slow, infrequent, and unpolished.  It took too long for our server to make her appearance after we were seated.  She was soft spoken, so it was hard to hear her over the din of the crowded restaurant.  When I asked her what beers they have on tap, she appeared to me to be annoyed by my question and placed an iPad in front of me to peruse.  She took our order very mater of factly and was on her way.    It must have taken 15 minutes for my beer to arrive, and that was about 10 minutes after my buddy's diet coke was delivered by a staffer who informed us the beer he didn't bring would be coming \"soon.\"   Some other guy eventually brought the beer.    It took a good while longer for the food to come out.  I ordered my burger medium, but the burger I was served was well done.  I ate it without saying anything to avoid further annoyance to our server and because lord knows how long it would have taken to get a replacement.    We were staying at the Encore, so having lunch here wasn't exactly convenient.  Based on my first experience, the place seemed worth going out of my way for.  Based on my second visit, I might give it another chance, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do it."}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch.  There was a short line but it moved quickly.  We had a party of six and were told it would be 40-45 minutes; however, they were able to seat us within 5!  (Brownie points for that!)  After reading earlier reviews, I went with the farm burger.  My wife had the Hell's kitchen burger.  We were both satisfied with each.  They were juicy and tasty and cooked to order (we both went with medium).  They weren't like knock-your-socks-off delish, but definitely decent.  I'd recommend trying this place if you're in the neighborhood.    We tried all the fries--parmesan truffle, just fries, and sweet potato fries.  They were all good and came with tantalizing sauces for dipping.  If you like sweet potatoes, I'd definitely recommend the sweet potato fries.  They were absolutely amazing and worth going back for.  Also tried the onion rings and they were good as well (the dipping sauce added to their flavor).    The service was average.  At the time we ate there, they weren't super busy but we still had to wait longer than usual to get refills and/or additional items.  In short, have I had more tasty burgers?  Yes.  Have I paid more for burgers?  Yes.  Have I paid less for burgers?  Of course.  So where does this one fall in the mix?  I'd rate it above average, but definitely not tops.  Worth checking out though."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick dinner on a Friday night before going to Skyjump. I walked from Caesars to Planet Hollywood and sat at an open seat at the bar.  They have cutlery and a menu at the open spots at the bar. No wait or reservations. The bartenders are very quick. Robert gave me a tablet with a beer menu. I had the Truffle Burger and an Arrogant Bastard ale. I wanted to try the truffle parmesan fries too, but I didn't want to be too full before the jump. I asked for the burger to be well done since it's hamburger and not a steak. He said it'd take 20 minutes. I said, that's fine, obviously it'd have to be cooked at a lower heat to still be juicy when well done.   I patiently waited and watched preseason football and soccer on the TV's. I slowly sipped the beer as I was on an empty stomach. It was delivered to me by a server, when it arrived and I bit in, it was amazing! Perfect with a nice char! The sauces were delicious. I devoured it and washed it down with the beer. Possibly the best burger I've ever had. Hard to go back to Habit or In n Out after that."}
{"text":"My guy and I were so happy to see that there were chicken and turkey burger options for those that don't eat red meat. We substituted the beef for chicken on the Farm Burger and the Uber Burger. A \"yardbird\" is the term for that. It was pretty crowded but service was on point and up to speed. Definitely worth checking out while your hanging out on The Strip. Also Shake #4 is seriously decadent and the perfect size for sharing"}
{"text":"Went here expecting to be wow'd and left extremely disappointed. We ordered the wings for an appetizer and they were good.  (Spicy but good). Then I ordered the American burger and basic frys.  The frys were plain not much salt at all and none was on the table.  The ketchup was made by the restaurant and in my opinion, it was no Heinz. The burger was mediocre at best.  I would say, the restaurant is completely over priced.  Al la cart.  I and my party were completely dissatisfied and would not return.  You are better off at Wendy's."}
{"text":"The service and food was superb!!! Although it was a bit pricey for burgers, it was totally worth it! especially to experience a place where Hell's Kitchen was filmed!  It was a wonderful experience and fun ambience in the a prime location on the Strip.  Definitely a go-to casual place in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Finally tried one of Gordon's restaurants. Really pleased with the quality of the Angus beef. Try the Euro Burger! Very tasty This restaurant is also halal friendly to those Muslims out there (beef only). Will definitely return the next time I return to Vegas ."}
{"text":"We waited in line for dinner for about half an hour; not too long, considering the brand. Our hopes were pretty high and there were elements of our meal that met our expectations,  but we left slightly disappointed (probably our fault for expecting so much from a burger joint). The jalapeño poppers were fine- crunchy and spicy and very meaty. The chanterelle burger was perfect - the platonic ideal burger - but the hell's kitchen burger was only average - a little bland and a tiny bit slimy. The fries had the perfect amount of salt. The big disappointment of the night was the sticky toffee. This dessert seemed to be all about the novelty of using a push pop, and the toffee flavor/texture was really lacking. There was a nice selection of beers on tap and the decorations and lighting were well thought out."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had period. Which is no wonder there's always a line waiting around the corner. Wife said it definitely was her best. She had the Hells Kitchen burger and I had the Brittania. Fries were also above average. The only thing stopping me from giving a 5 star rating was the water taste like sh1t."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing meals of my life.   Interior: cool vibe and modern flair. Not closed, but opened view into the casino. Feels larger than it is, and decorated quite nicely with pops of orange, espresso, and silver metal accenting.   Food:   farm burger. A simple, but impeccably cooked and seasoned burger, decorated with a farm egg and duck fat bacon. All farm components, balanced nicely without grease. The bun is sprinkled with a variety of seeds. All adds to the flavor. This burger isn't overwhelming in size, but is surprisingly filling. No complaints.   Parmesan truffle fries: cooked to a perfect crisp. You've got a nice crunch and softer inside to these fries. Complimentary sauces are interesting and complex. The chipotle keptchup was a complex dip requiring multiple dips that kept tempting your palate for more.  Sweet potato fries: never had anything like it. Who knew that dousing these crispers with powdered vanilla sugar would make it a complete game changer!!! There was also a sweet jalapeño aioli dipping sauce that these fries just had to keep making love to. I only dream for the day I can have these again.   On a return trip I would love to try dessert, since I'm sure it's only nothing but more deliciousness Gordon Ramsay has to offer. If in Vegas, this is a new must for me. A traditional must. I'll always come back for more here"}
{"text":"Loved it! We were seated pretty quickly. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. We ordered the farm burger and the bleu burger to share. Both were delicious! The truffle fries were awesome! It was a great experience! It will definitely be one of my stops next time I'm in Vegas. I only wish there was one in LA."}
{"text":"We were there 11:30pm on a Saturday night, it's not that busy, so we were sit right away. The waitress is super friendly. They use an iPad and leaves it on the table for us to select our cocktails. We ordered onion rings, fries, the 5 spice chicken slider, the hell kitchen's burger which was super spicy for me, but it's so delicious! Yum."}
{"text":"Yum!   Loved this place from the moment I said \"table for 2\". I didn't even mind the fact we needed to wait 30 minutes for a table. They just told me they would text me when the table would be ready with the approximate time as well. I wandered off to gamble and they texted me at exactly the time they told me. Awesome.   My bf got the fish and chips burger. It was a different twist on the concept, especially since when the server brought it to us, it looked like a huge hot dog. Weird right? Interesting nonetheless. The only complaint from him was that there was more bun than fish. He devoured it nonetheless.   I ordered the Farm Burger, duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar and a fried egg. It was delicious and very tasty. It's one of those burgers that you just fall in love with.   We also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries. I like them crispy so this was a tad disappointing as they are the fat fries that are very potatoe-y. The truffle aioli that came with as a dipping sauce was aweome and it made me forget about the non-crispy fries.   Also, we had the chocolate hazelnut pudding and coffee shake. It was INCREDIBLE!!! I normally am not the biggest fan of a shake, its always too thick or something is just off but the texture was just smooth and creamy. You could enjoy it and not need to suck too hard... =P. So where does the pudding come in? It comes in right on top! It was different, and a GOOD different. Yum. I would come back just to get this shake. I like Holstein's shakes, but this was just better.   If you are a Total Rewards member, you get a dollar off here and there. Nice plus!"}
{"text":"Let me first say that I am not a burger eating kind of gal. I will be honest about having my doubts about paying for a $14 (on average) for a \"gourmet\" burger. This place blew this thought out of the water fairly quickly.   My group and I decided to share 2 burgers and fries. What we learned was that we should have just either gotten the 2 burgers to share or 3 burgers instead. But honestly, we were pretty filled with the hell's kitchen (beef: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato) & southern yardbird (chicken: sharp cheddar, mustard BBQ sauce, pickle, butter lettuce) burgers and sweet potato fries.   Our group had one guy so don't think it was only 3 girls with itty bitty appetites. We were all pretty filled and content after leaving this place to explore Planet Hollywood some more. The portion size was on the larger side as the meat patty was anything but small. The service was GREAT as our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful (I asked for recommendations for a cell phone repair place and our server asked around and came back with a place).  I would absolutely recommend this place if you're wanting the most juicy and tender burgers--like ever. :) If you're visiting the casinos in the area, this place is a great place to eat--and in walking distance of the casinos as well. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is very popular so be patience if there is a slight line."}
{"text":"Bueno Cheef Gordon  soy un admirador tuyo , quizas porque soy Emotional Coach y la parte de coaching del programa me engancha.  Sin dura la calidad de los productos es buena, solamente buena que conste, nada espectacular ni extraordinario, eso si correcta con el precio .  El lugar me gusta, aunque la particularidad de este casino son estos espacios tan especiales y su distribu ion en general. si te estas preguntando si volvere, sin duda Si, no obstante para impresionar tengo otros rtes. mejores. Aprovado, ahora ve, come y cuentanos que tal te ha ido..."}
{"text":"The place seems nice and decor is also quite contemporary. Right at the entrance of Planet Hollywood.  The chicken burgers are pretty amazing. It's not a regular chicken breast or anything, but very well made patty with ground chicken and herbs.  The veggie burger is a HUGE disappointment ... Really bad."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype or money. It was good but not $15 for a small burger and $11 for fries good. Service was good not great.  Overall, if Gordon Ramsay himself were here this is a place he would complain about."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  Great burgers! The sweet potato fries sprinkled with crack..(powered sugar) is amazing. Don't kid yourself..sweet potato FRIED instantly loses its healthy label..so might as well add sugar and really enjoy it."}
{"text":"I stayed at Planet Hollywood for a work conference. Was planning on eating at a restaurant in Paris, however while walking out this restaurant had a long line and a great reputation.   If you have more than three people you can put your name in and they will text you 15 minutes before your table is ready. My party and I waiting around 45 minutes, which I think is an okay amount of time.   We sat down and order drinks and food. We all ordered onion rings (3 stars), Parmesan aoli french fries (5 stars), and three burgers (5 stars). The burgers and fries were absolute amazing. I personally like when my bun isn't soggy from grease and condiments, so it was perfect for me. the meat was cooked just as I asked, but the bun is what really makes it a great burger.   The reason for taking away one star is because there menu had over 3 beers offered which they did not have, the wait time for food was a bit long 40 minutes, and they didn't have regular ketchup.. Which to a ketchup fan is a bummer. Would I go back? You better believe it!"}
{"text":"This place serves up one heck of a burger! There are so many clever combinations of burgers and names that goes with them.  I always like Gordon Ramsay's shows and I always wanted to try a restaurant of his. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it packs a punch. It comes with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomatoes. The meat was moist and juicy, the jalapeños makes it have a spicy kick, and all the other toppings makes the burger complete.  My friend ordered the Damnation Chicken Burger. When you order a chicken burger what do you think of?  Dry? Piece of chicken breast across a bun?  Not this place!  It was a patty style chicken burger that was moist.  It came with hot mayo, cheese, and a carrot slaw.  They also have fries, shakes, salads, and snack.  They have two unique ketchups one being a curry flavor and the other a chipotle flavor.  The decor there is nice, clean, and sharp looking.  They have a bar where you can enjoy a drink while watching a sports game and having a burger.  Highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Overall my experience at BurGR was alright. Sabrina our waitress was AWESOME! She's the main reason I'm writing this review. We had a table of 8 and she handled it like a pro  Food: 4/5- I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was really good. If you like spicy, this is for you. Other burgers ordered at my table were the bleu burger, farm burger, American burger, Britannia burger and the yardbird burger. Along with the burgers, we all ordered either the truffle or the plain fries. The aioli that comes with the truffle fries are amazing! But there were so many that I don't think anyone finished their fries.   Service: Hostesses: 2/5- we were able to put our names down on the list and they texted us when our table was ready. But our original group was 6 and grew to 8. When I went to ask the hostess if it would be possible to change our number, she looked at me like I was crazy and then told me she would have to add between 15-30 mins on top of what we were already quoted to wait, making our total wait time a little under an hour. I totally understood until the group of 6 of us got seated and there was plenty of space to add another small table if not the empty table for two that was already there next to us. Luckily our friends still showed up and were able to be seated with us since the other waiters found an extra table and chair.   Waiter/waitresses: 7/5- yeah I know my math doesn't make sense but all of the wait staff was amazing. Our main waitress (Sabrina) took our orders and even asked which people were together when we asked if it would be possible to split our checks. There was a gratuity already on the bill but she deserved waaaayyyy more than what was on there. She constantly came by to check on us and refill our waters since we were thirsty and dehydrated from the weather."}
{"text":"I am surprised I haven't written a review for this place yet. Gordon Ramsay's burGR restaurant is exactly the type of food you'd expect GR to come up with. The burgers are crafted with interesting flavors and ingredients. My favorite of the burgers is the BRITANIA with that mango chutney and nutty arugula. That mango chutney did the trick with the sweet and sour taste the bring the burger alive.   Another popular burger is the FARM BURGER - ordered by 5 of the 7 people at my table. Its duck meat with bacon and eggs. Definitely a heart-stopper if you know what I mean. Tons of flavor though. :]   I also split the Honey-Pig Bao Buns with a friend which was delicious but a bit over-priced for three tiny buns. But what can you expect from the infamous Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"Good burgers! But maybe not worth the crazy wait times.  I came here with my family over the holiday break and the entire strip was packed with people and every place had a huge wait time, So BurGR did as well. We got there and there was atleast a 45 minute wait, but we were able to put our name on the list and were told we'd receive a text when our table was ready, which was nice and gave us a chance to explore the Planet Hollywood Casino.   We ordered the regular fries which came with a spicy ketchup and a curry ketchup. They curry ketchup was super good! But I'm also biased and less of a fan of spicy.  We ordered the Farm Burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Euro Burger. All the burgers were very good--I had little bites of all of them. For my Farm Burger, I ordered it medium and the meat was done right, the egg on was PERFECT and super gooey on the inside, and all the flavors complimented each other very well.  Overall, it's a pretty busy place, but they have really great burgers and it isn't ridiculously expensive.   Also, fun fact that I didn't notice until someone pointed it out to me, but the GR in burGR is for Gordon Ramsey. xD"}
{"text":"I'm a world traveller, and I'll eat burgers around the US and Canada (since the beef is much better) I came here not expecting much, but I was impressed at the quality of the burger and fries here. I sat at the bar alone, and got great service from the bar staff. This is the best burger I have had in vegas for sure, and in my top 10 for the US."}
{"text":"If you want a gourmet, fancy, never-had-before burger this is your place. If you want a regular old burger that is a 5 star burger keep looking. This is a 4 star regular burger place. The beef is not that good. The sheer selection of burger cheeses, toppings, and beers that I had no clue what it was was startling. I have been working in 5 star restaurants since 15 years old and I had to look up so many mushrooms, cheeses, and sauces. That's never happened at a burger place. Three beers were by unknown breweries to me! That is monumental and the Rincon Cochon was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Average Burger. Good Hot dog though. Great Cookies & cream flan shake."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars, despite the 30 min+ waiting time. And as the name implies, this is a burger joint. Don't expect anything more and you'll enjoy your experience immensely.  My friends and I wanted to catch a late lunch so we hit up BurGR for some grub. Looking at the reviews, we were eager to try this place. Overall verdict: super glad we did.   As for ambiance...? Psh forget that. It's loud, lively, and bright. You've got flame displays, large TV screens, and bright red booth seating, all the makings of fun chow down session.  But let's not linger. Down to the food:   To Share:  * Roasted Jalapeno Poppers ($12) stuffed with cheddar bacon, served with cheddar ranch.   SO GOOD. This was probably the best of the four appetizer/sides we shared. Crispy crunchy outer skin, molten cheese on the inside, spicy kick from the jalapeno, more cheesy goodness to dip in. Mmmmmm yum. Not to mention, you get to play Russian Roulette because one of the poppers is extra spicy. May the odds be ever in your favor. ;)  * Beer Batter Maui Onion Rings ($9) topped with shaved parmigiano reggiano, served with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip.   If you like onion rings, this is the appetizer for you. Greasy goodness, extra crispy flaky outside, soft onion ring on the inside. I loved the chipotle ketchup but that's because I'm a ketchup slut.   * Sweet Potato Fries ($9) with vanilla powdered sugar and served with a honey jalapeno mayo.  Eh... this is where taste falls short. My group collectively thought it was too sweet. I thought it just lacked some \"umph\"... personally found it flavorless.  * Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11) which are hand cut and topped with truffle parmesan and truffle seas salt, served with a truffle aioli.   Perfect marriage of umami truffle flavor, starchy potato and cheesy parmesan goodness. Second favorite side ever.   *Shake #4 ($9) which is an oreo shake topped with a creme brulee pudding and an oreo cookie.   Delightful. Two people in our group shared it and it was as good as it sounds. You can ask for extra spoons and cups, and the restaurant will give them to you. YAY!   --  To Each His or Her Own:  * Hell's Kitchen Burger ($14) made with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato.   Friend said it was a good standard burger. It looked darn delish so I believe him.   * Chanterelle Burger ($16) made with chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, and figgy-onion jam.  Mmm... I was a little disappointed. The burger was solid, the taste was great, but the texture was off. There was no crunch factor, and I was just looking for something to offset the mushiness. Mushrooms were earthy, albeit chewy, the arugula was crushed under the bun so it was a bit deflated (and I wish it added a more peppery bite to the burger), and the figgy-onion jam just fell short. When you tell me the burger will be served with a figgy-onion jam, I want to taste fig and I want to taste caramelized onions. I barely taste either because the whole burger just sort of melded into one without fully highlighting each ingredient. :/ Hmm...and it was overall too oily for my liking. Could barely eat the thing without grabbing a napkin every so often to wipe my wrists and mouth.   * Farm Burger ($15) made with duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and a fried egg.   Awesome. I took a bite out of friend's and it was basically a homey vamped up version of a breakfast egg-muffin. Comfort food in the form of a burger? I'll be ordering that the next time we're here.   Again, very solid burger place. Total price came out to be ~$30.00 per person with tip and tax. Not too shabby Mr. Ramsay.   I shall return."}
{"text":"The service here was terrible. This was our second time here. The first experience was not bad-food was good but service left something to be desired. We went back for a second go round and it was not much better. While I know that there are over 2K great reviews for this place, it does not mean it is perfect. I was halfway through my burger and noticed that it looked a bit raw. We asked one of male servers working there if it looked ok to him. He did not think so and took it to show the manager. She came over to our table, said that she and the chef tore the burger apart and it was fine assuring me I would not get sick. I just wanted to know if it was raw, not throw it away or let me finish eating it. She said she assumed I did not want it anymore-No, I never said that. I just asked if it was ok. Fair enough question one would think. Needless to say, I had nothing more to eat as they threw my burger away. No offer to make a new one. When the bill came and we asked the server about how we we charged for a whole burger as I only ate half since they threw it away-she asked, \"did you want me to go back and get it?\" Yes, go fetch out of the garbage after two hands were pawing on it. Foolishness! So, we questioned the manager about it, she gave same snotty response. Believe me, I would have had something to eat and pay for it than you take it off the bill! But, the overall rudeness and stupidity of their remarks and condescending tones assured me that it was better to just take the dumb burger off my bill so I could get out of there."}
{"text":"Deliciousness!! The American burger was great. The wait time to eat was fairly short, we were quoted 30 minutes for a party of three, but were pages within 5 minutes. Now once we sat down the wait for our actual food was a lot longer. Probably about 30 minutes, it was worth the wait for the great food and service."}
{"text":"O...M.....G!!!! I must say that these burgers are AMAZING!!!! The best burger I ever had! Me and my family went on opening weekend so the service was top notch. The waiters were pleasant and very energetic. I got the Uber cheese burger that had 3 different cheeses on it, but I only remember goat cheese. And I split it and got another burger split that had Cheddar, mango chutney, and baby greens. If you are calorie counting or on a diet this is not the place to go! The patties are literally dipped in butter!!!! maybe that's why is so good..... The prices are reasonable for Vegas, but what hikes up your bill are the drinks and sides. If you just get the burger it's more than enough. However, we shared the Maui onion rings, and OMG your mouth will go to heaven. THIS IS A MUST TRY!!!! I was skeptical at first but I left completely satisfied. the bull was about $70 for 4 which is not the cheapest, but we ordered 4 burgers, Maui onion rings, fries and 2 drinks. And if you are a rewards member you get a dollar off each item! I look forward to going back. LOVE Gordon Ramsay, he did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This place is crazy good! The pickles were like homemade or something & had cinnamon & sounds crazy but super good.   Then there were the truffle fries!! Wow. I got the sweet potato fries which are really good, but my bf got the truffle fries & those were amazing.  I think I ate a million calories but honestly they were worth it"}
{"text":"A little pricey but worth every penny to get a great medium rare burger.  Going back in April"}
{"text":"Great Chef, killer location.  I'll keep it short. Head down to Luxor and go to Burger Bar. Unless of course you want a 20$ hot dog."}
{"text":"No wait, great atmosphere, kid friendly. Burgers, onion rings, & parmesan french fries were great!!!"}
{"text":"OK I am a HUGE fan of Gordon R and his shows...so when in Vegas we went to BurgGR and had a much anticipated burger. I had the Farm BurGR, I think as there really was nothing memorable about it. The seasoning seemed non existent the truffle fries... so what- my local Pub buried this place in taste and value (fair enough I certainly did expect to pay more here, but I also expected a bit more than a large fire). Still a Gordon Ramsey fan but I will think twice about celebrity eateries before entering so that I could say I ate there...next time I may lie and say I did and live in blissful ignorance. I guess the reality of it all is how much better can a person make a hamburger?  Any recommendations for my next  trip?"}
{"text":"One word...PERFECT.   We started with the jalapeño poppers & the Maui onion rings. Excellent start. The poppers are filled with cheese and bacon & the onion rings had the perfect breading consistency.    I ordered the farm burger, and my group shared the parmesan truffle fries. The one order of fries was plenty to share with my group of 4. (maybe because we were already stuffed from the abundance of great food).  Overall I was thoroughly impressed with both the staff and the food. I just wish I had room for dessert! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So the wait was a little linger than expected but I assume most restaurants by celebrity chefs are. Once finally in we ordered the jalapeño poppers for the promise of at least one of them being spicy. Rarely are jalapeño poppers spicy and this was no exception. The farm burger was good.. Well cooked and the egg made it even better. I enjoy eggs.  Also tried the Parmesan fries which were also good. All in all I would come back if the line was shorter!"}
{"text":"Located inside Planet Hollywood, it's literally the first thing you see if you walk in. Perhaps that's precisely why there's a long wait because it wasn't that great. Also, there's no way you can reserve here, so that long line makes the place seem pretty enticing as well. Oh, and not to mention a literal fire incased in glass window that really grabs your eye. But anyways, expect a 20+ minute wait near lunch or dinner time.  Ok now to the food. To start off, we had the \"Just Fries.\" And they were pretty good fries - nothing too special but well fried. The onion rings were huge, and well-fried as well. I had the Gordon Ramsay burger (off-menu), which seemed like the \"everything burger\" as it had the regular beef patty, duck bacon, avocado, etc. It was... ok... Honestly the flavor was too much. And, in the end, everything just tasted too salty.  The service was pretty efficient for what it's worth. We asked for new plates after we finished our fries, and our waitress quickly brought them out. Granted we were seated literally in front of where the waiters had the computers to put-in orders and print out receipts, I wouldn't be surprised if other areas get overlooked because of the sheer number of people in the venue."}
{"text":"Best burger of my life.  But seriously, best ever!  I had the uber cheeseburger.  Amazing.  We also had the parmesan mushroom fries with garlic aoli.  Just deliciousness.  Probably overpriced, but it's Vegas and I was on vacation.    Our server was very friendly and attentive.  The wait time for a table was short.    I would definitely go back for another burger and fries, only next time, I would save room for the toffee push pop dessert.  It looked amazing but I was too full."}
{"text":"Honey-pig bao buns. Deliciously different. Farm burger was ok. Hell's Kitchen burger was exactly it. It had a kick and lots of flavor. Ordered the standard dog without it being simmered in hellfire sauce and truffle fries for my kids. The bread was buttered toasted. They loved it so that was a plus too. The wait was not long at about 2pm on a weekday but the food came out real slow."}
{"text":"Hog burger has sweet tasty mangalitsa pork, bacon, bbq pork, white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion and slaw. Even better is Forest burger with strong tremor cheese that slightly overwhelms seasonal forest mushrooms, arugula, duck bacon with deliciously thick flavorful grilled patty."}
{"text":"Get the onion rings.  Add jalapeños to your burger.  Get that duck bacon.  I temporarily quit a year long keto diet for this place. Gained a few lbs. Ain't even mad."}
{"text":"Came at 6pm. Waited less than 5 mins to be seated. However the food took so long! The noisy environment didnt help because we practically had to shout at each other during conversations. unless you are seated next to each other, you better have a full battery on your phone.   The people next to our table complained about their food. They've been waiting for an hour and they have been asking for their food several times only to be told '2 minutes'. I didnt mean to pry but like i said, it was noisy and she had to raise her voice.   The burger was above average but not eye popping wowzer. Hubs and i both had Hell's Kitchen burger as recommended by our waitress.   It's quite expensive for a slow service so i wouldnt come back. Oh, our food came after about 45 mins of waiting. Probably more."}
{"text":"Oversalted overpriced garbage. I ordered the Farm burger. The duck bacon tasted like a salt-lick. The burger, itself, had almost no flavor. It was a good-sized patty, though. I asked for roasted jalapenos. For a SLIVER of jalapeno I got charged $3.00 and of course the waiter didn't even bother to mention that I'd be getting reamed, but hey it's Vegas. My wife ordered the Hell's Kitchen. It was also bland and the mushy tomatoes were disgusting and didn't complement the burger at all.   The fries were decent, skin on and thick. One order was more than enough for two people. The fries are the reason BOOGR isn't getting one star. I would've preferred plain ketchup to the over spiced curry and chipotle travesties that came with the fries. They had regular ketchup but, again, it was super salty. It appears the only flavor Gordon Ramsey understands is salt.  Service: There are signs telling you to check with the hostess before getting into line, so I asked the surly bimbo up front and she simply told me to go stand in line. What was I supposed to check-in for?  There's a local place in Pasadena, CA that has almost the same burger but does it SO much better. Someone should scream at Ramsey for this trainwreck of a burger place."}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting and it's awesome! I had the Hell's Kitchen burger cooked medium well.  Great choice if you like spicy food. It's really good! We also had the truffle Parmesan fries.....so good!! This time I had room for dessert and got Shake #3.... OMG so delicious. StafThe only thing is a downside is the wait other than that everything is good. I still give it 5 stars despite the wait!"}
{"text":"A complete miss with this place. I don't know how exactly they accumulated a rating of 4/5 stars from over 4K reviews but there wasn't much to praise about. For the first time it feels like Yelp has failed to do its job.   Sadly it was just mediocre burgers and fries with Gordon Ramsay's name slapped on the menu. TAP sports bar at MGM is a much better option."}
{"text":"I wish I could do half star rating, because I would have went with three and a half stars.  I got a burger, fries and a beer and it was about 30 dollars. The food and service were good but not for the price."}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen Burger = Best Burger Ever! Coffee Shake = Epic! Sweet Potato Fries = Perfect!"}
{"text":"I was able to grub at this eatery over the weekend.  there was a line outside and took us thirty mins to be seated. we would have been seated sooner but were missing two friends from our party. the hostesses makes you wait until the entire party is there to seat you, just an FYI.  we started off with the jalepeno poppers and beer battered onion rings.  the poppers were just ok.  really didn't think much of it.  however, the onion rings were my favorite item.  it's battered with newcastle beer and perfectly crisp.  Absolute perfection! I ordered the hell burger and asked for it to be cooked medium.  To be honest, I've had better.  My burger was a bit dry and really didn't live up to my expectations.  However, my friends who ordered the the duck burger and the bf went with the pulled pork burger all seemed to enjoy it, so much that they ate ever morsel!! If I do return, I would probably try another burger.    For dessert the bf and I shared the #5 shake!  Omg!! This was sooooo delicious.  If I didn't fill up on all the other grub during our seating, no doubt, I would've demolished it!    All in all, service was great!  Everyone was attentive and on top of things and I'm willing to give this place another shot and like I said before probably will order another burger off the menu since they had others that caught my eye."}
{"text":"I had Shake #1 and a Truffle burger with a side of truffle parmesan fries and they were very heavenly. The shake was the best shake I've ever had, it was very smooth and not too sweet. My mom is not a fan of milkshakes, but liked it so much she got one of her own! The fries were fresh and crispy and seasoned lightly. My only complaint was that the burger patty could have been a little more juicier, but overall it was delicious! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This new burger joint at Planet Hollywood is good news for late night snackers. Who could resist getting gourmet burger 1 in the morning after a long day on the strip?   The 'Gordon Ramsay' brand doesn't mean much to me. I have been to far to many restaurants named after celebrity chefs that offers nothing more than just gimmickry over-priced mediocre food. I am happy BurGr isn't one of those places. The burgers I tried were actually quite good especially the portobello one (Earth Burger). The mushrooms were so juicy and flavorful that it almost rivals a slice of real beef patty.  Buns were nicely toasted with good spongy texture. Rest of the toppings were fresh. The normal beef one I had (Hells' Kitchen) was good but not exceptional.  Granted the food is still fairly expensive for what is it (~$15 for a burger) but at least the price isn't too far off from other Vegas restaurants located on prime strip locations.   My major complaint is the upkeep of the restaurant. It is a fairly new establishment but the seats and tables are already look like they have seen better days. The utensils and plates were not dried properly and have very oblivious watermarks on them. Cleanliness could be a bit of a concern for this very busy place."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and not horribly priced. My friend got the Britannia burger and I had the Euro burger. Both were great although the truffle fries with the truffle on the euro burger was very rich (albeit delicious). The parmesan truffle fries were wonderful. The service was pretty prompt. Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. My friend got the oreo Milk shake which crem brule pudding topper which was decadent.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG!!  THE BEST BURGER ON THIS PLANET!  I could not believe how DELICIOUS my burger was.. Tender juicy.... Melts in ur mount..:. The bun was out of control... It was like as tender as butter!!!!  Jalapeño poppers and onion rings were out of control delicious!!!  Keep in mind we were a party of 15 and every single person was amazed in the quality and amazing flavor in the meat and other items that we ordered.  GO GORDON! You did it again! Open up 1 in LA now!"}
{"text":"Stood and waited for 30 mins for a table. What was really disheartening was the amount of empty tables we could see through the the pointless but clearly expensive glass sign.   While Gordon may be a renowned chef world wide, it's doesn't excuse the ridiculous get up that is presented here. Empty tables = no one paying: why the hel make people queue needlessly when there are perfectly good tables available.   Sadly we didn't wait to sample the food but there is no excuse for this crap! Can I say btw we counted 32 empty seats alone. This was in the back as we walked by!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here a while ago, I thought it was okay.  It didn't knock my socks like I thought it would. The burger was cooked right but lacked flavor. They line was long to get seated, plus we had our babies so we weren't allowed to dine in. We ordered ours togo. She did say it rudely.  Blah, II Would never come back for mediocre food and bad service."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, made me wonder what I'm doing with my life in terms of the burgers I've eaten by comparison to the ones here at Gordon Ramseys Burgr.  Guy and Kurtis were amazing with us, Kurtis going the extra mile, demonstrating his vocal talents by request. Made the experience incredible and memorable. Will absolutely come back and recommend next time we're in Vegas. Guy also resolved a bad experience with one of the beers, Squatters IPA. Thanks again guys!   Definitely the must be place. Friendly staff, great food!"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas for one day, but one word defines this place is Exceptional. Quality servers' with excellent customer service skills. Dont need to ask for refills and bring us refills. Hot waiters too. Well worth the wait to get in and eat at this restuarant. I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and finally got to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restuarant. If visiting Las Vegas again definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"On our recent trip to Las Vegas, trying BurGR was one of the top things we wanted to do because 1) I like burgers and 2) I'm a fan or Ramsey's TV shows.    The restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood complex right off the Strip.  You can't miss it as there's a large fire decoration in the front referencing Hell's Kitchen of course.  Seated in a  booth we looked over the menu.  Surprisingly, the burgers were more reasonable than I expected.  The Ramsey name and this being Vegas, I expected BurGR to be the most expensive hamburger of my life.  Many burgers I've had in San Francisco were more expensive.  Ordered a pretty basic burger with cheese along with the fries.    The sides were on the expensive side but were large and meant to share.  The fries were perfectly cooked, the burger juicy and a perfect medium rare.  Everyone really enjoyed the food, the setting and the service.   What was intended as a \"since we\"re in Vegas let's check out Ramsey's place\" morphed into \"wow, we found a really nice, classy burger joint with great food and service\".  We'll be regulars when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was with my wife and daughter. It is certainly a busy location. The host was nice informing us that she would text us when our table was ready. It was late, about 9:30PM and we were hungry. After a long day, we were looking forward to dining at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant because of the reputation of the quality of food and service. Unfortunately, the service was very disappointing.  We received a text that our table was ready, then were told to stand \"on the carpet\" about 10 feet away from the podium she was at, presumably to stay out of the way. It seemed a bit demeaning the way we were instructed to do this. Then we stood there for another 15-20 minutes without being told what was happening, while the hosts were chatting away and joking around. It just felt unprofessional.  Then we were finally escorted to our table and were waited on by a waiter who seem very nonchalant and uninterested in serving us. He would walk by many times and not give us any attention. He never offered to fill out water. We placed our order and my daughter ordered a milk shake, and he came by after about 20 minutes and told us the shake would be brought to us right away. Ten minutes later it came and 5 minutes after that another one came brought by another person. We told him we already have the shake. It was obvious that she was already drinking from it. Makes one wonder who is in charge. The we waited about another 25-30 minutes before our burgers came, no explanation, no apologies. This is ironic considering on most of Gordon Ramsay's shows, i.e., Hells Kitchen, he totally loses his cool when customers are waiting for protracted times. All told, we waited about an hour before we got our entrees.   The food was fabulous but I was very frustrated about the service which detracts from the dining experience. At one point, I believe the manager came by the table next to ours and asked how their meal was and chatted a bit, but he didn't give us the time of day. Again, making us feel that our business and patronage was not important. There was not a lot to be happy about. I wish I could say I would be back, but I am really not sure if this is the type of treatment I am going to receive."}
{"text":"Long wait to get in. Most of us got the farm burger which was good. We also got regular fries and truffle fries. The truffle fries with the aioli sauce was delicious! Service was great because the waiter was quick with everything and water was constantly refilled, almost after every sip. Definitely a bit pricey for the amount of food you get but that should be expected."}
{"text":"Food and service was good!  The chicken wings were AMAZING (I've had cravings for them since we left)!!! The truffle fries were great as well.  My only disappointment was the dessert we ordered.  They were some kind of pudding pop, not very tasty... The cake layer inside was extremely dry.  I would definitely go back...Especially for those chicken wings!!!! YUMMM...."}
{"text":"Having always wanted to try one of Gordon Ramsay's Restaurants I finally got to do so on my last trip to Vegas. Because we didn't have much time we decided to eat at the bar since we were able to get right in if we did. There was a long line when we arrived which we thought was just to be seated and ended up being just to put your name on the list. Be prepared to wait if you decide to eat here. The bartendor was very nice though and you can order anything off the menu at the bar. I decided to go with the plan old cheese burger and fries. The fries are sold ala cart so be sure to order those or you will just get a burger. My burger was prepaired perfectly. It was juicy and the bun was very fresh. I really liked the multi grain buns they had great flavor. The fries were also quite good but what really made them was the homemade ketchup. It had a bit of kick to it and I don't normally like Ketchup on my fries but thought this was exceptional. Cost to eat here is high for a burger place also. Was over $30 a person for a burger. Over all one of the best burgers I have had!"}
{"text":"I dont care that we had to wait in line for 30 minutes and that I missed a Jabawockeez show.  The food n drinks were to die for.  Service was awesome..we had the fries, burger and I had a shake but added in kahlua for an extra kick.  I dream of this place."}
{"text":"Came here late night for a burgr (I live across the street at CityCenter).  Had the chanterelle burger and also ordered the bao buns as a starter.  The bao buns were amazingly bland.  The pork was nice but underseasoned.  It was on the tough/chewy side, so hard to eat it in more than two bites (two pieces/bun, one piece of pork/bite).  The garnishes on it were terrible.  The carrots were barely pickled.  Was hoping the burger would be better, but it had the same problem.  The arugula was superfluous as it didn't add much (I enjoy arugula but couldn't taste the nuttiness).  The waiter proudly told me that the patty was a three cut blend of beef, but all I could taste was cardboard (sorry).  No seasoning was detected.  The burger was on the sweet side, so I asked for ketchup (which was their homemade kind, and also on the too-sweet side), and then asked for pickles because the burger needed a bite, but was told that all they had were really sweet bread and butter pickles, so I declined.    Service was good, if not a bit obsequious.  The greeter was a lovely lady - very polite with a nice smile.  The waiter kept coming by to tell me that my bao buns would be right up, and did so about 4 times before they came (I don't think that it really took that long, but coming by so often to tell me that they were coming made it seem like it was taking forever).  My favorite burger spot in LV is Bachi Burger - off strip, although haven't had a huge sampling yet of strip burger joints."}
{"text":"Pros: the waiter was extremely good looking. The burgr was one step up from 5Guys.  Cons: the hostess explained that they seat parties every six minutes in order to always have a line....even when the restaurant is empty.   The beefcake waiters are also a bit dense and quite horrible servers.   On our way out, we met the manager...he's borrowed Mr Ramsey's TV persona in a bad way.   Bottom line: it's a decent burgr, but it's overshadowed by artificial waits, poor service and staff attitude."}
{"text":"All in all, a little disappointing. The wait was the first turn off, should have made reservations. No biggie. Anyway, had the hell's kitchen burger. The ingredients were high quality, delicious and unique for a burger. All in all, the menu is actually awesome, however, I would say the restaurant has a lack of proper execution of these great ideas and the littlest mistakes can ruin your experience there. I ordered my burger \"medium-well\" and well, it came out RAW in the middle. Like the burger was seared. Like i said, the burger was tasty and well thought out to be flavorful. But when you can't even cook a burger to temperature, you ruined the whole dam thing. I ended up eating the raw burger anyway since I was starving and didn't want to wait 25 minutes for another burger. The burger meat was excellent though and you can tell it is ground in house, which put me at ease (a little) about possibly ingesting e-coli. The fries, once again...Great flavors, great side sauces...fries were soggy, old and actually could have been more crispy. Execution failed again. The onion rings were the best part of the meal actually. Fried perfectly, very delicious dipping sauces. So my biggest takeaway from this place is, why is everything rushed?? I know you're busy and this is a strip hotel...but I'm paying quite a bit for a burger and fries ($35 for fries, burger, beer) I expect that burger to be cooked perfectly. I'm paying \"perfection prices\" and i deserve nothing short of that. All in all, its a trendy las vegas restaurant that has fallen victim to the almighty dollar and \"turn-n-burn\" service. I am now fully convinced that the best burgers on earth are the ones from your backyard grill, not some celebrity charging an arm and a leg for a half assed burger. Or if you're in the area, go to crown and anchor British pub, order their burger at a 1/3 the price. Oh and yes they know how to cook meat to temperature ;-)"}
{"text":"This place saved my butt! It's open late and I just got out of the MJ show hungry! Quick yelp search for late night food and this place came up Highly recommended!  I ordered the Portobello Mushroom sandwich! Best one I've ever had. Hubby said best burger he's had! We also had the truffle oil fries! To die for! For dessert we had the Creme brûlée Oreo, Yes, Oreo shake! Wow!!  If you want a great burger this is the place!"}
{"text":"absolutely delicious and great service. i was impressed coming from california and having food on the level. would definitely recommend uber cheese burger and aoli parmesan fries."}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had and their truffle fries is out of this world! I'll definitely go here again on my next vegas vacation."}
{"text":"Have been to Planet Hollywood  five times, and usually have lunch in Planet Dailies(will write review for that later).....there is usually an insane line for entry to BurGR, and that is plain stupid.....it is a very good burger, but not a great one.  We ate at about 11:45 pm, all of us were there for the USN GVI and had been traveling all day.  No wait, and they accommodated two of us who showed up 45 minutes later, which was unexpected and very cool.  Had the \"American Burger\" American cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion....and I added bacon(came to about $15.00) protein style, no bun.  Very juicy tasty burger....i just can't give a burger place a four star recommendation when there is so much damned attitude flying around.  The manager was great, very helpful, but everyone else from our server to the people bringing drinks seemed to want to be somewhere else.  I would return, for sure.  It was a decent meal at a time of day I wasn't expecting to eat and the prices were fair.....but not cheap for sure."}
{"text":"The location is inside the Planet Hollywood. I have to say they have the most amazing burgers, it is little pricy, but I would say it is worth it. You have to wait in a line on weekends usually, but I still love their food."}
{"text":"The onion rings were amazing.  The French fries and fish sandwich are good.  There was a wait but not to long for a party of two."}
{"text":"Feels like I actually should give my husband and my experience two stars but I think that would be too harsh and that I'm only being so critical because we went in with HIGH expectations.  Obviously Gordon isn't the one cooking the food or managing the restaurants but my goodness there were rookie mistakes made at every turn.    First off there was a decently long wait for just my husband and I, granted it was Valentine's day during the prime dinner time rush, but still with no where to sit down and a bunch of hosts that didn't even try to present a friendly demeanor, I'm counting that as strike 1.  After we were sat, our waitress came over in a fairly quick manner but was horrible at reading social cues and just conversing with us, not sure if she was new or just had a hard time hearing us because it was fairly noisy.  The burgers are extremely overpriced and come a la carte so my husband and I had to pick just one side to share because one order of fries is enough to feed three to four people.  We waited what seemed like quite awhile for food and when it finally arrived I was devastated.  Everything was cold, both burgers and fries were luke warm at best.  Normally I would not complain but I got the Hell's Kitchen burger ($15 I think) that is served with cold avocado which just made me feel like I was eating a burger leftover out of the fridge.  Our waitress was kind enough to get me a new one but it still tasted \"dead\" (sat in the window for much too long) and was honestly pretty bland.  Our sweet potato fries were even worse.  They come dusted with powder sugar which I had requested left off but I received fries sprinkled with sugar anyways.  Not to mention they were stone cold.  The honey mayo or whatever that awful dipping sauce they came with was terrible, we asked for some ketchup and ranch.    All in all, don't waste your money here.  The service was poor, the food was lackluster.  In the words of Gordon Ramsay...\"damn, damn, damn\" (in a British accent of course).  If you are ever in Seattle and want a Burger that will knock your socks off, venture in and order ANY burger from Lunchbox Laboratory."}
{"text":"We were a little hesitant about this place because of the price of the burgers and they were a la cart....but I am glad we face it a try.   By far the best burger I ever had in my life!   Would definitely visit again on my next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Omg wow! This place is incredibly amazing! Our waiter Christian was extremely attentive and helpful, he was SO on it, a real professional! We had a few apps and two burgers: the poppers , onion rings, farm burger, and I had the euro burger. All were fucking fabulous. The house Cabernet was also delicious, I don't think you can wrong here. Wonderful food and a wonderful waiter made our experience top notch and I will recommend it to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Best Ghoddamn burger I've ever had. As a burger expert, I give this place a 5 star rating. Had the American Burger medium and truffle fries...DEAD!"}
{"text":"The burger was perfect and the flavor best in class.  It was fun watching the staff work together as I sat at the bar.  Well worth the Gordon Ramsey name on the door."}
{"text":"Like everyone else here, had to try Gordons restaurant. We went last Monday night and had to wait 30 minutes, not too bad. Loved the atmosphere and decor. I had the British burger, medium rare, with english cheddar, arugula, and mango chutney. The burger is beautifully presented, the bun is gorgeous , looks at first like its alot of bread for the burger but everything was stacked just perfect. The bun is very light and doesnt overtake the rest of the flavors at all. Nice combination of flavor. Great selection of beer and wine chosen through an Ipad menu.Be sure to order the truffle fries....they were so great."}
{"text":"My aunt who frequently comes out to Vegas, recommended this place to me. I'm glad she did. Obvious the name Gordon Ramsay draws you to this establishment, but the food is actually pretty good.  I live here in Phoenix so I know good burger places like Roaring Fork, Delux, Paradise Valley burger, Rehab Burger, etc.  Gordon Ramsay BurgR would be very comparable and on that level.  We stopped by this place, its in the Planet Hollywood Casino.  We waited like 15 minutes and was seated promptly.  We ordered some truffle fries and I ordered the Farm Burger and my girlfriend ordered the Hell Kitchen burger.  Both were around 13 to 14 bucks and the fries were 10.  A little pricey, but Delux in Scottsdale, isn't much cheaper.  It's Vegas though.   One thing I did enjoy is, they have foundation drink Mountain Dew.  I don't get the chance to drink that often, but it tasted really good on that day.  I probably asked for 3 or 4 refills.  Overall the burgers were cooked to order, had a great taste and the fries were hot and flavorful.  Overall, if you want a decent burger with fries, give this place a try while you're out in Vegas.  The milk shakes did look good, but we didn't have the room to split one.  The service and food was on point, great experience, I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Good burger. I was expecting ahi tuna burgers or shrimp burgers with crazy sauces. The menu was really beef focused. I had the asian inspired burger with hoisin glaze and pork belly. I gave it 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"I would have given BurGR 5 stars, but I had to give them 4 because our reservation got \"lost\" when the host put it down in the tablet. We were told it would be an hour wait, which was fine, but after almost 1.5 hrs, we went to the restaurant and she had no record of party. BUT, thankfully the food was so good, it erased that from our minds. The truffle fries are awesome, but the burgers are bliss - truly the best burger I've had flavor and juicy wise. The flavor of the meat was incredible. The toasted bun was great as well. I was so full I didn't get to have the sticky toffee pudding push up pop that I wanted, but shucks, I'll just have to plan to return to Vegas some day soon so I can have one! Keep up the good work at BurGR!"}
{"text":"Let me preface the review by saying I travel frequently around the US for work. I have eaten at many hamburger joints, dives, iron chef voted best in America, franchised owned, backyard BBQ's and all the likes.   Burgr is by far hands down what I measure all other hamburgers by.  I have been here twice and both times surpassed my expectations despite ordering the same dish... The Hell's Kitchen Burger (medium rare) and the Truffle Parmesan fries.   On my last visit I started with the Roasted Jalapeño Peppers. Each one is in a shot glass with cheddar and ranch sauce. One of them is left with the seeds for sort of spicy Russian Roulette. Since I eat on the spicy side I ask for all of them to have the seeds left in them. For me at least it takes 3-4 to bring on the heat but they are amazingly tasty.   The Hell's Kitchen Burgr is grilled over Apple & Adler Wood.  The smokey taste comes through the meat right away. Then Mexican Asadero cheese is paired with roasted jalapeños and roasted tomato. Fresh avocado is added with its creamy goodness. This is the most tender burger I have ever had. It virtually melts in your mouth with the complexity of the spiciness coming from the peppers and the sweetness of the roasted tomato. The Asadero cheese is naturally on the salty side which ties in all the flavors. Each bite is a slice of meat heaven.   The hand cut Truffle Parmesan fires are served with truffle salt, truffle parmesan and truffle aioli. The fires are not greasy at all and it's enough for two or three to share. The truffle aioli sauce is to die for and the ketchup with caramelized onions gives you the options your mouth desires. It takes the art of fries to a whole new level.    The line on a Friday or Saturday for two people is a minimum 30 minutes upwards to an hour.  If you are a party of 3 or more, bypass the line and go straight to the hostess.  They will take your name down and text you when your table is ready.   The drinks menu is presented to you on a iPad as well as you bill is on iTouch. Also while in line you can explore the menu on their touch screen monitor outside. When you see the line you might ask yourself \"is it worth it?\" Trust me it is and you won't be disappointed.   One small tip is to avoid the standard cocktails.  Compared to Las Vegas pricing where they are practically giving the stuff away everywhere you look, the beer is far much better and reasonably priced.  If you don't mind eating at the bar, grab an open seat and you won't have to wait in line for this culinary experience.   Trust me on this one, the Gordon Ramsey name is not all hype. It meets all the expectations you would expect from an establishment with his name attached to it. I hope you enjoy your meal here as much as I do because this is a definite must have when I'm in town."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating at a Gordon Ramsay establishment and it definitely will not be my last!  Since we had a party of 4 and there was a wait, we put our name on the list and received a text when our table was ready.  We were able to walk around for about 20 minutes and then headed back when we got our text.  The head trainer (?) I think that was what he called himself was our waiter and he was PHENOMENAL.  You could tell he was very passionate about his job, answered all our questions, gave great recommendations and served us excellently.  We ended up ordering the special hog burger, hell's kitchen burger, euro and earth burgers.  The hell's kitchen was freakin amazing and the hog burger was delish.   I didn't get to taste the euro and earth burgers, but was told they were good.  We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries and OMG... they were spectacular.  Very tasty!  We also ordered shake #5 (coffee shake, hazelnut pudding, praline cookie) and it tasted as amazing as it looked!  Can't wait to go back next time I'm in vegas.  Food and service was top-notch!"}
{"text":"This is the second Ramsay restaurant I've been to an this one was more disappointing than the first. I'm not going to say this is a bad restaurant, it's just not what I expect from Gordon Ramsay.  The Good - The restaurant is very nice and the staff (and their small uniforms) is beautiful. The burger was good, but not great. The Parmesan Truffle fries were very good, but the dipping sauce was mayo or ketchup, not very original.  The Bad - Burgr is at the entrance of a Planet Hollywood, therefore it is very close to the street. The day I ate, it was 32 degrees outside and they sat me at the bar, it was very cold, so I asked to move into the restaurant where it was warm. They moved me to a table 15 feet away where it was still very cold.   While the waitress was very good at her job, and gorgeous too, the kitchen was extremely slow. It took over 20 minutes to get my burger.  If the food came a little quicker or if the hostess staff was a little more accommodating, I would have given Burgr 4-Stars, but no such luck."}
{"text":"The food is good but I wonder how Ramsey feels about his staff putting on their makeup, eating doughnuts and using their cell phones at the reception desk because they still have 8 minutes before they open? No is \"looking alive\" to say the least! And one minute before they opened she was sure to spray her body spray all over. I just haven't seen so much done in front of customers at a restaurant before lol and shocked at a Gordon Ramsey's restaurant"}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the Euro Burger and my friend got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and we split them. Euro Burger was definitely the favorite! The buns are so soft and everything was cooked to perfection.   If you get the Just Fries with the two ketchups, ask for the cheddar ranch dip that comes with the onion rings. You won't regret it!  The service was amazingly friendly and attentive. They kept our waters filled!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a recent trip to Vegas, and while there were several pluses with few minuses, it didn't exactly wow. We only had to wait about 10 minutes before being seated, so no problems there. The food was good and the prices were in line with a Vegas eatery. My husband had the Farm burger and I had the Britannia, both were quite good and cooked to our requested temperature. Also got an order of the truffle fries, which were great on their own , but the curry ketchup really made them sing.   The biggest downside was the service; we were spared from being overly exposed to our server's Ben Stine-like personality by the simple fact that she was never at out table. We saw her a total of three times: to take our order, drop off the check, and to sign for the check (a different server brought our food). The place in general seemed to have that \"we're too cool for you\" vibe.  I definitely think Burgr is worth a visit, just not more than one."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's my new favorite burger joint in Vegas. The wait can be a little long, but there is usually seating at the bar. After being forced to watch Hell's Kitchen for so many seasons by my wife. I was excited to go to one of Ramsay's restaurant to see what the hype is about.  I believed the hype after I took a bite from my Hell's Kitchen burger. It was hot and fiery, and I couldn't stop eating it.  The ambience is hip and modern.  The menu has a good selection of burgers, hot dogs, and desserts.  The food is worth the wait.  The burgers aren't your average quarter pounders. They're thick and juicy patties of meat. The fries are of a generous  portion.  The price is surprisingly reasonable.    The staff are fast and friendly. They know the menu really well.  Definitely gonna be going back.  Notable mentions: the Hell's Kitchen burger, the American burger, and French fries."}
{"text":"Good. Not great. Surely not worth hr wait if there's a line.   Did not get a shake. Might have missed out there.   Fries were average. Wish we would have tried onion rings.   Reasonable pricing.   Good beer selection."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try Gordon Ramsay Food! He did not disappoint. The food was amazing. I order the Hell's Kitchen burger and oh my it was yummy. A little bit spicy. I also ordered the Parmesan fries which I give two thumbs up. I didn't order a shake but saw that everyone had one so I'm guessing they are yummy as well. Next time I'm back in Vegas I will definitely come back. However the wait time is long. About 40-60 minute wait on a Tuesday. So wear comfortable shoes to stand for a while."}
{"text":"First time in Vegas and what a great way to start the vacation than to head my my favorite chef's restaurant. The presentation was awesome and food was great. We got the truffle parmesan fries and a couple burgers. The fries were to die for but the burgers could have been just a little bit warmer in temperature."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan so when we were in Vegas I had to go to Burgr. What a great restaurant. During our meal it was time for a shift change and it was seamless. Our initial waiter, Elijah, made sure we were taken care of and met his replacement before leaving. Or server's assistant, Caleb, was amazing! The food was more than I expected it to be and I had very high expectations. While we were there the manager came and talked to us. He was very friendly and proud of his staff and the restaurant."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Gourmet burgers that were delicious along with their jalapeño poppers. Must try!"}
{"text":"The absolutely best burger I've ever had!  Medium rare like it's supposed to be, this place excels in delivering flavor!  The down side was the 1:30 wait."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas. Quick suggestion get there early, you never know when it's your turn to wait in line for 30 minutes. For two I would suggest sharing a burger and the sweet potato fries(they are delicious)."}
{"text":"For my first review of the year, I've reserved this spot for Gordon Ramsay BurGR. I'm a fan of Chef Gordon Ramsey and so I felt trying out this place during my recent Vegas trip was a must.   The restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood casino. We arrived at 6 p.m. on a weekend night and, as expected, there were already long lines forming. Honestly, I wished they could've done something to help organize the lines as it was very confusing. I jumped in one line only to be told it was the wrong line (that particular line was only for parties of 2. If you have more than 2, you gotta approach the hostess, announce the # of your party, and they will do a text service once your table is ready). Our wait for a party of 5 was 35 minutes so I guess in the end it wasn't too bad~   For an appetizer, we got the Honey-Pig Bao Buns ($13). Fresh, steamed buns filled with a delicious slab of tender roasted pork belly, cucumbers, radishes, cilantro and a honey-hoisin sauce - yummy!  The Truffle Parmesan fries ($11) was another delish appetizer/side. It seemed to be one of the more popular choices since almost every table had them. The fries were really unique in flavor; has an earthy-salty taste that was out-of-this-world good and came with 2 sauces. Portion was big enough to share for 4.   For my personal entree, I chose The Farm burger ($15). Settled on this because it has Duck Breast Bacon (whaat), a fried egg, and a heaping amount of English Sharp Cheddar piled on top - come on, who in their right mind would say no to this combination? The bacon...crispy, flavorful...and the perfectly runny fried egg, omg, the key to pulling everything together into one cohesive nirvanic bite - I can't, I just can't. The beef patty was cooked to a perfect, juicy medium and the presentation absolutely gorgeous. Truly, THE best burger I've had to date.   Sadly, despite the outstanding food, it was overshadowed by the lackluster service. Our waiter spilled drinks and broke a few glasses; it was a manageable mess, but he made it worse by swearing up a storm. So unexpected from this kind of establishment.   Aside from the service, I'm thankful to have discovered my current favorite burger. Definitely coming back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Went with 8 people during afternoon on wednesday and there was a line as usual, but the wait wasn't long.  Our waitress was slow and not as tentative as I would expect from a \"Gordan Ramsay\" restaurant.  The food took a long time to come out but it did come out all at once for all of us.  And paying for our bill took over 15 minutes.  Orders were some Hell's Kitchen burger and Farm burgers.  And we all agreed that these burgers were nothing special.  The patty itself was very plain.  For such a pricey burger, you would expect flavorful meal, but it was not.  Definitely not a place to return too.  I would give it a 2.5."}
{"text":"The Burger was such a delicious and amazing spot to go eat. Wish there was one close by house I would really enjoy it"}
{"text":"The wait wasn't too bad, and the burger and sweet potato fries made it worth it. The fries were probably the best I've ever had. Period. Dusted in a vanilla powdered sugar they were amazing. They also served a dipping sauce that had a kick to it. The burger was exceptional. I want to say I had the Farm Burger. I'd definitely go back. :)"}
{"text":"For some reason pay $100 for steak feels better than paying $21 for burger.  It's expensive and doesn't include fries.  It's not as good as I had expected but damn, it's good!"}
{"text":"The food is spot on perfect taste and presents on only make it better. Tip your hostess to get seated quicker and not wait in line...."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious here.  I always wanted to try out Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  There's always a line during dinner.  We waited maybe about 30-40 min for a table for two.  They probably could have sat people down sooner, since we saw quite a few open spots as we were being seated.  Larger groups had longer waits of course.  The Hell's Kitchen Burger was absolutely superb.  I actually enjoyed this burger better than any of the burgers I've had at Holstein's inside the Cosmopolitan.  The burger was so juicy and so flavorful, I absolutely loved it.  The Fury Chicken Wings were great too.  I loved how each had a little handle, made for easier devouring.  I loved the size and flavor of them, absolutely tasty and very spicy. Got the fries as well, this definitely was my least favorite.  Thick cut just isn't my thing for fries.  Our waiter was nice and checked in on us frequently.  Would definitely come back again.  Craving for the burger and wings again!"}
{"text":"Stellar. The fries are stunning.  Deserts look great if you have room.  If you want a show in the kitchen, go at a busy time and sit at the counter."}
{"text":"If this didn't have Gordon's name on it I don't think it would be as popular at all. Probably worth it to go once just to say you did.  Burger was pretty good, 8 bucks for fries is ridiculous at any place. Overall the restaurant was a bit dirty and the food was average."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside the casino in Planet Hollywood. The atmosphere is noisy, but this is worth dealing with because of the very excellent food choices as well as interesting drinks. Our server was so personable and knowledgeable about the menu that we tried some things we might not have if we'd not had her advice. The three of us started with some different beers and a wonderful whiskey lemonade cocktail. Then we tried an order of their onion rings. Presentation was beautiful and the taste was the best ever. We had two sauces served with the rings. Amazing! Our burgers were all different and beautifully served. Again, amazing taste! Definitely not your ordinary burgers! I know Gordon Ramsay's passion is taste, presentation, speed of service, and a manageable menu. He delivers excellence here! Everything coming out of the kitchen was beautifully served. We wanted to try an order of the Parmesan Truffle Fries and there were so many, along with two different sauces, that we could not finish them all. This just might have unexpectedly been the best dinner at a restaurant we've ever had.  I would definitely recommend this everyone coming to vegas wanting a phenomenal burger."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Modern styling. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices.   The burgers are great....that should be a given in a place named after burger. But what sets this place apart are the parmesan truffle fries and the milkshakes.    Right on the strip,  so it's a must go."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing... I had there mushroom burger, and it was hands down one of the best burgers I have ever had... I would strongly suggest eating here"}
{"text":"The truffle fries and sweet potato fries are ammmaazzzinng! They have so much flavor and the dipping sauces are good too. If you like spicy, I would definitely recommend getting the jalapeño poppers. I happened to get the one fiery surprise jalepeno that is hidden in one of the poppers. I like really spicy foods and that was pretty spicy. The burgers though we're good, but felt like it lacked a little bit of flavor in the chanterelle burger. Prices for the burgers may be a little steep but they have different types of unique ingredients that you won't find in a normal burger. I can't wait to come back here again to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"Definitely NOT worth it. The food was bland!  Gordon's idea of a limited menu may be nice but if the one main food on the menu is bland, then the entire restaurant is bland. The fries were also just blah. Parmesan fries should maybe have some garlic or something. These were just salty so you had to dip it into the garlic aoili sauce to get flavor and cut the salt. but the aoli sauce is just glorified mayo. Nothing healthy here. And what's with the fire display. That is totally wasting a very limited resource of natural gas. I'm NOT a fan. Even hubby, a burger lover, says that Slater's 50-50 burger in San Diego is miles ahead on flavor and quality. My advice to Gordon, get some flavor in your meat and your fries. Oh yes, the beer selections were good. I enjoyed the hard cider, yum. Best part of my meal."}
{"text":"Second time here, and has been 3 years since the last time...... The same great food, and quality. Who knew burgers could be made into a gourmet meal? Their chicken wings also delicious! The most amazing French Fries (chips for Aussies and POM's), truly delicious combinations! Great service. Be early or late as the dinner slots create quite a wait!1 You won't be sorry you tried this great restaurant"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch hell burger for sure is my hands down favorite. Must try and highly recommended if you haven't already"}
{"text":"One of the better burgers I have had, the meat was cooked just as asked, the fries were crispy and not too salty, but the check was big. Our total was 90 bucks for 4 burgers and 1 fries. The farm burger was pretty good, I felt it was better than the hells kitchen burger. The food was 5 star, but the value for money was less on my eyes.  The host at the front desk couldn't hold our table for a couple more minutes which was not what I expected... When we got a table, it had enough place and the rest of our party just sat in. Food came out fairly quick for how busy they seemed"}
{"text":"Obviously I was not disappointed! Me and my husband are obsessed with Hell's Kitchen so of course by some miracle I was hoping to see Chef Ramsey or Christina... maybe our next visit. The fury wings are soooo good! The sauce is spicy but sweet and who doesn't like blue cheese. The uber cheese burger is perfect.. and you have to try the gooey fries (we never wanted it to end) I would definitely recommend coming here and coming back. But I also want to try Ramsey's other restaurants in vegas."}
{"text":"Made a last minute decision to come here for brunch at open and so glad we did! We were a 4 top at open and were sat pretty quickly. The restaurant set up was clean and interesting. The food was fantastic, with all of us ordering different menu items. I wish we were there longer to try out other things. And compared to other LV restaurants, it was all very affordable and reasonably priced. I would definitely recommend going there earlier as we always saw a line there, especially at peak times. Hi, Gordon!"}
{"text":"Wow.. First time at Gordon Ramsay's Burgr and was it the best. A new comer to live in Vegas sat next to us. I suggested the fries because the wait for the burger was long. I shared a few fries and a slice of my burger and surprised to find out she paid our bill. Wow!! Thank you from Texas should you ever see this review! Our waitress Michelle was so nice and suggested the best truffle burger I devoured. Richard was amazing too and offered us the special July 4th pops after we orders the pudding pops. How much more amazing could we have had without amazing service and sweet people. I came today expecting long lines and regular burgers with okay service. However, we were overwhelmed with surprises and exceptional service. Would have loved to see some shouting in the kitchen and maybe Gordon Ramsay. Hope to one day come back.BTW... Best seats are at the cooks station where all the fun begins and ends."}
{"text":"Interesting to say the least!  Tourist trap at best.  Just to be clear, the \"Roasted Jalapeno Poppers\" did not appear to be roasted as the menu and name would suggest, they actually appeared to be fried.  6 jalapenos served in separate glasses, each half filled with a sauce were indeed tasty.  The promise of a hot surprise went unfulfilled - none of the poppers was anywhere close to being hot.  That's not to say the poppers weren't good, they just weren't \"as advertised.\"  GR should give me a call - I've got a killer roasted popper's recipe.  The burgers were good, tasty, but not worth the price.  The fries were typical steak fries, not bad, and again, way overpriced.  So, $85 later, (including the tip) my bride & I had two burgers, two drinks, a side of fries and an appetizer, which is a bit more than spendy for a burger joint, even a great burger joint.  I'd be a fan of BurGR if it wasn't for being so overpriced.  As it is, it's okay.  I'll try some other places next time out."}
{"text":"YUM! A big group of my friends were visiting Vegas last weekend, and we all really wanted to try this place. We went on a Saturday, and we didn't make a reservation, so we were really scared that our party of 12 would have to wait a looong wait. We all arrived around 5pm, and we waited for less than 30min for our table! :)  The majority of our group ordered the Farm Burger and we got 4 orders of Truffle Parmesean Fries for our group to share. Fries don't come with the burgers themselves and are sold separately, but one order can definitely be shared by 4 people or so. These fries were really goood. The Farm Burger had duck breast bacon and a fried egg in it. Mm, the bacon was hella good and the egg was perfect! I cut my burger in half, and the egg started to ooze, but it's great with the burger.   What was also handy was that the bill came with a calculator! Hahaha, that was actually pretty handy for us since we had a big group. So, if you're in Vegas and want a good burger, go here!! Good food, good service and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Burgers are really good. I had the one with egg and duck breast.  Onion rings batter was nice and light. Service is a good but not awesome. Food took a little bit long to come."}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit Burgr! big fan of Gordon Ramsay.  Service was ok.  Food was ok. burger came out cold. Price was ... err.. once a year is ok... not cheap.  Was I expecting too much ?"}
{"text":"You have to admit, Gordon Ramsay is pretty entertaining to watch on TV. I love his passion and extreme ways and being able to see it all that on TV is just so addicting!  When the BurGR restaurant finally opened in PH, I just so happen to be staying at PH so I decided to give the place a try.  While walking around some time in the hotel, this place always seems to be packed! The line sometimes stretches out to the casino.  We went when it was kind of dying and didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes for a table.  I really liked the concept of their restaurant.  The cool presentation of the menu and setting. The Ipad featuring all their eclectic drinks and desserts. Overall, it was all pretty cool.  The server was really friendly and did a wonderful job of explaining the menu and suggesting some popular items.  We tried the jalapeno popper shooters, parmesan fries, Farm Burger and Hell's Kitchen Burger. When the jalapeno popper shooters came, it was a fun little game to play while waiting for your entree. However, when the BF and I were playing russian roulette with our appetizers, when we finished all the poppers, we looked stunned at each other because we couldn't determine who had the \"spicy\" popper.  They all tasted the same. Not hot at all! It was kind of a let down.  The Farm Burger was good.  Nothing too spectacular.  I did however like the egg was cooked perfectly. I cut my burger in half and was able to see the yellow yolk running down.  The BF's Hell's Kitchen burger was ok. It wasn't spicy at all.  For an extreme chef, I'm surprised he would tone down his food that much.  I would expect Chef Ramsay to produce some HOT HOT HOT food to match his HOT HOT HOT personality.  Overall, this place was ok.  I'm glad I was able to try it. Seeing the menu beforehand and finally being able to try it, I was kind of disappointed that Chef Ramsay didn't deliver on his food."}
{"text":"Wasabi wings are bomb! Food came out a little slow but it was so good! Worth stopping for sure."}
{"text":"Our burgers and fries were good but definitely not worth the price. On top of that, service was terrible. Not only did our food take forever to arrive, our server, Ginger, was unprofessional and awfully inattentive. She never came to check up on our table. When she did finally show up with the bill, she made it seem like we were wasting her time."}
{"text":"My favorite meal will always be steak and baked potato but the second thing on the list for my last supper would have to be a hamburger. An amazing, juicy, hamburger. We came here on a Saturday afternoon. Tables of 3 or less are asked to wait in a line to the side, while bigger parties must check in with the hostess for tables. We had two in our party and one of the hostesses said the wait in line would be about 15 minutes, but it ended up being closer to the 30 minute mark. I was hANGRY and grumpy, but I was glad we waited.   The server Alex said he would rank his favorite burgers accordingly: 1. The Farm Burger 2. The Blue Burger 3. The Hell's Kitchen Burger  We decided we would try the Jalapeno poppers, the Farm Burger and the Hell's Kitchen Burger cooked medium rare. To complete the experience, we also ordered shake  #3 with the butterscotch pudding and banana shake with snicker-doodle cookie.  The milkshake came out first. It was tall and grand, just like the taste. It came out with two straws and the cookie on top. The cookie was chewy and thin, a spin on the traditional snicker-doodle but still equally as yummy; simple and small, but a great addition to the shake. The shake was thick and creamy. I didn't know how to feel about the pudding being inside the shake but they went so well together!  When the Jalapeno poppers came out, I was expecting some Jack-in-the-box looking poppers in a red basket lined with red and white paper. Nope, these were definitely gourmet poppers. They tasted even better than they were presented. Each were placed in a separate glass that held dipping sauce. If separating out the poppers doesn't communicate greatness, I don't know what will! Seriously I could have made a meal on these alone. The breaded outside withstood any bite you took and didn't crumble nor fall apart. They weren't too spicy and they weren't scalding hot on the inside (I've burned my mouth on several Jack-in-the-box poppers). The cheese had hints of bacon flavors and they were absolutely delicious.  The Farm burger was my favorite of the two burgers we tried and it came out with an over-easy egg. Once the yoke was popped, the party was started. Every bite tasted SO GOOD. I imagined the duck bacon would stand out, yet it just blended well with the burger together. The medium rare patty combined with the cheese, bacon, egg and perfect bun was absolutely fabulous!  The Hell's Kitchen Burger was good as well. It had cheese, avocado, tomatoes and peppers.  My date thought the peppers were too strong in flavor and took away from the burger. I agreed. It was a very tasty burger, but once you've had a bite of the Farm burger, it makes you reevaluate what you think a good burger is.  The service was phenomenal. Our server was so friendly and energetic as was the hostess who seated us. Our waters were never even half empty because they were constantly refilled. Good service and incredibly delicious food. I definitely will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was amazing! Greeting with a smile by several very cute hostesses & immediately seated. Cute server came right over and was very knowledgable of the menu & very attentive the whole evening. I had the Hells Kitchen burger which was one of the best burgers I've ever had. Burger prices are about $14 & are ala carte. Service was very prompt & friendly. Will definitely return & bring friends."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this place!   Went late.. had to stand in line.. but went pretty fast.   We both order the hamburgers. They were large and a bit too fancy for us. The bacon was unusual for me and tasted weird.  The truffle fries were not my fav. Reality didn't taste the truffle.  I was a little disappointed that we weren't happy with our food and to pay that much for it was also a bummer!  I prefer just a good beef hamburger."}
{"text":"As I follow all the Gordon Ramsay's TV shows, I visit this place quiet often when I have a chance. This place never disappointed. Jalapeño poppers were my favorite, first time it disappointed me because they were over fried. Waiter We got had a bad attitude. Wait time is pretty long, need to be patient."}
{"text":"Food: Great burgers!!! Ordered the southern yard Burger and tried the Fish n crisp sandwich. Both great options.  Service: great service even though get prepared to wait at least a minimum of 45 minutes.   I'm not a huge fan of burgers but damn that was good. I can see why people go crazy over his food. If you're here you should definitely check it out. There's plenty of bars around there so you can go have a drink while you wait."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had (\"Euro burger\").  If you like blue cheese, the Euro burger was absolutely fantastic.  We split a Euro burger and  a \"Three-cheese burger\" so we could try a bit of each and the three-cheese was great too, but  I'd go with the Euro overall.  We also split an order of the yam fries, which came with powdered sugar and a honey-jalapeno dipping sauce that was quite tasty  (the order is huge, so you'll want to split it).    I had the caramel pudding chocolate shake for dessert and it was very unique.  Thick caramel pudding on top and chocolate shake all the way down.  I thought it was very good.  We would definitely come back here any time we are in Vegas.  Loved it."}
{"text":"BurGR is located right in the lobby of Planet Hollywood. This place was a fun place to dine, starting from the fiery display at the front entrance to the menu, which you are able to keep as a souvenir. They have a great selection of appetizers and burgers, all of which sound amazing. I had the chanterelle mushroom burger, and also tried some of the farm burger, both of which were absolutely delicious. Both had perfectly cooked meats, the farm burger had an awesome fried egg, and the buns for the burgers are also really good. We ordered 1 order of fries for 3 people, which was more than plenty, as the burgers are quite filling and the fries are very heavy, but delicious. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Burger Joint, burgers done right!! I had the Farm Burger, Truffle Fries & Onion Rings. All very reasonably priced. Nothing frozen and everything homemade - it all met my expectations!!"}
{"text":"Soo... This place would receive a 5star if the hostess girl (black hair) tonight wasn't such a B**** to us. She was rude and unorganized.  My parents and I were excited to try the place out. Overall, this place is a wonderful burger place. Ramsey's burgers are not a disappointment, they were delicious! I hope to try the fries next time.  Farm burger- delicious and perfectly medium rare! A must try!  Jalapeño Hell's Kitchen burger- good as well, I enjoy the farm burger more. Not really spicy.  Hog burger- didn't try, my dad said it was excellent, they scarfed it up! I have to try it some time.   I will definitely return :) and hopefully not run into the cranky, unorganized chick."}

Not me! Not when I have the egg porn yolk leaking slowly down my burger...mmm...  Service was meh, they never brought over enough spoons. Always like 4 for 6 people. Then they weren't even the long spoons for the shake like we requested. Plus the all over the place attitude. For a GR spot I expected a little better!  They also sat us in one of the coldest indoor spot for a restaurant ever. Right next to the doors that people were constantly coming through to get to the hotel. Maybe they could add a space heater in the area so we can enjoy our meal without freezing!  For the price and taste though, definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow doesn't even begin to describe how impressed I was with this place. Luckily for my boyfriend and I, having a party of two gets you seated quicker, although we still had to wait for about 20 minutes.    I ordered the Chanterelle Burger, which consisted of Chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, and figgy-onion jam. Honestly, before I had this burger, the description wasn't that appealing to me, especially the part about the jam. I typically don't like mixing sweet flavors with savory ones, and I was skeptical about how the jam would taste in the burger.  But so many people on Yelp RAVED about it so I figured it couldn't be that bad. When I finally took that first bite, all my worries dissolved. This burger was amazing!!! Even now, the Chanterelle burger is my favorite of all burgers I have ever tried.  The meat, the bun, the ingredients, everything was just so perfect! The truffle fries were pretty good too, although a little pricey.    Will I ever find a burger better than this one? Possibly. But for now, this burger has captured my heart and tongue, and it will be very difficult to find another burger as fine and magnificent as this."}
{"text":"Let me ,just say, I am a true sucker for a great burger & mac n' cheese!   I watch way too many Gordon Ramsey show, so expectations of his restaurant is pretty high.  We waited for about 30mins for seats.  When we actually got seated, the server was truly just amazing.  He was super informative about the entire menu, gave some recommendations and just continued to make sure that we enjoyed our experience there, and we did!   Burgers:  Hell's Kitchen Burger $13 (shoot!  I had to order this medium well because I was sharing w/a friend   I wish the jalapeno peppers had a little more of a kick to it.  But overall, this is the best burger I have ever had) asadero cheese + roasted jalapeño peppers + avocado + oven roasted tomato   Greens & Salad: Kale Granny-Apple Caesar Salad $11 (nothing special, just a good Caesar salad)  parmigiano-reggiano cheese + mini herb-garlic croutons  Fries:  Truffle Parmesan Fries $10 (nothing special, but the fries should not be wedges.  Didn't quite taste the truffles in here) hand cut fries + truffle parmesan + truffle salt + truffle aioli  Of course, I will come back here if I was in Vegas.  My rating was really based on the Burger, environment and service which was a great experience."}
{"text":"Is it worth the wait? ... Not really, but is the food good?   Definitely not too bad for one of many Gordon Ramsey branded restaurants.   First come first served restaurant in planet Hollywood. Truffle fries are to die for and Cesar Apple salad portion is big and flavorful.  Great fantastic service by the waiters. Paul was our waiter and definitely made the experience wonderful by trying his best to accommodate our needs."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally made it there! We waited about 30 min to be seated on a Saturday for lunch but it was totally worth it. I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger and it was soo delicious! Loved it so much my husband and I went back the next day to try their hot dogs and jalapeño poppers! Would personally go back for burgers and truffle fries!"}
{"text":"Recently went to this place because I'm a fan of Ramsay (the chef not the guy from Game of Thrones) - burger was impressive. I purchased the special at the time, it was around 16 dollars without fries.   The gourmet burger had avocados and other ingredients that work well together. The waiter even offered me a free birthday shot!   Aside from the burger, I ordered the pork belly bun appetizer. It had a nice unique taste to it. I definitely suggest this appetizer, though it is very small.   The price is more on the expensive side, but this is a gourmet burger place in Vegas, so I expected as much.   There's also people that take your picture to try to sell you an expensive image of yourself eating. I thought this practice was strange but I enjoyed the image so it did not ruin dinner.   There are still a few things I want to try from this place, so I will be visiting them again when I can. I am wanting to try the truffle burger and the shredder pork burger."}
{"text":"After our hour long wait, I must've been cranky or something because I was really disappointed with the overall experience here. I was debating between 2 or 3 stars and after much debate, I finally landed on 2 stars...here's why.  The restaurant itself is pretty cool and I love the open kitchen concept. Having a little iPad to play with and peruse the menu is also very cool but the darn thing ended up being more of a pain than useful. It was difficult to get from section to section and the novelty quickly wore off.    Aside from our long wait, the visit actually started off great. We had a friendly, super sweet and upbeat waitress who was fantastic. We ordered the jalepeno poppers as an appetizer to the share amongst the 4 of us dining here.  They leave the seeds in one of the six poppers in to make it fun for those dining and sadly, I didn't get it - I love spicy. The poppers were nice and crispy on the outside and inside was stuffed with creamy cheese.  The dipping sauce it was served it was fantastic!  I wish I could get the recipe to that baby because it was one of the highlights of the meal.   For my entree, I ordered the farm burger which came with duck breast bacon, a fried egg, and sharp cheddar cheese. And for the table we ordered the famous truffle fries. As expected, I loved the truffle fries and the dipping sauces that came with were very tasty. The problem that I had was with the burger. I had asked for it to be medium but when I got it, my fried egg was way overcooked.  The waitress was kind enough to have the kitchen remake it but when I got my burger back, the egg was still more done than I would've liked as well as the burger patty itself. Remember, I ordered it medium and it ended up being more well done.   Gordon Ramsay is an internationally renowned chef who has trained alongside greats such as Guy Savoy and Joël Robuchon and he opens a burger joint??  Some of his restaurants have received 3 michelen stars but yet....here, his staff could not get a fried egg, nor a burger done right?  This makes me believe that this restaurant is purely a money maker for him because I felt ripped off and was disappointed that I bought into the hype.  Clearly, I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional .  Sabrina knew our needs before we requested.  The farm burger was good but not great.  Not worth the 45 minute wait time for lunch ."}
{"text":"Four star review here because the burgers were amazing and our boys LOVED the shakes.  I do think Gordon needs to show up and whip his hostess staff into shape, because they were amazingly incompetent.  When we arrived there were 2 parties in front of us and no less than 5 hostesses trying to figure out how to seat these two parties in a half-full restaurant.  Apparently \"the computer\" wouldn't let them seat the parties.  And, not one of them seemed to have the brains to just handle it manually.  I have to believe Gordon would have been appalled.  Once we got seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for our waiter to appear - again, the restaurant was probably half full.  But, four stars because the burgers were just that good.  I had the Blue burger, my husband had the farm burger and one son had the hell's kitchen burger.  All were excellent.  The truffle fries were also amazing.  And our boys had the decadent shake with the crème brulee pudding on top.    Come hungry...and you'll still leave stuffed, but pack your patience to get in."}
{"text":"If I were to rate Burgr 4 years ago, I would give it 5 stars.  The poppers were amazing as well as the drinks and burgers.  4 years later, when the wifey and I returned to Vegas Burgr it was on our short list of places to eat.  Unfortunately, it was not as great.  I think maybe Gordon should check it out himself.  The chairs were dirty.  Menus were worn.  The wait was long.  Too long for the ultimate experience.  After biting into the burger, we asked ourselves is this really a $21 burger?  Nope.  I don't mean to be dramatic but Red Robin or Applebees has a better burger.  Maybe we caught them on an off night, but I don't think so.  The whole experience seemed to be processed and overdone.  The fries were overdone.  The sauce that came with the fries had a slight crust on it like jt had been sitting for awhile.  My Martini was great.  The food not so much."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this: I'm not trying to insult anyone, but don't ever wait more than 45 minutes to be seated at a restaurant..that specializes in BURGERS. That's dumb. Go somewhere else.   One word to describe this place: Unimpressive.   Whenever I hear the name Gordon Ramsay, I immediately think of Kitchen Nightmares. I think of the way he tries to help places improve the quality of their service, food, and overall experience. Well, Gordon Ramsay needs to help his OWN restaurant out. Here's why...  I was actually considering giving this place one star, but then I remembered that I enjoyed my glass of wine. I was part of a party of 7 people, and we went to BurGR because the birthday girl had been there before and loved it.   The whole wait thing was solved by someone heading there and putting our name down, and saying we would go at a certain time. We only waited about 10 minutes for our party to be seated. The server was really nice and accommodating - he brought over two iPads (COOL!) and explained the drinks to our party.   We ordered the jalapeño poppers and truffle parmesan fries to start off. Jalapeño poppers were not impressive, but the presentation was nice. They were placed in shot glasses of ranch, so I thought that was pretty cool. Were they absolutely delicious? No. The truffle parmesan fries were another story. They were completely laughable. They were too soft - the only crispy fries were the burnt ones at the bottom. Already off to a bad start... Everyone in my party ordered a different burger: American, Hell's Kitchen, Farm, etc. I ordered the Euro Burger.    The perfect word to describe my burger: Unimpressive. Nothing about it was great. It has truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and \"oven roasted tomato.\" LOL. Stupid. The meat itself was not flavorful and the different ingredients didn't help the burger at all.   Let's talk about SERVICE now.   If my party is paying $20+ a person for a BURGER, I better have the BEST fucking service imaginable. HOLY SHIT. I cannot believe that people would come back to this place. I've had better service at the Denny's on the strip. To me, service is one of the most important aspects of a restaurant, and this place was completely lacking. Our server got changed about 15 minutes after we were seated and we had someone who lacked the customer service skills necessary to work at a restaurant that is so incredibly pretentious.   Another thing that REALLY bothered me was the fact that AFTER waiting 45 minutes to get our food they fucked up our order. Someone in my party was left with no food. The girl who brought our food came around with an extra American burger, and after we told her that it's not what our friend ordered, she gave us an attitude and walked away mad. WHAT THE FUCK. We weren't rude about it - all we said was \"That's not what he ordered.\" HER: Are you sure? No. We're not sure. We have fucking dementia. That was the server who wrote the order down wrong.   To top it off, all the manager did was walk over and say \"Oh. Sorry. I'll tell the kitchen to make your food right now.\" UMM. Yes. Let's ALL finish our burgers and watch our friend eat air. He didn't even offer him an appetizer, or say, \"Hey! Burger's on us. Sorry about that.\" To me, that's a fucking joke.   One thing I noticed too - if a manager has to walk around and apologize that food is taking so long and that his servers are not being attentive... YOU HAVE A PROBLEM. A manager should NOT have to walk around and make excuses for anyone. FIX YOUR SHIT.   If all you care about is taking a picture and tagging yourself at this place, then by all means, go here. If you want bad service, meh food, and be able to look at your drink menu on an iPad, then COME HERE. As for me? Sorry. I'd like to think that I have better taste in places. I would never come back here again. The service SUCKED. The food was blah. And the prices were ridiculous.   This place is just too hyped up and is not for me. A name doesn't make a place."}
{"text":"I had the Britannia burger, the rest of my party had the Hell's Kitchen, Farm Burger, and American. Each of us thought it was quite possibly the best burger we've ever had. You can't go wrong!  We tried all three fries. The Parmesan trouffle is definitely the best. The sweet potato fries were really good, but sweet--powdered sugar and a sweet dipping sauce--which I wasn't expecting. The Parmesan fries' dipping sauces were incredible!  Creme brûlée Oreo shake was to die for. If you thought you were going somewhere else for dessert, think again!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Would go again in a second!  Got the farm house burger and sweet potato fries.  Best I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and my sister and her husband last weekend and had a great experience!  The wait on a Monday night was 45 minutes but it was pretty neat that they text you when your table is ready.  The service is fantastic -- the waiters are very well educated on their menu and you never have to ask for a refill.  We had the Honey Pork Belly Buns and Jalapeno Poppers for appetizers.  I really enjoyed the Pork Belly Buns a lot -- I loved the subtle Asian taste and the flavors balanced really well.  I liked the Jalapeno Poppers too but I thought that the sauce they came with was a little too creamy -- and also I believe there was melted Cheddar Cheese inside the popper as opposed to Cream Cheese which is more traditional.  There could've been Cream Cheese as well -- but I could mostly taste the Cheddar.  For dinner my sister and I both ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which was delicious.  I wish it had been more spicy (given it's name) but it was delicious none-the-less.  My husband and brother-in-law both ordered the Farm Burger which was also delicious -- the fried egg added a nice touch.  I love that you can get your burgers grilled to your liking (although for $15 per burger, that's the least they can do).  We also had the Parmesan Truffle Fries which were DELICIOUS.  I could've made a meal just out of those.  All in all, while we had a really great experience, I don't think we'd go back the next time we're in Vegas because a) it wasn't out of this world and b) there are just too many places to try in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Passes for well made burger could be a tad bigger for the price.  The Onion oil rings needed help..was drowning in oil.  Good service."}
{"text":"In n out beats this place hands down. I don't understand what is so special abt hells kitchen burger and the chicken burger had bones in the patty. Truffle fries were good. I don't understand what's the hype abt this place. Never going back."}
{"text":"WOW!! My reaction after eating here. A must order burger on their menu is the Farm Burger and their Truffle Fries. Must say it is the best burger i have had in a long time.   Only down side is the wait it is alway busy, but for a reason."}
{"text":"I had the Hell's Kitchen burger. Let's just say it was HOT. I guess it lived up to the \"hell\" part with the jalapeño peppers. It was actually really good. I also had the Shake #2, the coconut pudding strawberry shake with chocolate cookie. It was top 2 shakes I have ever had. I also had the Parmesan fries. I really enjoyed the food, but it was a really rich combo. Not to mention about $34 for a burger, fries, & a shake. But, it's Gordon Ramsay, you pay for the name. It's worth it though. I like how they present the drinks, on an I-pad. First place I have ever had that. The service was really good. It's in a great location on the strip, pretty much the middle, right inside the front door of Planet Hollywood. I went at about 2, so the lunch crowd was pretty much gone. I went by at noon, wow, lie up was about 30 deep, on a Tuesday. I'm not one for waiting in lines."}
{"text":"First I love GR! I was/am so excited to get to eat here. I ordered the Britannia burger, which had mango chutney, cheddar and arugala. It was delicious but unfortunately it wasn't cooked consistently through out (very pink on one side and well on the other side). My son got the Hell's kitchen burger, which he said had the heat but didn't actually taste like jalapeno. The fancy ketchup with the fries... curry and chipotle weren't my chip of tea but my son liked the chipotle. Service was great.atmosphere was really nice.  I will come again!"}
{"text":"$50 for two burgers and fries!?.. Really. Talk about over charging. Presentation was good. Food was ok, it was after all just a burger with an egg in it. That is the farm burger I got. The truffle fries came out a little soggy. The hell's kitchen burger had no taste at all. Just a neat party with jalapeños. Really. We paid $15 for a burger that had no flavor. Absolutely disappointed with this.   Bottom line, would I go back?  Only if you paid for it.  I wouldn't waste my money here, in n out burger with light well fries own this place.   Expensive place to throw away money, tries pretty hard to accommodate on a higher level but for the price it's a waste of money.   Although their ice tea was pretty good."}
{"text":"Being a HUGE Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef fan I had to make a trip here last time I was in Las Vegas.  BurGR is the more affordable of his three restaurants in Las Vegas but still a Gordon Ramsay experience.  When we arrived for lunch we were told there would be a 20 minute wait.  They took my cell phone number and said they would text us when our table was ready.  I thought this was great, because I hate it when restaurants give you those big vibrating devices for you to carry around looking like an idiot.  That way you don't have to hold something that a million other people have had their filthy hands on.  We ended up playing slot machines in the casino until our table was ready.  We received prompt service and all the staff we dealt with were very friendly.  We ordered the Farm Burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger and split an order of the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Both were cooked exactly the way we ordered them.  Both burgers were amazing.   At first we thought they might be a little on the small side but ended up being very filling.  One order of the Truffle Parmesan Fries is enough for two people to share.  These were some of the best french fries I've ever had.  For dessert, we tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops. One order comes with two, so it's perfect to share with someone.  They were a bit gimmicky but fun at the same time.  We enjoyed our little frozen treats, but probably will not order them again in the future.  We really enjoyed our overall experience here and guarantee we will be back to explore more of the menu.  It baffles me to read the bad reviews on BurGR, unless we just happened to come on a good day.  People complaining about paying $12 to $15 dollars for a burger need to remember you are eating at a restaurant located in a large hotel/casino on the strip in Las Vegas with the name of one of the most well known chefs in the world right now.  If you're concerned about saving a little money then join the Total Rewards program and it will get you $1 off each item you order on the menu.  I recommend you try it at least once and see for yourself and if you don't like it then in the words of Gordon Ramsay, \"Pi$$ Off!!\" Just kidding."}
{"text":"Good food. The truffle fries were good but they were under the warming lamp for too long. Service was really good.  Go for the name and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and have been waiting to try this place out. We finally got around to it and I was a bit disappointed.  It was hard to choose whether to give this place 4 stars or 3. I went with 3 for a few reasons.  When we were finally towards the front of the line, a couple in front of us returned to the front.  They told us that they were going to be seated next to the fire and it was way too hot. So the hostess said \"next 2!\" (which was us) and ran off.  When we didn't follow her, she turned around and gave us the rudest glare.  If she didn't run off she would have heard us try to tell her that we would rather not sit next to a fire.  Vegas already feels like fire 24/7, who wants to be even hotter?  Her attitude was such a turn off and put me in a bad mood.  We proceeded to get sat a few minutes later. After almost 10 minutes of sitting there without being greeted, I started to look around.  We weren't the only ones who were clearly ready to order and didn't even have drinks.  Maybe they should put more people on the floor??  We ordered the jalapeno poppers $12.  They were good.  I really liked the cheddar ranch dipping sauce.  I ordered the Farm burger $15 (duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, fried egg).  It was delicious although a tad overcooked.  I also ordered the truffle parmesan fries. Sooo good!! BUT they were undercooked.  I thought they would be hot and crisp, instead they were soggy.  What a disappointment for $11.  There's plenty of places that sell truffle parmesan fries for $4... Although the flavor of these were by far my favorite.  I loved the truffle aioli that came with it.  My mouth is watering just thinking about the fries (especially how good they would be if they were cooked right).  My bf ordered the hell's kitchen burger $14, which he liked.  But he said he should have added a fried egg and bacon on it.  For drinks we got a blue moon $7 and a cocktail $11.  I can't remember what the cocktail was called.  Although it was tasty, it was literally a mike's hard with a shot of whiskey.   Service was okay. It's a \"take your order and drop the check\" kind of restaurant...   Would I return? Not sure. If I did I would skip the drinks and the appetizer. For an appetizer, two burgers, a fry, and two drinks our bill was $80.  Very pricey for an okay experience.    Oh! Also, we were told it would be a 45 min wait, it only took 20 min to get seated. Maybe the 45 min included the time it took our server to greet us and have someone bring drinks. Also, we were not offered the \"we will text you when your table is ready\" option."}
{"text":"The Hell's Kitchen burger was yummy and kind of spicy. The onion rings are so good, so far the best onion rings I ever had. The just fries are like whatever, it's ok. I had a great time and I definitely recommend it to any one to try. The service was quick and hardly any waiting. I went on a Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"Burgers were well seasoned and tasty.  The home made ketchup was just awful (really bad).  Fries were unappealing ( plain potato taste).  Onion rings were really god but for 9.00 dollars.  Overall, 70.00 with tip for two people.   I'm sorry, but burgers are not worth that much.  The service was excellent but the burgers took 38 minutes to arrive."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, amazing atmosphere! Make sure you have the sweet potato fries with powdered sugar!"}
{"text":"My family and I are HUGE fans of Gordon Ramsey. We went to Vegas last month and decided we had to try Burgr. When we got there there was a 1 1/2 hr wait. However, they took our cell phone # and said they would text us when it was time. PERFECT! We didn't have to wait around. We walked over to the Bellagio and then did some shopping near Planet Hollywood. Soon enough our text came in and we went back to Burgr. This was hands down the BEST burger I've ever had. I've been on a quest for a great burger and I was not disappointed. We got fries and onion rings to split and the onion rings were really good. However, the burger is so filling that we could have skipped that. I got a burger with foggy onion jam and my husband and oldest daughter got duck breast bacon on their burgers. My youngest daughter likes a very plain burger but with ketchup. She said she didn't even need ketchup because her burger was so good. They were all just so delicious! The only thing that would have made this place better were if Chef Ramsey were there!"}
{"text":"The Hells Kitchen burger rocked. The chicken Udon salad was not up to par. Glad to see mgt strep up and make it right."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Loved the burger and loved the fries.  It was very cool to see the drink & dessert menu on an iPad.  We were in line for about 5 minutes and there was a hostess walking by to put names on the list.  We told her were in a party of 12.  She took down our cell phone number on the ipad and told us the wait was about 1 hour long.  She said we no longer had to wait in line, but she would text us when the table was ready.   That was cool!  We all hung out at the bar next door until we got a text.  We also had a child with us; he couldn't hang out with us at the bar but he went back to the Planet Hollywood room to watch tv and came down when we texted him.  That was convenient!"}
{"text":"This was AMAZING. Earth burger (no meat) was the best veggie burger I've ever put in my mouth. Score Gordon, score."}
{"text":"Best Burger I have ever eaten hands down! The combination of chuck, short rib and brisket makes for burger perfection. If you like a burger, and you don't come to visit BurGR in Vegas...then you're probably a Closet Vegan and should go somewhere for a salad or something....just saying.   To go with your BurGR...Parmesan Truffle Fries are a MUST!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay is my culinary hero and part time motivation coach via his TV programs. I love his exacting standards, his personality, his need to listen to negatives rather than positives.  I was so excited to try this place.  Nevermind that a burger and fries at a minimum is $22 and it only goes up from there.  The farm burger was great and the fries were pretty decent, the curry and chipotle ketchups I found interesting and unique. On the farm burger the duck breast bacon made things more enjoyable as did the ole standby fried egg.  Service started very well after a 20 minute wait to sit. It ended pretty poorly as I waited absolutely forever as the staff basically forgot I was there as they were way too interested in watching the Golden State Warriors score a lot of points. Anyway, a $40 bill for a burger, fries, beer, tax & tip is outrageous but hey welcome to Vegas."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had!!  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was AMAZING!!!  The onion rings are awesome and definitely enough to share.  The chipotle and curry ketchups are the best!  I also suggest the Toffee Pudding Push-up Pops.  Even if you don't think you have enough room, get one of these awesome desserts!  We didn't have much of a wait.  It's cool that they text you when your table is ready, so you can walk around the casino, gamble or shop while you wait.  I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Over-hyped is what I'd describe this restaurant.   First off, we walk up to the host stand as no one else was around waiting for a table and they say rudely \"You have to wait in line\". There was no line. But we comply and get in line only for her to seat us 30 seconds later. Annoyed.   We get seated and our super friendly server comes around immediately asking for our drinks and if we have any questions. He was very personable throughtout our meal and really was probably the best part of our experience. Made me forget about the rude hosts up front.   Food-  Jalapeno poppers app: 6 pieces that come out in their own shot glass of ranch. The server had explained one was a surprise, still had seeds in it and would be spicy. We like spicy and it kinda made it fun (like russian roulette).  American burger: This was kind of a miss for me. When I order an All American burger I imagine a juicy burger with all the fixings, mayo, ketchup, mustard etc. First off there were no condiments in the burger. It was completely dry. The beef patty was a little on the dry side as well. I would have liked it a little more pink but it wasn't an option for me to tell them how I wanted it cooked. Disappointing.   Bf got the Fish & Crisp: Came out looking like a hotdog almost. The fish was battered nicely and was topped with fried chip shavings. There wasn't much tartar sauce on the actual sandwich so we asked for more on the side. Flavor was very one dimensional and we were bored with it after the first couple bites. Not that exciting.   Truffle Parm Fries: Thick steak cut fries topped with lots of flavorful goodness. Came with an aioli and ketchup that tasted like a bloody mary. I would have liked regular ketchup better.   Overall, food was just ok. But for the price you pay I don't think it's worth it. Server was great but hosts could use some help and not be so snotty."}
{"text":"Excellent Burger, great fries, good atmosphere!  Of most 5 star gourmet burger joints, this place does not disappoint. Burger cooked to perfection, chargrilled and juicy. I choose the Hells Kitchen Burger with mild asadero cheese melting into roasted jalapeños and oven-roasted tomatoes with cool avocado balancing out the bunch. Price was right at $15 dollars a person. Stop, drop and indulge!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there in August '13 and it was a great experience. The food was really good and the service was even better. After aproximately 30 minutes in the line (they don't take reservations) we were seated at a table close to the kitchen. At the table you get an interactive drink menu with info on all the cocktails, beers and wine. My GFs cocktail (slow screw) was good, but a bit too sweet for her taste (she didn't know what kind of drink it was beforehand). As a starter we shared the fury chicken wings. They were heavenly! The meat fell off the bone as soon as you cut into them. As for flavours - the mild ones were absolutely delicious. The spicy ones had blue cheese on them and I am not a big fan of blue cheese because I think its destinctive flavour overthrows all the others. But in combination with the spices it really worked out well.  My GF then had the Earth Burger and from what I tasted it was really good. The goat cheese really made it into something out of the ordinary. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was absolutely mouthwatering. The meat was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the whole palette of flavours was great. As a side I had the Beer Battered Maoi Onion Rings which were delicious as well. The house made Ketchup and Ranchsauce really stood out. My GFs Sweet Potatoe Fries were good, but we both didn't care for the sugar on top of them! Sadly we were both too full to order some Shakes because they looked awesome...  The service was perfect! We had the cutest waitress (can't remember her name though). She was quick, attentive and friendly. Just what we expected."}
{"text":"Meh. I was under-whelmed. PH itself is very cramped and makes me feel claustrophobic. When we got in line, which we fully expected to do for a Saturday night, the line ran along the front restaurant window, which has open flames going behind it. On an already warm night, I don't really want to be forced to stand next to a heated window for 20 minutes. (I noticed there is a table on the other side of this window. Do not sit here! The women on the other side sitting next to the flames were roasting, fanning themselves with the menus and perspiring.)    When we got to the front of the line, the hostess never even acknowledged us. No eye contact or smile, let alone a greeting. Eventually one of them said \"follow me please\" and my husband and I stepped forward. The hostess rolled her eyes and said \"not you\" and motioned to one of the large parties that had been waiting. It was not the friendliest vibe.  When we were seated, it was at one of many two-tops, all crammed together down the center of the restaurant. Our table was basically right next to the couple next to us, which gave the feel that we were eating with strangers. It was also so loud, between people talking and blaring music, my husband and I couldn't hear each other without constantly leaning over our table and yelling to repeat ourselves. (And we're in our early 30s. Our hearing is fine and I'm not one to complain about restaurant noise)  As for the food, everything is a la carte. You get a burger on a plate. You want fries or onion rings, that's another $10+. Fine, whatever, it's the strip. It was also inconvenient that you don't get a drink menu when seated. You have to wait for the waitress to bring you the iPad with the drink menu on it. So we ended up sitting there for more than 20 minutes before we actually got to order drinks. Also, once you order the drink, the iPad is whisked away so if you want to choose a second drink, you have to ask for it back. It's all a bit inconvenient.   I'm sad to say that the burgers themselves were nothing out of the ordinary. I wasn't crazy about the selections to begin with. None of the burgers offered really had what I was looking for. I ended up getting the Farm Burger and it was.... fine. No complexity of flavor. Nothing special at all. The burgers at Shake Shack, or heck even Habit Grill are better in my opinion. I was really expecting to be blown away since all they do here is burgers. And for that price, they should be amazing. The Onion rings were also bland. Hubby got an Earth Burger. I have made better portabella burgers at home. It was a lame effort for the only vegetarian sandwich on the menu. I got some really good beer that I enjoyed (at $14 a glass, yikes!) and hubs got 2 different cocktails. The cocktails were about $10-$12 each, reasonable for the strip, but without much complexity or flavor. They went along with the meal. Pretty dull.  With our 2 burgers, 1 order of onion rings and 2 drinks each, our bill was over $100. This did not strike me as $100 meal.  Hubby and I both agree that we enjoyed each others company and we are glad to finally have tried Burger, as it has been on our list for a while. Well, it's been checked off the list and we will not be returning. I will say that despite the hostess being pretty rude and unfriendly, quite the opposite was true for our servers and bussers. They were all very fast, helpful and friendly. They get 5 stars for sure.   Gordon Ramsay shouldn't make himself the king of criticism if he can't get his own restaurants right. From the set up and decor to the menu and food quality itself, the whole thing smacks of \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Burger was very good. Thick and juicy.   Fries were average and definitely not worth the price.  Milkshake was the best I ever had!   Ambience is very good. Not formal, but has an upscale feel, thanks in part to an awesome fire display."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a strong 4 stars for their food, but we waited for nearly an hour for our order so my final rating is a weak 3 stars.  Three adjacent tables that were seated 15-20 minutes after us were served their food, paid, and left before we got our food.  Although the server was somewhat apologetic and the manager ended up comping our fries and drinks, I don't think that I would ever go back."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Magical cows.  Yes, magical cows grazing on magical grass. On a magical farm.  Cows who willingly provide magical milk for the shakes and give their lives to create the greatest hamburgers ever made.  It's the only explanation I can come up with.  I'm not a big fan of the Gordon Ramsay 'Hell's Kitchen' show like many who frequent BurGR are.  I've seen maybe two episodes at best.  So when people started pointing at the executive chef, I had to Google her from the name embroidered on her chef's uniform.  Turns out she won Season Ten.  I didn't care, but that's kind of interesting.  But not as interesting as my meal.  I normally wouldn't wait in line 30 minutes for a meal at a burger joint, but I was dining alone and there was a very short wait to eat at the counter. I'd heard good things so it seemed an ideal opportunity to try it out.  Next time I'm in town, I'll happily wait 30 minutes, an hour or however long it takes because it's well worth the wait.   The menu includes some selection of appetizers (onion rings looked amazing) and a selection of about ten burgers.  They had salads and some other stuff, but really why bother?  There is a fancy hot dog that seemed popular, but I was focused on getting one of these famous burgers I have heard about.  Burgers ranged from the good old American Burger (my choice, a plain cheeseburger the way those magical cows probably intended) to other interesting combinations. One of the specialty burgers involved duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  It's that kind of place.  My burger and the bun were terrific.  It's not cheap ($13 for burger alone) but worth it.  Burgers are  cooked over an apple wood fire or something, which I guess actually makes a difference?  Or it's just the magical cows again.   Fries include sweet potato, truffle parmesan, and 'just fries' - had the regular fries and the chipotle and curry ketchups were available as well.  Amazing.  Add $9.  Finally, the milkshakes - ranging from creme brulee (my runner up - next time) to coconut to caramel pudding and more.  I chose 'Shake #3' which included a banana milkshake covered in butterscotch pudding and topped with a snickerdoodle cookie.  It was SOOOOOO good it has at the very least tied the Twinkie shake at BLT Burger for best shake ever.  I may need to conduct a side-by-side taste test next time I'm in town.  Add another $9.  Yes, $9 for a shake.  Worth every penny.  The ambiance is great and, if you are into the whole 'celebrity chef' thing, you'll love it even more.  Service was prompt and super-friendly, and the food, as I said, is wonderful.  It's the magical cows.    The whole meal, just a burger, fries and milkshake, came to about $40 with tip.  Yes, $40 for a basic burger and fries.  Again repeat after me. . . . worth. every. penny.  Kudos, Gordon Ramsay.  I didn't think I'd every pay that kind of money for a burger.  But I did, and I will again.  When you visit your magical farm please tell the cows I thank them for their service!"}
{"text":"Such a pleasure to finally be able to eat at one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants, as my husband and I are big fans of his TV personality. Our meal was delicious and reasonably priced. The front staff (hostesses) seemed very disinterested in providing a welcoming face to the restaurant, but our waiter/servers were eager to please and friendly. I ordered the chicken burger: marvelous! Wasn't dry, great flavor, light and rather healthy. My husband ordered some beef burger (not sure which one), he thoroughly enjoyed his burger as well."}
{"text":"Finished running the Vegas RnR and needed some solid grub to replenish what I used up in that cold, windy race. I caught sight of this place in PH and decided to give it a go. Best meal decision I have made in Vegas for a very long time. Waitress Kelsey was warm, affable and was not afraid to offer real recommendations, not recommendations that are part of the evening push. Kelsey and the support staff worked exceptionally well together and she appeared to have a solid choreography in place to ensure that I was taken care of properly. Dustin Mohawk was friendly and did a great job of enhancing my impression of the wait staff. The food was excellent. I went for the Britannia burger and it was superb. Leading up to the burger were the Maui Onion Rings which should be illegal they are so tasty! The Truffle Fries were excellent and I chased everything with multiple glasses of root beer and water. I will return!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service.  It took 10 minutes for a server to greet us....\"drink order? ... what do you want to eat?\"  Took my wife 15 minutes for her wine to arrive...the waitress was more interested in flirting with her co-workers....too many good restaurants in Vegas for poor service like this.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"What can I say....this place ROCKS.  Great service and amazing food.  The parm/garlic fries are so amazingly good!!  I had the Farm burger again and it was perfectly cooked medium.  I LOVE LOVED IT !!  My husband has a protein burger and loved his as well.  We sat at the bar, watched the UFC fights and had a few cocktails.  The drinks were wonderful."}
{"text":"Still pretty awesome.  We started with the pork buns.  The pork was delicious and had a very good mouth feel.  The chicken sliders were tasty (but Chick-fil-A is better).  I've tried the Euro Burger, the Chanterelle Burger, The Hog (pork) Burger, and also the Fish Sandwich.  ALL were very tasty.  You have to get the Truffle Fries.  Yum.  But you can skip the Sweet Potato fries.  They put powdered sugar on the fries which make them taste weird.  I also got the #1 shake which has the caramel pudding on top.  OMG, it was so good!  It sufficed for dessert.  The little cookie garnish was delicious!"}
{"text":"The burger was very well put together and had an amazing taste! Loved there selection of beers! Wait was not to bad considering it was a Sunday night with Sunday night football playing on all 5000 of there TVs. Only small issue I noticed was the host staff didn't seem to like there jobs very much and looked very annoyed and concerned of how they looked instead of trying to accommodate the crowd. Overall the service was great, the food came out pretty fast and the prices are not bad considering the type of restaurant and location it's at."}
{"text":"The best burger and shake that I've ever had. They are known for there milkshakes but these aren't your average shakes. A light milk shake (all though very filling) ice cold, with a rich, creamy pudding, then a scoop of whip cream then topped with a cookie. Warning the milkshakes are huge but they're so good you won't want to share.      The burgers are your basic burgers but with a twist but they are amazing. Every time I'm in Las Vegas this is where I want to eat.      The ambiance of the restaurant is great it's very trendy and modern but yet it kind of feels like a sports bar but it's great."}
{"text":"I arrived 15-20 minutes before opening and there was already a line. Once open my partner and I were seated promptly. We ordered the the Truffle Parmesan Fries, Farm Burger and the Hell's Kitchen Burger.   My mouth exploded with flavors after the first bite of truffle parmesan fries. It was just that good! I've never in my life had fries that good. Bite after bite I couldn't stop myself. Even after eating my burger and I was stuffed I still kept eating. Fries weren't overly greasy, the potato had a nice velvety texture, and the parmesan added an extra touch of indulgence. My favorite sauce was the truffle mayo. It was more than enough for two people.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger because of it's name. My reasoning was simple, I've seen the show before so why not try the burger. The waiter did warn me that it was spicy and asked if I liked spicy food... I do. However, the jalepeno was very spicy in my opinion and I was gulping down water. The beef pattie was good and the bun toasty but not too toasted. My only criticism was that there's not enough advocado. I had one thin slice of advocado that only covered a third of the burger. That was a big let down. I would have enjoyed the burger so much more with the cooling effect of the advocado. One star knocked off for this.   The Farm burger was delightful. Everthing was cooked well and the egg ozzing out was perfection.   I would definitely recommend this place. I don't think the price is high considering it's right on the strip in Planet Hollywood and it belongs to a world famous chef. Service was great. Our waiter was VERY friendly and attentive. He took the time to talk to us, even though the restaurant was filling up. I really appreaciated this, especially in Vegas.   Thanks for the yummy food!"}
{"text":"Hog burger and the chicken sliders yum!!! American for the kids, I didn't try it but kids loved it. Fries were ok. Would come back and bring friends. :)"}
{"text":"Being a Gordon Ramsay fangirl, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try one of his restaurants while in Vegas. And the boyfriend, being a burger fanatic, couldn't pass up the opportunity to try another burger joint. It was the perfect match (and perfect excuse) to line ourselves up for 40 minutes to get one of those coveted tables.  All of the servers are extremely kind, helpful, and knowledgeable about the burgers. Each one comes out in a perfect sphere of deliciousness, and it is quite a bit embarrassing to try to stuff it in your mouth to take a bite, so this may not be the place to take a first date. I ordered the Farm Burger, and everything was absolutely scrumptious. I savored every single bite and felt perfectly full afterwards. The truffle fries were equally as yummy and are definitely a must-try.  The cherry on top that made this meal even better was the dessert shake. I ordered the coffee with chocolate hazelnut pudding (doesn't that just sound amazing?), and I was in heaven. If there's one thing that I would want to eat when I'm having a bad day, it's that. I'm craving it right now as I'm being reminded of its creamy and chocolatey taste. Mmmmmm....  Just as expected, this Gordon Ramsay restaurant delivered absolute perfection, and the price isn't too bad considering the other non-buffet options that are available on the Strip."}
{"text":"So I've been on a Gordon Ramsay thing lately because I've been watching kitchen nightmares and MasterChef. Not going to lie, I was really excited when I saw his restaurant burgr and was like, ohhhsnaps, it's Gordon Ramsey's face on the posters. I went with a couple of friends, about 6, and the wait was about two hours long. I should have went earlier and grabbed seats. When the time came to order, I focused my attention towards the customer service and the scenery around me because Gordon Ramsay sure makes a hell of a big deal out of it on kitchen nightmare. Needless to say, the service was great and the waitresses wore body-hugging clothing, perfect. Prices are a bit up there though for some burger and fries. Burgers were about an average of $15, $8 for fries, $7 I think for the milkshakes. I expected a more gratifying taste from my first bite of the euro burger, it was still good but not worth getting yelled at by chef Ramsay for. Fries are a must get. They were thick, big, and delicious, literally. The shakes were interesting. It has some bean texture pudding thing on top and shake on the bottom. It seemed a bit overpowering towards the end, but I love sweets so I guess it does not phase me. Ultimately, not worth the two hour wait      . My next stop in the future will be tasting the infamous beef Wellington in Gordon Ramsey's steak."}
{"text":"Just finished.  Burger was ok. Not worth the money. Fries came after I was done with burger. Service is bad. Waited and hour and half for and average burger. Spend a few extra bucks and go somewhere nice."}
{"text":"Great food, beer, Cocktail menu. Service was great. I had the Backyard Burger and my son had the Hells Kitchen Burger and we had the Mushroom Poutine for appetizer. Amazing!! A little slow on food delivery but not a big deal. I would come back again. Get here early before 12 because the hungry crowds line up!"}
{"text":"Most overrated restaurant in las vegas next to all the bobby flay bs. Hired model wannabe staff who are rude and stuck up. Service sucked but what would you expect from entitled wannabes. The food is a joke of different food channel concoctions and is at best a burger joint staffed with hotties.  Only foodie wannabes and has beens rate this high.  Most people say its great because of all the hype, the tv exposure, and to make themselves feel good about the dragged out long waits they had to endure for mediocrity and the painfully outrageous prices. In reality, they know it sucked and their wallets got sucked dry even worse for it.  We all know gordan ramsay is a complete jerk and a hole to people on tv. This place will close down in less than three years. There are WAY better out there at normal prices.  For people to say this is the best burger they had in their life is a laugh as they will later realize in life they got suckered into all this gordan ramsay hype."}
{"text":"The Uber Burger is the best burger by far on this menu. I have never enjoyed the flavor of a hamburger like I did this burger. It is the best that I have ever had. I shared bites with my friends & they too agree that Zi had the best burger in the table. His buns are also out of this world!  If you visit this restaurant @ Planet Hollywood in Vegas I highly recommend The Uber burger.  The service of staff was outstanding too!  My friends even had to buy his cool t-shirts to remember our great experience. His sweet potato fries come with a delicious dipping sauce too. I will always go back when I'm Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had. Pretty noisy environment, but the food, shakes, and appetizers were amazing."}
{"text":"The best thing we ordered was the hummus appetizer.  For a burger place, that says a lot. We were two vegetarians and two meat eaters eating at Burgr. The place was recommended by a Vegan friend so we thought - hey should make everyone happy!  The hummus was great, though came with some weird veggies to dip with such as green onions? Flat bread was good too though they only gave us 4 little triangles. We had to order more as had so much hummus left over and were charged $4 extra which was a bit steep for more bread. Most restaurants will just bring you more.   The veggie burgers were very very average. Just a Portabello mushroom cap. I've had better elsewhere. We also ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was recommended by the waitress as one of their most popular and the Chicken Burger. No rave reviews here. The Hell's Kitchen Burger arrived stone cold and underdone (my friend had specified she preferred hers medium-well). We sent it back and the burger was still underdone but we had given up by that point.   Expect to wait up to an hour or more for you table. Luckily, the hostess will take down your cell number and text you when your table is ready so you can go to the mall or have a drink somewhere.   Overall: Go eat elsewhere. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"I may be biased because I'm obsessed with Gordon. I have loved all of his Vegas restaurants!"}
{"text":"Really delicious everything!!! Waited in the line for a whole though. The waiters seem to be pretty busy so expect some delay. The food is totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"GORDON RAMSAY BURGR Gordon Ramsay!!! I love this place! One of the best burgers in town! So many styles to choose from and all made from the freshest ingredients! Don't forget to order one of their special milk shakes as well! Creme Brule Oreo milk shake! Seriously, one of the most guilty pleasures in the world for those with a sweet tooth! You can't miss this one! So devilishly refreshing! In addition, their fries are amazing. Get the regular and sweet potato fries combo, where the fries are topped with powdered sugar and comes with a sweet honey dip. As for the burgers, the Hell's Kitchen, Hog, and American are delicious!"}
{"text":"I not your average burger lover , actually I'm not big on burgers but Ramsey burger is an institution for amazing burgers and food.  This simple but we'll crafted menu has something for all.  I'm not eating beef right now but the ahi sliders as well as the lobster and shrimp burgers are great fill ins for cravings"}
{"text":"One of the best burger I have had in a long time. Had the Euro burger, yummy. Sat at the bar Teresa gave us great service"}
{"text":"Amazing burger!  I loved the Euro burger and shake #4 which was an oreo shake with creme brulee.  I went during lunch time so there was no line and the wait for our food was shorter than I had expected.  This place is worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Truffle Aioli, Truffle Fries and The Farm Burger (Wood Fired Patty, Brioche Bun, Duck Breast Bacon, English Sharp Cheddar and a fried Egg w/runny Yolk) is all you need for an epic meal. All other burgers sampled here did not live up to the hype of the Farm Burger mentioned above. Super juicy well seasoned patty was cooked perfectly medium rare. If you like your burgers cooked more than medium as I'm seeing in negative reviews for undercooked meat you're just plain ol crazy in my book. If you enjoy gnawing on dense cardboard then do your thang boo thang, but you're not included in my inner circle of trust. Seating around 11pm was quick, about a 15 minute wait. Service was efficient. The boys seemed to enjoy the interactive iPad Beer Menu a tad bit much lol... Everyone in our party of 6 were fully satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere, and excellent service.  Thank you Ms. Christina Wilson for taking time for some photos with our daughter Katie, making her your favorite shake, and personally delivering it to her!  What a fun experience. We will for sure be back upon our next visit to Vegas and highly recommend this place if you want a really yummy burger, appetizers, fries, and much more."}
{"text":"OMG!! my favorite place to come. Farm burger is off the hook however you can still order any burger and get the fried egg on it. and they do an awesome job. wish they would go back to the skinny fires though. truffle fries where my wife's favorite but they went to a fat fry and it wasn't quite the same. The Onion Rings are the best I have had. Booze and beer selection is pretty good. I think the service was great. yes sometimes there can be a long wait so expect to gamble a bit or get a drink at another bar so it does not seem so long. I will keep coming back as long as they keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely underwhelming experience.  The only stars is for our waiter.  5/5 for customer service. He was so nice and attentive. We had an issue with our appetizer which I will explain below but he was so apologetic, and quick to resolve the problem.   1/5 for food. Honestly it seems just like a big hype. We have been talking about coming here during every Vegas trip for a little over a year. The lines have always been crazy long and our schedules did not allow us to wait that long. This time they did and we were so so excited to eat here. We waited about 30 mins in line. We ordered the Jalapeño poppers, onion rings and 2 Hells Kitchen Burgers.  Our waiter told us burgers took about 25 mins... Yikes  0/5 Jalapeño Poppers: You get 6. They come in individual shot glasses filled half way with ranch. So if you don't like ranch make sure to ask for it on the side? My husband and I both reached for a bite and at the same time looked at each other and put the rest right back.... Ice cold. Warm on the outside and cold on the inside. Not just room temp but they were in the freezer and they didn't cook long enough. Like I said our waiter was so nice and even said \"im so sorry how embarrassing \" Yeah.. What would Gordon say?! Lol  1/5 Burgers In my humble opinion this was greatly disappointing. So so basic. Not a $18 burger. Nothing different, nothing worth the almost hour wait. The bun was too thick. Just ended taking it off and eating it without it. It was also not hot, more warm. Kind of makes you wonder why wait 25 mins for a luke warm burger.  0/5 onion rings Super bready and salty. Also not hot at all.  Overall super bummed we spent 2 hrs here for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Ok, I am big fan of Gordon Ramsay and I will try to keep this review unbiased.   The Bad:   - There is a line always. But, it moves pretty fast. So, factor in the waiting time if you plan to go there.   - Time to get food served is about 30 mins. So, if you are really really hungry and can't wait for 30 mins for a premium burger, skip this place.   The Good:  -  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was the best burger I had.  - Honey-Pig Bao Buns from snacks are awesome!  What else can I say? If you are on the strip on Vegas and looking for a good burger, this is the place to visit. Surprisingly, it has been priced very reasonably. $14 for a burger, you can't ask for any better.   - Cocktails were pretty good. Ordered the jalapeno rita. Has a nice kick to it.  - Great Ambience."}
{"text":"I was by myself on the Strip looking for a place to eat.  I came in here and the friendly staff suggested that I eat at the bar (full menu) rather than waiting 45 minutes for a table.  I got fantastic service at the bar, and the food was fabulous!  I highly recommend this place not only for the food, but for the welcoming atmosphere and great customer service."}
{"text":"My SO & I had the tuna poke sliders, truffle Parmesan fries, the farm burger, & the hock burger. We were so excited to finally try one of GR's restaurants because we're big fans of him. We weren't disappointed! We went there for dinner & I'm still full to this morning. My one tip is that if you order the fries the order is large enough for up to 3 ppl to enjoy."}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Gordon Ramsay,  First and foremost, I wanted to congratulate you for the success of BurGR. You definitely have raised the bar for gourmet burgers.  My friend and I came to dine at your restaurant for the first time this past weekend. You really found yourself the prime location, right in the middle of Sin City at Planet Hollywood Casino and right next to The Miracle Mile Shops. Even walking torwards BurGR we were already impressed with the live flames and your fiery decor. You really know how to make a statement.  We waited only about ten minutes and than seated right away. The hostess was sweet and server was very attentative to our needs. He gave us great suggestions on what to order. By the way, I really  enjoyed being able to order off the Ipad menu. Unique and good way to keep up with technology.  We started off with the parmasean truffle fries, he ordered the farm burger and for myself the Hells Kitchen Burger ( I loved your show Hells Kitchen & Kitchen Nightmares ) The parmasean truffles slightly overcooked but we still devoured every piece. I tried his farm burger which included duck breast bacon, an oozing fried egg topped with cheddar cheese and it was so wonderfully good!  However, this stood no chance to my Hells Kitchen Burger which included asadero cheese, avocado, roasted jalapeno and oven roasted tomatoe. My burger was cooked to perfection and with the combination of all the ingredients, it was just so amazingly deliciousness! Needless to say, it blew my mind.   For being a renownly famous chef, the prices were very affordable, especially for the quality of food. We had such a superb dining experience at BurGR and can't wait to come back again to try other items on your menu. Your place exceeded all my expectations.  Sincerely, Your no.1 fan"}
{"text":"Terrific! Get the American burger done medium. Delicious. I'd would have liked dill pickles rather than sweet."}
{"text":"One word... AMAZING. A bit late on the review, but here it is.  Decided to come here before our flight and have early breakfast/lunch. We were there as soon as the restaurant opened, so we were seated immediately. Our waitress was very attentive and was always stopping by to make sure we were alright. We decided we were going to splurge and try a bunch of things!   We ordered the mini pigs in a blanket and fury chicken wings as our appetizer! Then we each got a main dish. Some of the favorites were the fresh roasted chili dog, the farm burger, and euro burger. Lastly we had shake #5 with hazelnut pudding and the sticky toffee pudding push up pops! Such deliciousness! Yum yum yum!!"}
{"text":"Had a farmers burger, cooked medium with an egg and slices of duck bacon on top. Onion rings and fries with parmesan truffles went well with this fancy burger. A bit spendy for burgers and fries ($14 burger $10 fries), but what can you expect, it's Vegas babymamahunnies."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good the food was fresh but I would have given it 5 stars but is wish the staff was a bit more professional"}
{"text":"This is a rather late review on my end. Went to Vegas with a groups of friends two weeks ago and we decided to try this place out. At first when I heard about it, I was worried about how my wallet would end up, considering that it's a five star restaurant and known for its burgers because of Gordon Ramsay. Surprisingly the bill wasn't too harsh, my burger, Hell's Kitchen, was only $14! However, we had to wait one hour to get a table and another 20 minutes to get our food. We were starving by the time out food arrived. We ate at night so I understand why it would be so crowded, but the wait was a bit of a downer on my parade. But the food was delicious! My burger, Hell's Kitchen, had roasted jalapeños, oven roasted tomatoes, asadero cheese, and the beef was cooked medium rare, just the way I like it. There were supposed to be sliced avocados, but I hate avocados so that was excluded from the burger. The wait for the burgers was longer than the time eating them. They are decently portioned, although I wouldn't mind them being a bit bigger. Some of my friends claimed to still be hungry after the meal, but I felt full. Appetizers like their Maui onion rings and truffle fries weren't bad either, love the chipotle ketchup! Only con of the dinner was the wait."}
{"text":"Best place I've eaten in Las Vegas so far.  The line took about 45 min., but well worth the wait.  I had the Hell's Kitchen burger that was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  The truffle fries were excellent.  Great service and very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Best burger and fries I've ever had. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Parmesan Truffle Fries.  Both were absolutely delicious. You should expect a wait to get a table here. The nice thing is they will send you a text when your table is ready."}
{"text":"They replaced the iPhone that was ruined when the waitress spilled my drink all over the table / iPhone - thank you for doing what is right! Kudos, for AMAZING customer service."}
{"text":"5 stars.   The burgers are outstanding, and you can get them made any way you like. Add an egg. Add more cheese. No bun. Whatever!  The jalapeño poppers come in a ranch dip that is addicting as any I've ever had.   The truffle fries are a la carte' and come out hot and fresh (they also have great sweet potato fries).   Not in the mood for a burger, get the giant hot dog and wow your friends   Full bar with 25+ beers on tap...and Gordon himself stopping by makes this a must see in Vegas.   Get here early, lines are long!"}
{"text":"The onion rings and great customer service saved this experience for me. I stood in line for forever and when although I was by myself and there were openings at the bar, where I offered to sit and they said I needed to wait, which was fine until after I waited for awhile another guy just came up and asked to sit there and they let him right in. Ugh. Not impressed with how they handle a crowd and their reservation system. I ordered just a regular American burger and was hoping it would be the BEST I ever tasted. It was OK. Good but I would never spend $15 on it again. The onion rings and my server were amazing...I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay BurGR was the best burger, hands down I have ever had!! I would def eat there again!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Las Vegas for innovative Pub Food. Friendly and knowledgeable staff and just great fun! Great salads and even better traditional English fare."}
{"text":"Sorry to say, what a disappointment.... 2 people in our party didn't finish their plates, they were so bad.... And we bought one order of fries to split between 3 people and after one bite, it sat untouched.  What a disappointment.... Everything was less than stellar... Even the service... Once we told our waiter we did not want anything from the bar, we never saw him again...  We were planning on going to BLT Steak, but no way is that happening now!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the special, Gordan Ramsay Burger, definitely did not live up to \"Nevada's top rated burger\" as our waitress described it. The burger wasn't too special, a bit dry but everything else was fine. It was all the brand name and hype in my opinion."}
{"text":"I would have given them 5 stars after my first two times here, but I have removed a star because their service has been a little lacking. My food was served cold this last time, and the burger was not even cut like I had requested. I asked them to cut my burger and it took the waitress another 10 minutes to get it back. My family had to wait for me while their food got colder, so I wouldn't have to be burgerless..  My favorite items are the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg. Their fries are very tasty and I love the curry ketchup. I have also had the onion rings, which are also worth trying. The Honey-Pig Bao Buns were just okay. I would recommend you try this place out, but I think I have been here enough times to not want to return for a while."}
{"text":"The wait. The only thing stopping my highest recommendation was the wait. The wait was awful. There was not an empty table, the waiter was apologetic but not grovelingly so, and yet the wait was of an epic status. It was nearly an hour for burgers, fries, and the very misnamed \"pigs in a blanket\" (this is not a kids' item. In fact this is not a kids' restaurant by any stretch of the word)  #TBT That burger tho.   In my life I have never once eaten a burger that could be compared to this. My wife got the Hell's Kitchen and I got the Euro. Hers was awesome too , but I feel like my burger and I had a love affair. Hours later I am still thinking about it. You know how some food stays with you for a while? Like maybe all day you're burping nachos and wondering how you let your friend talk you into going to Outback in Mission Valley? (Worst location nationwide, voted by me only) Well I keep having little reminders of this burger and it's not even slightly unpleasant. I want to go back to their kitchen and see if I can become an intern or an apprentice but my vacation is over tomorrow and my family needs me. If I live 100 years I doubt ill ever have another burger like this, and I will never visit Las Vegas again without eating at BURGR. If I ever have a chance to eat at another of chef Gordon's restaurants I will not miss it.   Seriously. Longest wait for a burger ever. Worth every minute."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Came here Saturday night approximately 7ish pm.  Waited for about 30 minutes.  First off, aren't people wow'd by all that gas wasted used for a firey window display?  Must be an expensive gas bill at the end of the day.   Loved the ambiance.  Wished I sat near the bar where we can see the chefs cook and bring the plates out for a better experience just like the show!  Food - The Jalapeño Poppers - Really good, but very spicy! Served super hot and crispy on the outside.    Parmesan Truffle Fries - Good, like the sauces that accompanied it.   Hell's Kitchen Burger - was so so.  Added portobello mushroom with it! $8.00 to add portobello mushroom. Did not know to add portobello mushrooms it would cost half the burger. lol wtf.  Creme Brulee Oreo Milkshake - Let me tell you, the milkshake is pricey.  However, the milkshake is bomb!!!! Basically half the cup was the oreo milkshake while the top half was the creme brulee.  I felt like creme brulee could have been better.  Overall the prices for the food were on point (minus the $8.00 to add portobello mushrooms) Not sure if I'd come back here again.  Tip - Make sure to sign up for a Total rewards Card - It's free and takes $1.00 off every item you order off the menu."}
{"text":"If this is what a Krabby Patty tastes like, then I have finally found it. Hands down one of the best burgers I have ever had! My boyfriend agrees as well! Although there was a wait, I was actually kind of expecting it, because well, it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant! I love the decor, there's a large fire display, and there's a nice, hip vibe to the restaurant. The greeter was very sweet and polite, and it was maybe a 30 minute wait for the two of us. Our server, I think his name was Matt (he mentioned he worked since the opening of the restaurant) was great! He was friendly, and very polite.  Although the food took a while to come out, the wait was well worth it. We ordered two burgers, sweet potato fries, and truffle fries. I would recommend the sweet potato fries over the truffle. Burgers were delicious and our experience was great! Would definitely come back when we go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Burger was wonderful.  The fries were horrible. The wait was super long and there were plenty of open tables with no one sitting at them."}
{"text":"You can do better, Gordon Ramsay ! Burgers were good but not AMAZING. Also their fries suck. They were super stale and hard. The table next to mine didn't even touch their basket of fries. Any fast food fries are better than what I had. Maybe it was a bad batch but enough for me to not come back. There are better and cheaper options in Vegas!   P.S. Their uniforms were so tacky. Fake Demin shirts that were a size too small for the male waiters haha"}
{"text":"As fans of Gordon Ramsay (despite his flawed personality), we were excited to try this place. We got in line and waited about 30-45 minutes. After being seated, I ordered a raspberry tea to try and ended up not liking it. Luckily, our server was nice enough to let me switch it out. Other than the long periods of waiting for our server to approach our table so we could get something from him, he was pretty nice and friendly and gave us input on burgers when we asked. I ordered the Farm Burger (duck bacon with cheddar and a fried egg) and the other ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger. We also got an order of truffle fries to share. I really liked my burger but he was not big on his, too heavy. The truffle fries were pretty awesome though and we devoured them.  All in all, a pretty good place to eat but beware as it's a little pricey as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! Best-friend and I came here because we had been watching a lot of Gordon Ramsay and wanted to try out his food. I ordered an American Cheeseburger since I'm pregnant and can't have most of the cheeses on the burgers and didn't want to kill the taste of the burger by asking for a different cheese. My friend ordered the farm burger. We split the parmesan truffle fries.   My burger was good! The meat alone was delicious. My friend really liked hers. The fries and the aioli sauce that comes with it were sooooo good! Prices aren't bad either. The soda is $4 which is kinda crazy. Both our burgers were $13 I think. Fries were $8 and just one order was enough for us both.   Despite it being so good, I don't feel like it was the most amazing burger ever and I can never eat a burger anywhere else ever again haha. But those fries definitely want me to come back!"}
{"text":"It was late night and my bf and I just arrived in Vegas. We haven't eaten and I'm hangry. We decided to grab a quick bite and remembered the goat cheese burger we had here last time was delicious, even though I don't like cheese.   When we arrived, I was surprised that there was a line at this hour, but we were seated within 10 mins cause we opted to be seated at the bar. We were told the burger would take 20 mins to make after we ordered. 40 mins later, we were still waiting. Our pork belly \"hot\" pocket was cold when it arrived. By now, I was about to throw a hissy fit. Right before I do, our truffle burger magically appears and perfectly cut in half to share. First bite in, my anger goes away like those hangry Snicker commercials. I apologized to my bf for every side-eye I gave him during the wait. Even without the truffle aioli and foie gras creme that makes the burger extra flavorful, the patty itself was so juicy. It's all I ever want when I crave a burger! Simple but juicy! One of the best burgers I have ever eaten!  Ramsey can make one hell of a burger!"}
{"text":"BurGR is one of the only reasons I will venture down to the strip. It's a pain to get to, but well worth it.   The farm burger is my personal favorite. Topped with english cheddar, duck bacon, and a fried egg, it's perfection on a plate. Get their fries that come with house made curry and chipotle flavored ketchup."}
{"text":"Waited anxiously for this unique gourmet burger popularized by owner and renowned chef Gordon Ramsay.  The feeling of spontaneous joy after biting into this burger was nothing short of perfection. Savory, delicious and flavorful burger, instantly one of my top burgers really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"UPDATE: There is a vegan portobello option but their buns do have egg in them. For a true vegan option choose the portobello with lettuce in place of the bun! It's super yum!      Having only one choice here we have only been here once other than one Yelp event that I attended alone.   The veggie burger is ok but we had to send them both back the first time because they had cheese on them...  We really love the sweet potato fries. (They left off the powder sugar off for us.)  I can honestly say I can't get a straight answer if this burger is vegetarian or vegan. The big question is does it really not have egg white in it? Does the bun really not have egg white in it? We both had rumbling tummies later so not sure if it was the fries because we hardly ever eat fried food or because the item(s) had egg in them.  The service is excellent and super fast and very nice. We had about five people tell us sorry about the cheese on the burgers and it almost got overkill of kindness and they offered us free dessert lol. We declined I don't think they have something we could eat anyway.   Would we visit again? Defiantly if I could get a YES THE BURGER AND BREAD ARE VEGAN. I think if we were craving fries and fruity drinks we might just sit up at the bar. Otherwise I think we shall pass."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I have ever had in my entire life. I had the farm fresh and the flavor was fantastic. They also were not afraid to cook it rare which I asked for. Also super friendly service, fast, and helpful. I went with my husband on a Monday night and we were seated right away. I would not recommend going on Saturday. We tried and were told it was about an hour and a half wait time. They also had great beer!"}
{"text":"Came in around 7pm on Saturday night and it was packed. We originally had a party of four and the hostess said it would be an hour and a half wait. She put my name on the list and the text us when the table was ready (it took 45 min).By that time we had acquired 2 more people. One of the manager guys told us to hang tight and he would accommodate the change; we were seated 10 minutes later. The service was great. All the staff was pleasant and although busy, it seemed like we were the only table our waitress had. It's reasonably priced as well. We had a Hells Kitchen Burger which was ok, nothing to back flip about. The Parmesan fries were delicious with the house ketchup; there was a truffle mayo too but I found it to be too bold for my taste buds. Sweet potato fries were good too. I can't give 5 stars b/c the burger was just ok and they don't take reservations. Everything else was on point though. We'll be back to try out some more burgers :)"}
{"text":"Wait for table was quick which was nice since there were 6 of us. Wait for food was a bit long, actually the fries came super quick which was good, but the burgers took half an hour. Waitress warned us they take about 20 mins, so 30 wasn't crazy, but next time say 30. The fries were hot and good. We got the plain ones for $8. I wanted to hate the food since I figured the whole celebrity chef thing was going to be another vegas scam (and I was impatient and hungry). No such luck, the burgers were *really* good. I got the yardbird and would get it again in a heartbeat. Would have been 5 stars if they had stepped up the timing. Still even with the slow down, it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"There are a lot of highly rated burger places in Vegas. After comparing menus, we decided to go with BurGR.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait for about 10 minutes, so not bad. We saw the line grow quite a bit while we were there. Our waiter was excellent! He was friendly, offered great suggestions, and took very good care of us, and he was REALLY cute! He recommended the Farmhouse, which has duck breast bacon and a fried egg. It was cooked to a perfect medium well. I ordered the Parmesan truffle fries, which came with a truffle aioli and a curry ketchup. They were fantastic. At the end of the meal, we ordered a shake. I absolutely recommend saving room for a shake. Ours was cookies and cream, topped with creme brûlée pudding and vanilla whipped cream. It was to die for. So good! During our meal, Gordon Ramsey himself decided to come in for a meal, which was super cool! While trying to grab a look, I bumped my table and spilled our beers everywhere. The staff was so great at cleaning it up and making sure we were ok. The waiter brought us two new beers on him, and I felt totally embarrassed! Overall, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"It was totally worth the 30 minute wait in line to get into the restaurant.  I am a huge fan of Kitchen Nightmares and this was my first visit to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.  The restaurant held true to what Gordon always tells owners on the show - a beautiful place, a simple to understand menu, and fresh ingredients prepared well.  I had the Britannia burger and it was literally the best burger I have ever eaten in my life. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Burgr is definitely worth a stop if you are on The Strip!"}
{"text":"We have read yelp reviews, and we got great recommendations,  and we decided to check this place out. We have waited 45 minutes to be seated  (3  pm on Sat ) and as a result our expectation were that the burger will be extraordinary. However, the burger was fine and the service was slow. we ordered hell Kitchen and farm burger, onion rings and fries- the burgers were cocked the same as we asked ( medium) and the buns were amazing, however the fries were dry.  I think that due to high expectations we were disappointment. One more word about the service- I believe that after 45 minutes waiting I can expect that water will keep coming to the table and that the waitress will be more alert and should ask if I want another beer. Also, I don't think it's polite to ask if she can take my plate while I am eating the fries and my wife is still eating her burger. Just a tip."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! It was a very relaxed and pleasant experience. None of the uppity feeling like from other restaurants. Food was GREAT. Onion rings and truffle fries were soooooo tasty. Burgers were great and the sticky toffee pudding pops were a great way to end the meal. We will go back any time we can."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas, this place should definitely be on your list to try! If there are any vegetarians in your group, it is also for them. They do have a vegetarian burger that I'm certain is delicious. I went on their grand opening night and was very pleased with their great service. The atmosphere is fun and the food did not disappoint. The servers are very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about everything on the menu which made it difficult to decide what to order since it all sounded so good. My recommendations, if you order the Hell's Kitchen burger, ask for Jalapeños on the side. They are VERY spicy, this way you can at least have the option of putting them in your burger. And if you still have room for dessert, definitely try the strawberry shake with coconut pudding. By far the best tasting dessert I have ever had."}
{"text":"This was a very tasty burger cooked the way I requested. We had about a twenty minute wait from the time we arrived til we were seated. It is pricey. We had two burgers and two soft drinks and our bill was close to $40."}
{"text":"Amazed I could taste my food after sitting in the stench of cigarette smoke in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We have a winner!!! (for now) after several attempts to find the best burger in Vegas, this year's stop brought us to GR's BurGR... I was a bit sceptical since I dislike chefs who are on TV longer that inside a kitchen but I had to swallow my skepticism together with the delicious burger I had. The Euro burger, with truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomatoes was out-of-this-world good; so was the Hell's Kitchen burger with asadero cheese, jalapeño and avocado; portions were perfect and prices average for Vegas Strip but low if you consider the quality of the burger (and the fact that the restaurant's has a famous chef's name in it - that's mainly what raises the prices around here) The location inside the PH casino is not really the nicest you might expect, I thought it was going to be noisy but it wasn't as noisy as I thought it would be. The furniture that resembles a cafeteria or a hotel restaurant (there were also a couple of screens showing sports) gives it a kind of relaxed atmosphere and not that of a fancy gourmet burger place. I had other great burgers in Vegas (Stripburger, I *heart* burgers, etc.) but this one had that extra something. Since I still have to try others, let's give it 5 stars and the title of \"best burger in Vegas so far\""}
{"text":"So you're in Vegas. You want to eat a decent meal but you don't have a reservation. You also want a good meal that doesn't leave you feeling ill and/or worse, feeling like you were ripped off.   BURGR for the win! We had amazing, creative and well thought out burgers. The onion rings and fries are delicious.  My friends took it to the next level and ordered the milkshake.  I had the euro burger which was fantastic, cooked perfectly and all elements perfectly placed for some seriously crave-able good eats. Did I just say that?  The onion rings and fries come with very nicely paired sauces and the milkshake...well the milkshake was a huge hit. I don't even know if \"this is the best milkshake I have ever had\" can say enough. Those girls talked about that milkshake the rest of the trip (they had the banana butterscotch one).  If we go back to Vegas we will for sure be coming back to Burgr and I am already excited about it :)."}
{"text":"Really Good ****: Hells Kitchen Burger (spicy and tasty, a little too much char for me) Good ***:  onion rings (good flavor, but greasy and expensive)"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I've ever had! The hawg was full of flavor, perfectly seasoned and grilled! After I finished I sat there in the afterglow of my amazing experience! A big thank you to Gordon Ramsay, his cooks and  our server Brandon for giving us this experience!"}
{"text":"This review is based off of  Dessert only.   Came here at about a hour before closing for dessert. I wanted to try the sticky toffee pudding sooo bad. But wait its not a pudding at all! Its a sticky toffee pudding push up pop. So I still decided to get it along with the creme brulee milk shake. So the frozen push pop came and it has absolutely no sticky toffee caramel pudding, it was peanut butter ice cream with a dry hard cholocate toffee cake and another layer of peanut butter ice cream and hard stale cake. No sticky toffee anywhere. Ramsey, your people missed the mark here and I am not too happy about the false advertisement.   The milk shake initially was great but when you get to the creme brulee it unfortunately wasn't a brulee. The milkshake was also very heavy and had us looking for the nearest restroom :( sad but I have faith that some changes will be made one day."}
{"text":"I was contemplating just getting a slider appetizer, but ended up getting a full berger and split hers and mine.  The burgers are great and the food is tasty.  Make sure you get there early because there can be a long wait.  Well worth the wait.  Wings are a great starter."}
{"text":"Being that Gordan Ramsey is my sons chef hero, my husband and I had to come here.... Just walking up to the fiery entrance was an experience. Very cool!! The wait was just a couple min for two.... The hostess was very kind as was our waitress who was very accommodating to all our (my husbands) questions :) we started with the Hell fire wings. The presentation was fab with curly strips of carrots and blue cheese crumbles. They were great except my husband was wishing for blue cheese dipping sauce as he is a sauce guy. He had a farm burger. It had duck bacon on it. The texture of it is kinda weird soft melt in your mouth. The actual taste of it didn't stand out with the whole burger. It was tasty but not WOW.....my Euro burger was bolder in taste with the truffle sauce and goat cheese on it. Everything tasted really fresh!! It was a great overall experience...."}
{"text":"Third visit to this restaurant, was a miss tonight. The food was not as good as previous visits, not sure I would wait in line again for another visit."}
{"text":"This is the second Gordon Ramsey place I've tried and I can honestly say he's the most overrated celebrity chef. A few years back had drinks and food at LONDON in NYC and it was like, meh. Nothing special, just ok and a little disappointing. Shrugged it off and just resigned myself to the idea that it was better to watch him on TV than to actually go to one of his places....then Vegas happened.   It was late and BurGR was almost the only place open so why not. The place looked great-nice, clean, and modern. Hostess was friendly and our server was really nice. Menu looked interesting and enticing so it seemed like there was hope.   I know it's a burger place (hence the name - duh!) but the hot dogs looked really good so I decided to order one. Bad idea. It took a little long for the food to come out but that's ok. We were in no rush and our server was friendly. Finally our food came and it looked amazing. My plate was huge, looked great and then I took a bite. It was the worst bite of food I've ever had. It was super salty. I mean SUPER SUPER salty. So salty that I almost spit it out like the restaurant's namesake does on TV. I thought it was me so I took another bite and it was confirmed. BLEH....!  I'm not one to complain to a waiter, have food redone or replaced. When the waiter came and asked how everything was my friend insisted I say something so I did. Our server was apologetic and kind. He offered something else and insisted I pick something else. By then I was so turned off I would of honestly preferred a return but graciously accepted a hamburger. He took it away and apologized and told me I was not the first person to complain and that the kitchen was working on the recipe. Really?!? Not the only person to say this and the kitchen is working on this....really?!? (My guess is that they have the hot dogs custom made for the restaurant.) Sorry, with a big name associated with this place I'd think this would of been fixed BEFORE you even opened the doors.    Burger came, was decent but by then my taste buds were so blasted by the salty dog it was pointless. (BTW: If you're ever in NY Shake Shack is the place for a good old fashion juicy burger.)  If you go get the burger, forget the hot dogs until they've improved the recipe."}
{"text":"Despite the long line, it was well worth it to try to one of Gordan Ramsey's restaurants that had great service and delicious food.  Truffle Parmesan Fries: it was wedge cut fries that a had crispy outer texture in every bite and it was even better when they topped it with a heavy serving of freshly grated parmesan. The truffle aioli sauce had the tart/sour taste that complimented the salty fries.  Blue Burger: I opted for a simple burger yet I wanted some richness from the blue cheese. The burger drips natural tummy juices and it was cooked just right.   Service: the hostess didn't seem to enjoy their job but the servers was great and carried on a positive attitude."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place, it is hands down one of the best meals I have ever had in my entire life.  Great burgers and amazing shakes. I prefer this over even Ramsay Steak.  Go!"}
{"text":"Heard so many things about this restaurant so we thought we would give it a try. Yes there was a line but it's worth the wait. We started off with the jalapeño poppers which are served in these cute shot glasses with ranch and a sprinkle of cheese. Which were amazing! Then for the burgers, I ordered the Uber burger and the hubby got the Hog burger, which he states \"is the best damn burger I ever had in my life\". So for all you pork lovers out there that burger is for you. Definitely check out this place next time you are at Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Keep your personal stuff PERSONAL is all I have to say. I don't know if tonight was an off night for the staff, but our server Lauren was horrible. After waiting 15 minutes for a drink menu, she was nowhere to be seen.. FINALLY she comes back, and we got some sob story about how someone's mother died and this is why she took so long to take our order!!! WTF!! My husbands mother passed a few years back and it was NOT good timing on behalf of our server!!! We took this trip in hopes to alleviate some of our stress at home! I am a highly compassionate person, but I do not want to ever hear a story like this when I'm literally just wanting to have a nice dinner , and relax. Hearing this added a level of stress to the meal and dining experience. I watched Lauren take another 15 minutes to enter one tables order, while racing around apologizing to everyone, then neglecting another table for another 15 minutes and they looked raging mad by the time she took their order. I do NOT appreciate being made to feel GUILTY because I'm a guest at a restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out Gordon Ramsay restaurant but it was a disappointment. I wasn't impress with the burgers and they got the meats cooked wrong. The only good thing was the beer."}
{"text":"If I am being honest, I was expecting a bit more glitz and glamor from Chef Ramsay. While the burger was good, nearly a week has passed since I had it and I'm having a hard time articulating what it is that I ate. The french fries were good, just a smidgeon of truffle flavor. Some of my other friends liked the place so much they wanted to go back for a meal the next day ::shrug::  I want to say if I'm staying in Planet Hollywood, I wouldn't mind coming here at all- just can't say it has a solid placement on my must have Vegas dining destinations.  I got to try a bit of their caramel push pops (there was a better name for this). This was good.  Service was also on point. We lined up at 6pm and didn't get in until 7pm- they take down your phone number and text you when it's ready (we ended up getting drinks and riding a bull during the downtime). Next time, I'll make sure to put in my name early if I plan on eating at 6pm.   They also have a cool flame sign out in front, definitely screams Hell's Kitchen."}
{"text":"The best burger ever! I came to Vegas to try all of the ramsey restaurant's, and honesty it was worth the trip and the wait...the line was long! I had the hells kitchen burger and a banana shake. My burger was medium rare. Juicy and fresh. The bun was soft but toasty. However, our food took a while to reach our table.  It was only my husband and I in our party. The couples sitting around us received their food at the same time as us, but arrived after us. I'm not going to lower my rating based on this because it happens. I loved the food and will be back!"}
{"text":"Not worth the expensive price!  Well to be fair, the price is on point when compared to the other burger restaurants in the area.  I didn't love my burger and was appalled at the uniforms that the ladies wear.  I know it's Vegas but why do the guys get to wear jeans and a polo shirt but the ladies have to wear skin tight dresses?  The service was excellent and my husband loved his shake.  The manager was very nice and stopped by our table to ask us how we were doing.    I ordered the Uber Cheeseburger.  It was juicy but not very flavorful, I added salt and pepper to give it some help.  I also added bacon. The bacon was duck bacon and was pretty good.  It's not crispy bacon but that works for me because I like my bacon a little soft.  The burgers are huge and big enough to share (unless you're really hungry).  They give you a TON of fries.  The fries are freshly cut steak fries that comes with their spicy house ketchup and curry ketchup.  Not a fan of the curry but the house ketchup was pretty good.  I was excited to try one of Gordon's restaurants but this one didn't really make the cut in my opinion.  I still want to try out his steak restaurant.  I don't mind paying extra money for steak!  I have an issue with paying that much for a mediocre burger."}
{"text":"The GR on the end of the name is a nice touch and it would be appropriate to use the letters to describe the food.....GReat! The décor is really well thought out right down to the silverware. The service was impeccable and the food was fantastic! Yeah its a BurGR. but the explosions in your mouth of all the great flavors combined set a new standard. We had the onion rings, parmesan truffle fries and we shared 2 of his signature BurGRs. As for the wait, it was not bad at all. You sign in, they text you when its your time to be seated and you drop a few bucks in the casino, No worries! Another WOW for a truly talented and motivated individual. Chef Ramsay thank you for your artistry!!"}
{"text":"The only thing good about the meal was the onion rings.  The french fries where cold when they arrived and the dipping sauces were inedible.  Burger not cooked to desired \"medium well\".  If burgers are what your do, there really should not be any question about when they are done.  With the number of people they serve in a day they should have a well oiled machine, and they didn't.  Disappointed to say the least"}
{"text":"At the Planet Hollywood Casino. There are 2 lines that form, small and large parties. The hostess sorts groups.  We got seated in 10-15 min for a party of 2.  You can take the menu home, the servers were nice and the food came pretty quickly.  Got the onion rings and the truffle fries. The sauces were the HEROES! Their homemade ranch dipping sauce for the onion ring was amazing.  I got the farm burger and the patty was unlike any other burger I have tasted. Moist and tender and the duck bacon was just salty enough. My friend got the truffle burger, also perfectly balanced, not heavy or too rich. The sauce on that was bright and refreshing something citrusy.   The price was not too bad. We sadly didn't have room for dessert but so many people were enjoying milkshakes."}
{"text":"Awesome Hog burger and truffle fries. Went there for lunch, the service was good.  From a recommendation of a friend I tried the Hog Burger which is made from pork. The first bite melts in your mouth and is juicy.  The truffle fries were equally great. I would recommend splitting them with someone as its a big portion."}
{"text":"We went here on my Birthday and it was really good. Expensive, but good. We had steaks and the meat was cooked perfectly. I am not sure if the meat was choice or prime, but it was high quality.  Our check slapped me in the face, so be careful. Two Steaks and one appetizer with a couple of drinks was $270.00. The food was great and one drink I concluded I am not a Bourbon guy.   When you are in Vegas and you select a celebrity's restaurant plan on paying more.   The reason for the four star was everything is very nice, staff is competent, food is really good, but it was too busy and you felt rushed.  I would go there again, but I would use my government issued credit card :-) (kidding)"}
{"text":"I had the Britannia burger and Pamesan/Truffle fries.     Excellent burger, fries were OK, a little too dry for my taste .  Expensive, but that was expected.  Service was slow, for a late lunch (3:00pm).  Cool atmosphere, and presentation."}
{"text":"I loved their burger and shake selections! I got the Oreo cookie Creme Brûlée shake and it was yummy! The shake came way before my burger and unfortunately drinking less than half filled me up before eating. Parmesan french fries were awesome one was enough to share with others on the table. Great atmosphere gets full fast!"}
{"text":"I wanted to not like it because it's kind of obnoxiously American, but my patriot turkey burger over lettuce, instead of a bun, was spectacular. Like best in class. Perfectly seasoned. And I'd run back for one. And they also gave me a ton of refills on my iced tea. Otherwise, service was uninspired."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger I've ever had.   Duck bacon, egg and sharp cheddar cheese. Perfectly cooked. Moist and juicy. Next time, I think I'll add some mushrooms to it.  The fries were also expertly cooked. They had that delicious crispy outside with a soft and chewy inside. Curry ketchup tastes like it sounds. In my opinion, the flavors didn't really go well. I can see the appeal but to me it was more of a gimmick. However, the chipotle ketchup superb.   We also ordered the jalepeno poppers and the presentation was excellent. They were backed up with a solid taste.   Honestly, unless you're a big guy, the burger is enough to fill you just fine. Everyone I saw was leaving their fries at the bar and at first I figured it was because they weren't that good. But in reality it was just because the burger was so dang good and filling. I recommend sharing some fries with a friend unless you're hankering for some food.   I ordered the Jalepeno Margarita (I like it hot what do you want from me?!) and it was a typical 'rita. It wasn't bad but it didn't knock me on my ass like the burger did.   My wife ordered the Green tea gin, now that was an original cocktail with a great taste. i was a huge fan. In fact we came back several hours later and ordered a couple of more for the road.  They have a great selection of beer on tap. I was very impressed with what they had.   We sat at the bar and the service was a bit slow, but it was well worth the wait. Seriously, it was the best burger in terms of meat that I've ever had. Now, I like a burger that's juicy and moist. And this was it. it almost melted in my mouth. If that's not your type of burger, then... you need to have your head evaluated :)"}
{"text":"I was expecting so much more.  I mean it's chef ramsey's name on it.  gordon ramsey.  There was a line outside that was bananas.  I waited in it for about 40 minutes just for a burger.  an average burger at that. I thought with all these people it must be amazing!  no. it wasn't.  I can't take away from the service so I'll give them 5 stars for that but their food was just ok.  We shared the Jalapeño poppers (1 was supposed to be super hot--dont know which it was).  They were good.  Cheesy.  Gigantic pepper.  Deep fried.  Not bad.  I remember the fries were good but I can't tell ya why.  As far as burger: they give you a nice fat patty with a great char and appeal but when you bit into it--it taste so mediocre.  Maybe I'm a burger snob.  I don't know but you can tell the burgers cooked on a grill.  I like burgers cooked on a griddle so it simmers in its own juices.  A grill, the burgers juices fall into the caverns or grill board. It loses it's juiciness and most of its taste.  They dress it up nice. but it's just not enough.  Add to it the zoo you go through just to get a seat...   My overall experience wasn't too great. I probably will not return.  The food isn't good enough to warrant the wait."}
{"text":"Very, very good. So why the 3 stars?   We happened to be in Planet Hollywood ( and hungry) at the time the place opened and were second in line ( ya this place gets long lines which is why I have not been until now)  We had ordered within 5 min of being seated, and it took another 30 min for the food to come. Really? 2 burgers and one order of fries and one of the 1st orders of the day? But- the burger was really good. Would come back if I wasn't starving and if there was no real wait"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.    I love staying at Planet Hollywood.  It's hip and open and not as smokey.  I have wanted to go to BurGR for a while.  The line is always way too long and the tables start to call my name..  So this time, there was no line, and I was hungry and broke from the friggin tables calling me so it was a perfect time to slow my role and eat something good.    Now, the prices were not as high as I thought they would be.  Yes.  A burger probably ran a solid $12 but it's Vegas.  I ordered the burger with the blue cheese.  It was good however we also ordered the wings which i enjoyed even more so than the burger.  The wings, instead of having blue cheese dipping sauce, had actual blue cheese.  Very tasty however a blue cheese overkill.    The hubs got a different burger than me and enjoyed it as well.  Overall, the service was good, the place was clean and I would come back.  I left full and happy.  Now, Back to the tables!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a must try at least once. We waited in line for about 20 minutes for lunch. The hostess that sat us was really friendly and the service overall was very good. We were constantly checked on and our drinks were kept full.   My fiance and I started with the Roasted Jalapeño Poppers. The cheddar bacon, cheddar ranch, one fiery surprise was delicious. Be prepared for spicy! There is one fiery, extra spicy surprise where the seeds are left in a jalapeno, making the popper even more spicy! At around $2 a piece, you receive 5 for $12. Not a bad price!  The burgers did not disappoint! I wouldn't say they are so big you could share, but they are perfect size if you are feeling hungry. I had the American Burger. The meat was cooked to perfection and I didn't have to add any ketchup or mustard, because it was full of flavor! My fiance had the Uber Cheese Burger with 3 different kinds of cheeses and he was very satisfied with the deliciousness. We shared the Garlic Parmesan fries, and these were super tasty!   Overall a little pricey, but it Vegas and it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Took a seat at the Service Counter and saw the Dawgs coming out so changed my mind from a Burger and ordered the Fresh Chili Dawg with Truffle Fried and a Draft. Picking the beer was fun since they give you samples before you decide. When the food came out I was very impressed with the presentation. Service was excellent, dawg and fries excellent and beer cold and fresh. Only issue was that the avocado on the dawg was not ripe and when I pointed it out to the waitress she seemed to care, but did nothing about it. I just took them off the dawg and wondered what Gorden would have done if he were there! Will return on next trip to LV and have a BurGR."}
{"text":"Parking: It's inside the Rio so you just park outside or valet. If you park outside be prepared to walk a good bit.  Service: Great service, friendly staff, food comes out fast.  Food: One of the best burgers I've ever had! Their milkshakes and fries are also amazing, I'd come here every time I revisit Vegas.  overall experience: A+"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The burger I had was the best I've had in along time. I'd recommend this place to everyone. The frys are enough to share for 3 people. The service was excellent too."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. I had wanted to try this place for a couple years and finally made the trip, and I'm glad I did. They don't take reservations, so you may have to wait a while to get in. We showed up on a Thursday around 5pm and were told there would be a 30 minute wait - we actually got in within about 15 minutes. Just grab a beer and wait in line, cuz it's worth it!   The servers were very friendly and informative. They bring the drinks menu on an iPad, which  is kind of annoying - you have to pass it around your table because they only bring one. Are paper menus not cool anymore? Yeesh. Nevertheless, my cocktail was delish.  The burgers are all in the region of $15, and sides are ordered separately (regular fries are $8). I HIGHLY recommend the onion rings. I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger, which was awesome but probably not the BEST burger of all time. Everyone else at my table also loved their burgers.  Then, the dessert. The 'shakes' are amazing. Super thick ice cream with glorious toppings, depending on which one you order (my chocolate shake involved a 2-inch layer of toffee). They're almost impossible to finish, but you gotta try.  All in all this was a great semi-casual dining experience - one of the best places I've eaten in Vegas."}
{"text":"As stated on my profile, the BF and I are obsessed with sir Ramsey. Our dream is to visit all of his restaurants.. this was our first Gordon Ramsey experience..and a very pleasant one. Pro's- Our food was absolutely scrumptious -I got the Earth Burgr and the Bf got the chicken one..we both cried while eating. It's like he knows exactly what the person is looking for taste-wise.. and he invents it.. absolutely amazing food. We got seated fairly quickly and the hostess and manager were very friendly. The decor is obviously beautiful its Vegas meets Gordon Ramsey.. you can't go wrong with that.  Con's- Our waiter was talking TOO fast.. like unbelievably, and he didn't mention the specials they had that day .. we had to overhear him tell the table next to us about it.. WATEV'S. The restrooms are outside the restaurant..not a big deal just a minor walk. The wait for the food is pretty damn long.. but its obviously worth it..my taste buds have been grateful.   I'll be coming back hopefully every time I am in Vegas.. I recommend everyone give this place a try at least one time."}
{"text":"Since Ramsey is such a perfectionist I went into this place looking to critique everything!!  The bottom line- I couldn't complain about anything!!!!  The ambiance, the service, the accommodating attitude, the presentation, the quality of food , the taste-  all were as good as it gets!!  This place as been thought out  and executed to perfection!!!  WAY TO GO RAMSEY-  Someone that walks the talk."}
{"text":"Tammy the waitress was amazing . Make sure u ask for her. Food was also really good!!!"}
{"text":"A carefully crafted delicious burger is all that needs to be said about BURGR the creation of Gordon Ramsey. A great tasting bun with duck bacon and avocado is a great way to enhance the taste. The chicken burger was also extremely tasty.  Ask for Ashley for great service. Reasonable pricing for the Strip"}
{"text":"I'm not one normally to write reviews for anything.  But this one was an exception.  This is my 2nd time trying Burgr. The first time was amazing and I am not even a burger type of girl.  Well this time I was excited to go back to Burgr but it was a huge disappointment. Food was fine but service was needless to say mediocre.  I had a shake with bits pieces of glass sharred in it. I actually bit into the glass and thought it was sugar but realized it was sharp and not melting in my mouth.  Things happen and I get it. But our server did not do anything about it. Yes we obviously got a new shake but nothing else was done. Do I need to personally talk to the manager regarding this issue? I don't think with Gordon Ramsey quality restaurant that a customer need to initiate it. Nonetheless, this was a major disappointment and will never go back."}
{"text":"Had the fish crisps $17. Wasn't impressed. The so called burger bun was a disgusting grease flavored piece of bread. The fish would have been better served without trying to make something fancy. Totally missed the flavor of fish and crisps. Ramsey should have to eat it."}
{"text":"The interior is really nice and the table placemats made it feel official without being the usual casual burger joint. Our waitress was very nice and sweet while giving us great recommendations.  Our table ordered the jalapeno poppers, sweet potato fries, truffle parmesan fries, the American Burger, the Farm Burger, and Hell's Kitchen burger. None of the burgers came iwth fries, which is why we ordered them separately to share (two orders for 5 people). The jalapeno poppers came out really quick in comparison to the burgers. I liked the presentation, with each popper in a glass of ranch. The poppers were good but the outside is thick, like a deep fried consistency.   I ordered the farm burger and it was quite good with the egg being fried enough that the yolk didn't get messy. My parents had the Hell's Kitchen burgers and they liked it enough but the jalapenos were definitely getting really spicy. My two younger sisters had the American burger and it's just as you'd expect a classic burger to taste like. The buns were a good quality with plenty of sesame seeds on them.  The truffle fries were thick cut, almost like wedges but in a straighter shape. They're good when they're warm, but they get hard once they cool down. The first few bites are ok but I think the truffle flavor starts to get overwhelming. If you like the aftertaste of truffle, I'd definitely recommend this. Otherwise it might be wise to avoid or at least share it quickly while it's warm. The upside to these fries was the accompanying ketchup. It was delicious and tasted just like freshly pureed tomatoes without preservatives. I had to request more for my burger because it was so good. The sweet potato fries were as expected: with a dusting of powdered sugar. The jalapeno mayo that came with it didn't really taste like much? But maybe I had too many flavors going on after the truffle fries.  The overall experience was positive and I would definitely go back to try the other burgers."}
{"text":"We waited for over an hour.  The food took forever to be prepared.  The servers were very kind and apologized.  Seats were tooooo low and worn out.   The burger was yummy but not the best I've had.  Overall w wait, comfort, ambience and quality, it's a solid 3 stars. Sorry, Ramsey."}
{"text":"One of the many places we tried while in Vegas for almost a week. Ok, sooooo I didn't actually love this place.  Though our food was good, I expected so much more from MR. RAMSAY.  My honey and I each ordered a burger forgot the name of each of them I know mine had 5 different cheeses, the fries looked large from other peoples orders so we only order one, we also ordered the pigs in the blanket pretty yummy but nothing to rave about.  I also ordered a drink which was pretty darn tasty.  But, the highlight of it all was actually the Aioli sauce they gave us to dip our fries in.  OMG it was soooo good my honey asked if they sold this stuff because we were taking it home...LOL but, that was a no go.  Our waitress I think her name was \"Sarah or Sharon\" she was extremely nice and informative of the menu.  Overall it was a good experience and I might go back!"}
{"text":"Located in Planet Hollywood, Gordon Ramsay Burgr can be found near the front entrance to the right of the Miracle Mile Shop entrance.  There were only 2 in my group, so the wait was not too long.  I'd imagine a larger group would have a longer wait, especially during a peak time.  I had already planned to order fries and a burger.  My waitress told me that the burgers can sometimes take a while to cook, so she suggested that I have my fries come out first so I'd have something to munch on.  Worked for me, but something to note in case you're sensitive about that type of thing.  If you order the sweet potato fries, go ahead and tell your server that you're going to need an extra serving of the honey jalapeno mayo that comes with it.  That stuff alone could get 5 stars.  It is so good.  Also, the order of fries was large enough to share between two people.  For my burger, I ordered the Farm Burger.  It's served with cheddar, duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  In case you missed that, I said duck breast bacon.  This was a delicious burger.    One helpful piece of info, if you are a Total Rewards member and show your card, you can get special pricing that comes out to a $1 off several items.  It's free to join at the Total Rewards desk found in the casino."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas and being a bit of a Ramsay fan, thought this would be a great spot for a casual meal.  I stopped in on a Tuesday evening, you access it via the front lobby of Planet Hollywood.  There was already a line of maybe 40 people at around 7pm but being on my own I was able to just wander into the back bar overlooking the kitchen which was a great place to hang out and see the various menu options up close before ordering.  While perusing the cool looking menu you also get to grab a beer and watch in admiration at the sheer quantity of food going out as regular as clockwork...an impressive operation.  I typically like to order an appetizer while deciding upon an entree to space out the food service, so as soon as I saw the onion rings - a perennial favorite of mine- I had to have them. They were excellent, that steakhouse style crispy fall-off the-onion beer batter version - not those awful frozen breaded things you get in so many chain restaurants.  As a main course I tried the farm burger, it has duck bacon and a fried egg as toppings and it was the best burger I've ever tasted, period.  Being a single diner that night and happy to just pull up a stool to the bar without a wait, this place was a great experience for me.  Living 3000 miles away I just need to recreate that farm burger...once I find myself some of that elusive duck bacon..."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Our burgers were phenomenal, loved the atmosphere, the prices were reasonable, service fast! We will be returning on our next trip for sure! Highly suggest the jalapeño poppers as an appetizer, comes with a little surprise!"}
{"text":"One of if not the best burger I have had the Britannia Burger was so damn good. I thought I was dreaming. I sent compliments to the chef and the manager. Thank u again I am gonna come back to Vegas just for that."}
{"text":"The wait to be seated can be short or long depending on your luck. Didn't have to wait much except to get our burgers which were pretty darn good. If I see a short waiting line again, I'm chowing down a burger for sure."}
{"text":"I love watching Hell's Kitchen so of course I had to make a stop here when I was in Vegas! The decor of the place had a touch of 'hell' with the wall of fire in front of the restaurant.   Luckily, we didn't have to wait that long and was seated right away. We were starving and instantly ordered truffle Parmesan fries and burgers. We got the farm burger and Hell's Kitchen burger. The fries were delicious! Crispy and very flavorful because of the truffle! Noms. The farm burger with the duck breast bacon and egg inside a brioche bun was fabulous, and the Hell's Kitchen burger really packs heat with the roasted jalapeños. I loved it!   I regret not ordering the sticky toffee pudding, but I was so stuff from all the food already. Guess it'll be on my bucket list when I go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"AMAZING burgers, shakes and fries ! The hype is REAL.  Burgers were cooked to perfection and the truffle fries had so much flavor w/ the perfect amount of garlic bits and parmesan cheese!  I will make a stop here each time I am in vegas."}
{"text":"For a man who gets his panties in a bunch every time the kitchen lags on getting orders out, his restaurant sure was slow.  We were told there would be a 25 minute wait.  We waited longer than that.  they pretty much told everyone there was about a 25 minute wait.  If you're standing an additional 4 people behind us, and we were told it would be 25 minute wait, i'm pretty sure you will have to wait even longer.  If you are a total rewards or diamond member however, you get preferred seating.  Unfortunately, i could not find my stupid card, and the only way you can use it is if you have in on hand.   Food also took a good amount of time to come out... the couple sitting beside us didn't get their food until a good 15-20 minutes after we sat down.  Make sure you're not in a rush when you visit, just in case service is slow!   With that said, boyfriend and I were really excited about Burgr.  We started off with a Guinness and a Sierra Mist.  The only reason I even mention the Sierra Mist is because it's a Pepsi product, and a good majority of Vegas establishments use only Pepsi products, including Burgr :[  makes me super sad, as i'm all about Coca Cola.  But, moving on.    We ordered the Britannia (English Cheddar, Mango Chutney, and Arugula) and the Chanterelle (Chanterelle mushrooms, argular, figgy onion jam).  Both pretty good, but also very alike.  The only huge difference we noted was the mushrooms.  Makes sense.  Both had the Arugula and both were slightly sweet from the chutney and the jam.  The meat was super juicy and cooked medium.  Melted right in your mouth!  Also, I've noticed comments on the size of the burgers.  Honestly, I only managed to eat a little more than half.  The burgers are pretty heavy, which makes you feel fuller faster than you normally would.  Of course the order of truffle fries that we shared probably added onto the fullness.  Best truffle fries ever!  I'm usually not a fan of steak fries, but man, these were crispy and delicious!  I was really set on ordering a shake, but honestly, glad I didn't.  Had no room left for anything else, and was already feeling kind of sickly full.  All in all, for the 2 burgers, truffle fries, beer and soda our bill came out to about 55 (pre tip).  With tip we spent around 66ish  for 2.  Would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic, the sweet potato fries are to die for. They almost tasted like candy. Server recommended the \"Hell's Kitchen Burger\" which was the \"basic\" choice of burgers. It was sized very decently, temperature was perfect and my only complaint is I wish it already had ketchup on it, it tasted a bit \"dry\" without any condiments.  Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere and the experience."}
{"text":"So I'm probably not the first one to say I went here just to see what GR is all about! He talks so much about how great he is so I had to prove him right or wrong. He was right! I loved it! I didn't think burgers and dogs could be so different. Plus it also helped that the service was phenomenal! Ask for Alex with the glasses but be warned...you won't be allowed to order what you want! Lol! He wouldn't let me get plain fries and insisted on getting the truffle fries and he was so right! He made my visit very memorable. He entertained us and I got to meet basically all the staff! He told us how great GR was and that he's nothing like the prick they try to make him seem. Personally I think the guy is so level headed and straight forward just like his menu here. The bun was toasted just right for my dog and the sausage had a kick to it that was pretty f-ing incredible. It was just good food. I will go back every time I'm in Vegas! Thanks Alex!!!"}
{"text":"Delicous burger. Size was a bit smaller but every bite is heaven. French fries was awesome as well. The ambient is top notch.   I ordered a few rum and cokes and they were real strong - must for being $10/piece."}
{"text":"Obviously, you're paying more because you're in Gordon Ramsey's  restaurant. We went on a Friday night during springs break - the wait was a while but shorter than I expected. The quality of the meat was too both. Fries were okay...they tasted like they had been sitting for a while. The sweet Maui onion rings were heaven."}
{"text":"My friend and I split a burger and we're both fans. The burger was made perfectly. As my friend described it, \"it was a different kind of soft\" what ever that means. He may have been talking about the buns. If I was going to complain about anything is that I was born with too small of a mouth to eat that big of a burger. I also ordered truffle fries which were also good. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I was craving a burger and decided to stop into GR Burgr.   I really felt that details were missed when we stopped in last night. Like everyone else there was a wait, although I did see a few empty tables that I was curious about why they weren't just seating people there.   First of all, I didn't really like how the menu didn't describe any of the meat or anything. It was just pretty basic and listed the ingredients. I didn't know what type of beef they used, I still don't know at this point.   Ordered the Euro burger medium rare, but got it well done. I was too tired and hungry to have them remake it. The flavors of the burger were just OK. It came with goat cheese, arugula, truffle aioli, and a roasted tomato. I dont think the flavors were that distinct and the burger just seemed mediocre. The burger itself wasn't that thick.   I really liked the truffle fries though. I liked the truffle on it and the aioli-- But I won't go back just for the fries.   The ambiance was supposed to be that of a sport bar but it just seemed like a restaurant with a bunch of TVs. I did not feel like it'd be comfortable for going to watch a game t here.   The employees were either not knowledgeable about the food or did not care to describe any of it to us.   I won't be back when I'm craving a burger. I'd rather go back to burger bar or bachi"}
{"text":"The most expensive burger so far that I've eaten. The most delicious one is Farmbuger. If you come here, definitely try it.  Fries was just okay, nothing exciting to pay $10 for, we got the Truffle Parmesan fries. Didnt even get to finish it. We ordered: fury chicken wings- delicious!, hell's kitchen burger-average, the euro burger was pretty good. Their meat was cooked perfectly and so tasty! Last but no least, we ordered the shake #4, creme brulee pudding, oreo shake, oreo cookie...omg...this was awesome!! This went perfect with our meal!"}
{"text":"I ordered the regular burger and thought it was just Okay. The fries were the frozen variety and they only had truffle ketchup which I dislike. Iced tea was $4.   My wife had the \"Hell's Kitchen Burger\"  and really liked it. That saved it from getting a 2 star rating from me. I have absolutely no desire to revisit."}
{"text":"REALLY GOOD!  We visited this place this past weekend and had a blast! Our waiter Alex was a hoot! He had a laughing during our entire meal. The food was excellent. Between the 3 of us we ordered the American burger (traditional), the Hell's Kitchen burger with jalapeno and avocado, and the Chicken burger with blue cheese. Every single burger was delish! Plus we ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries and Alex brought us all the different kinds of ketchup: regular, curry, and chipotle. One thing I will say is that chipotle ketchup set my chicken burger off! I highly recommend this place if you are ever in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This has to be the most amazing burger I have ever had \"Hells Kitchen\" the jalapeño poppers also insanely good"}
{"text":"Waited until after my second time at Burgr to write this review, and I have to say this is the most delicious burger I've ever had. Burgr is inside Planet Hollywood though the hotel does not have clear signs to direct you there.   For a restaurant directly on the strip, the price is not bad, each burger about $15 or so. The order of burger does not include any sides or fries, so you must order this on the side, and I highly recommend the truffle fries. The truffle fries are out of this world and worth every penny.   There is usually a line to get in, but if you are an m life member you can also get in an alternate line."}
{"text":"We went in last night for a friends Birthday. We Drove up form California  because that's what He wanted. Well it was not what I expeated for a Gordon Ramsay restraint's. The services was great. They had our food there on time and it was hot and some what good. I order the  Blue burger and some type of garlic fries. the burger was ok but the Fries did not sit well with me and I got sick when I get home. Not a fun time at all.They were very greasy and if I'm right when I see him on TV he would of yelled at someone and then throw them back and say FIX IT!!! Well I throw them all right. UP!! not a fan at all.  Then when we told the waiter it was our friends Birthday does he get a something. he then side it someone it going to pay for it under his breath. We just looked at him and left. We paid $430.00 for 13 of us and that is what he has to say. NOT cool!  I wish I got his name.   I will give a big shout out to the people who brought our Food. They were great! :) Knew who order what and told us what we order. and they had a smile at all time. Great team work there."}
{"text":"First Thoughts: We're going to be raging with Gordon Ramsey tonight?   To answer the question: yes and no. My bf and I raged at BurGR but Ramsey was not in attendance to see it. Hopefully, he'll get a chance to read about it in this review.   We got to BurGR around 7 pm and waited between 40-45 minutes--to be seated at the bar. Beware. BurGR does not take reservations and they operate on a first come first serve basis. Be prepared to wait between the hours of 4-9 pm. I had called earlier in the day to try and make reservations only to be told to come after 9 pm--when the crowds start dying down.  We were seated after only waiting 40 minutes because we opted to sit at the bar. Had my bf and I opt for a table, our wait would have been much longer. The bar area has several large TV screens tuned to sports channels so if you enjoy sports, it's something to consider. Also, the bar chairs are glued into the ground with an awkward space in-between. If you are on a date, you will not be sitting physically close to your date at the bar.   Once seated, my bf ordered the Euro burger and I ordered the granny apple Caesar salad with dressing on the side. We were offered our waters and we waited another 10-15 minutes for our food.   The one word I would use to describe the food: underwhelming. My salad was just a pile of greens with slices of apples placed on top with some pieces of Parmesan cheese and croutons sprinkled throughout. It was unimpressive and tasted like any other Caesar salad, with or without granny apples. My salad was hardly justified by its exorbitant price of $12. Especially, when I know I could have purchased the same salad at Trader Joes for half the price.   My bf's burger looked better but after a few bites, he said his burger was dry and well done, not medium, which was what he had asked for. I tried some of the meat and agreed: it was well done, not medium.   Bottom line: This was a rookie's mistake and unacceptable in a well-established Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Paired with my ordinary salad, the burger was not up to par with a restaurant only specializing in burgers. If this is their niche, they need to step up quality control and not let this happen in the future. I will not be returning for more sad salads, over done burgers and long lines.    *End rage."}
{"text":"Amazeballs USA!!!! TO. DIE. FOR. The best burger I've ever had! Great service, great drinks and I had a When Harry Met Sally Moment with my meal choices. Sweet potato fries with vanilla powered sugar and the honey jalapeño sauce. Normally I can't eat anything with jalapeño because I'm allergic but I COULD NOT STOP eating this deliciousness. I ordered the Uber cheese burger- fontina, raclette, and goat cheese. Again, AMAZING. Finally, I had the #3 shake-Butterscotch pudding with banana, walnut, strawberry, and chocolate. OH. MY. GOSH!!!!!! Love shack! I am still thinking of this meal the next day and want to go back for a repeat performance!!!! Thank you Gordon Ramsay! You are a freaking genius!"}
{"text":"The food was great and so were the prices.  It may not have been the best burger I've had in my life, but the bun was delicious and the sides were also.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Food was great, experience . . . not so much.  The 1.5 hour quoted wait time ballooned to nearly 2.5 hours. We had the cornmeal crusted fried chicken app and it was fantastic. Unfortunately, the kitchen or server lost our ticket so that was another 30 minute wait for the re-fire.  Burgers were perfectly prepared and seasoned. Truffle fries were good.   We had to wait another 15 minutes for the server to return with the credit card after paying.   So . . . service would be 1 star, food . . . 4. It's worth trying out for sure."}
{"text":"I love all the different combos of flavors and the prompt service is amazing every time i go there even though they were busy as heck we were seated within minutes. im not a fan of goat cheese i am always getting to tangy of a flavor but this goat cheese burger was sooooo good really creamy and smooth with subtle tangy-ness that slowly builds and the meat is so juicy cooked medium and perfect."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  Gordon's TV shows drive a lot of people to this restaurant, it is a low cost way to try out his food.  Frankly it was a poor experience.  The burgers sounds great when you read the menu,  but the burgers that arrived where not very good at all. My burger was served in a Kaiser style bun, but the bun was not fresh it was somewhat stale and very dried out. The burger itself was over cooked dried out and tasteless. It was also too thick , shaped like a somewhat flattened ball of dried out grey meat.  If I had guests at my home and my burgers turned out like that I would ask them to wait another 20 mins while I cooked up a fresh batch.  Save yourself some time ,money and disappointment,  go to a fast food place at least their burgers wont be served on old nasty buns , and dry as a bone.  it felt very touristy, very much like it was designed by committee."}
{"text":"Really delicious burger. I got the farmer burger and the runny egg with duck breast bacon on top of burger was so so good!  It was juicy and perfectly cooked. I got mine medium and it was perfect.   The onion rings and the truffle fries were delish as well. The onion rings had great batter on them and was crispy and seasoned just right. The truffle dipping for thr fries were really yummy as well. What can I say?  They were well worth the money. I know some people mentioned in their reviews that the burger was expensive but hell, they aren't no McD burgers. I can still taste the buttery taste of the buns.   It only gets 4 stars because of the hot dawg. It was very very salty. My little son who loves hot dog could not finish it and after I tasted it, I could see why.  Even though the server was nice, the service was just a touch slow. The restaurant was really packed so maybe that's why.   Definitely will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I got the farm burger ($15)- comes with egg, duck breast bacon, and cheddar. The bun was toasty and delicious, the meat was PERFECT, the egg was soft but not runny, and I've never had duck before but it was salty and way above regular bacon. I'm no culinary expert but all I can say was that it was delicious. Actually, it was one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten in my entire life. Gordon Ramsay really knows what he's doing! The fries were legit fries- really thick cut, not oily, and so hot and fresh that we had to wait to eat them! The ketchup is really unique, I've never tried anything like it. Highly recommended if you're in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"From the time you arrive to the time you leave you will be satisfied.  The fire out front pulled us right in and when I saw Gordons huge head everywhere I knew I had to check it out.  We were sat immediately and right next to the fire display which was awesome.  The waitress was quick and attentive.  We ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger and the Chanterelle Burger and they were both amazing.  The Hells Kitchen burger is spicy and the chanterelle has a sweet taste because of the onion jam.  You only need to order one side trust me.  We got the truffle parmesan fries with homemade truffle aioli and homemade ketchup.  We were so full at the end but our waitress talked us into the sweet toffee pudding pops that you can take with you.  That was the hightlight cause they are that good.  We also got to keep our menus which was also a very cool touch.  The part that made me laugh was that our bill was $60 and we gave her a $100 and she actually asked if we needed change.  Hahaha, seriously?   She was nice but not worthy of a 65% tip.  I guess they are used to getting tipped way too much for just being a server in Vegas cause that was pretty extreme."}
{"text":"A 5 Star Gourmet Burger all the way! I had the Sweet Potato Fries and they were great. My husband raved about the Jalapeno poppers. Of course we had the sticky toffee pudding pops for dessert\ and they did not disappoint!  Cons: There will most likely be a wait if you go during your average lunch/dinner time so plan for that, there is first come/first serve seating at the bar area.  Overall great place to dine!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had anywhere. The service was good and food was even better. On the pricy side but worth going if your in Vegas. Fries feed 3 with a order"}
{"text":"im vouching for an 8 man bachelor party. Best burger in town. Hands down. And Damn good coffee. Best part was our service. Our waitress,  Hillary, was one of our trip highlights. best service we recieved all weekend. Glasses full and kept us smiling. I would highly recommend anyone dinning at ramsey burgerto request hillary as your server. You will have a blast! Thanks Hillary!!"}
{"text":"OMG. I LOVED this place! We were out pretty late and got hungry, so decided to split a burger. It was AMAZING. Although I found it weird that the burger didn't come with fries - it was a first for me, I can honestly say that the fries were the best I have ever had... we ordered the truffle fries and they were topped with parmesan cheese. Not a single soggy fry - perfectly crispy and amazing seasoning. We had a the push-up dessert pops, which were just okay. Next time I'll go with the servers suggestion of the toffee or oreo shake. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have a general rule for celebrity chef restaurants: the more obviously it is named after any particular chef, the lower-ranked it is it is in that chef's lineup. Gordon Ramsay BurGR, then, is obviously pretty low on his list of giving-a-damn-ness, given that he has not one but TWO references to himself in the name. There's also the tacky menu cover, which is just a giant picture of himself posing like he's a delighted gay man opening up his first superbly-well-endowed package. This place is total crap. The burgers are crap. The fries are boring (and are crap). The ketchup tries way too hard (and is crap). The beers were warm (and crap). The atmosphere is a cleaner version of a fast-food joint. The saving-it-from-one-star grace is that the workers were very friendly and laid back. But I really would rather spend my money at McDonald's. Or Burger King. Or Jack in the Box. Wherever, just not here."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a great burger? Well I decided to give this place a try when I was shopping in the mall inside planet Hollywood. The line out front was crazy long so I opted to get my food to go. The hostess took my order promptly and correctly which can sometimes be an issue because I like to modify my food, especially when there's lots of specialty items u can substitute. They texted me when my food was done. It was delicious, hot, and ten minutes faster then the time they had quoted me. The truffles fries were seriously amazing. The price was about average for a good burger joint, and the fries portion was huge. I'll definitely be back to try another burger. The euro was bomb. Overall they did a great job. Besides the food being fast and tasty, service was excellent even though they were extremely busy. Plus when I walked up to the host stand my good was already there with all the proper condiments and necessities like napkins etc. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Been here before but thought we'd bring the family. Well if you have a party greater than 3, you have to check in at the counter because for a party if 6, we had a special wait of 2 hours when it they could have split us into two parties of 3 so we could have had lunch at a decent hour. The hostesses aren't too bright in making that suggestion or they just don't care. All they do is move 3 tables together!  It's not like there's a special room for large parties. This has really turned me off, esp since my husband and I have come here a dozen times-- but then there was only 2 of us."}
{"text":"Epic! Barn burger with sweet potato fries cannot be missed! Need larger wine/beer list."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I ever tried. Definitely recommend this place to any visitor in Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Make sure you're prepared to wait! We waited for a table for an over, then it took almost an hour to get our food. By the time we were seated the restaurant wasn't too busy, it just seemed like they didn't have enough servers.  Let me start by saying this is an expensive burger and fries...but it was delicious!! My friend and I each ordered a burger but decided to share an order of fries. The fries were delicious and one order was enough for both of us. The burger was also delicious...but I can't say it was worth $18.  One thing I really liked was the use of technology in the restaurant. When you put your name on the wait list, they ask for your phone number so they can text you when your table is ready. (love that!) This was nice because we were able to walk about the Miracle Mile shops without having to worry about a pager being too far from the restaurant. Also, each table gets an ipad with the menu on it...very cool."}
{"text":"I have got to say one of the best burgers I have ever eaten out. I had the Truffle Parmesan Fries and Chanterelle burger with figgy onion jam. Dear God he needs to sell that figgy onion jam. I just love saying it. Figgy onion jam. I hesitated with it but glad I delved in. The fries are enough for a whole table and absolutely delicious. The service was slow but friendly and courteous and didn't ignore us."}
{"text":"The American burger was INCREDIBLE! Definitely the best burger I've ever had. We also had another burger with jalapeños and just fries. Both were decent. The onion rings were great!"}
{"text":"Great burger to die for a1 service love this place price was great as well worth going to over and over"}
{"text":"Simply excellent!  Had the wings - great!  Also had the Hell's Kitchen burgr ... Fantastic!!  Juicy, perfectly cooked... And I highly recommend the onion rings.  I didn't have anything I didn't like.   And if you don't want to wait in line...there is plenty if room at the bar for quick seating.  Service was great - thanks Wendy!"}
{"text":"Best part of our whole trip was eating here!! I've always wanted to eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant then I saw Christina was the exec chef I had to eat here. We even got the best seats in the house at the counter watching the chef.   Garrett was our server and just made our experience so incredible! We even got the busy Christina to sign my menu - it was a great birthday!   The hostess was really rude because we weren't silver club members or whatever but don't let her be the reason not to eat here, the place is amazing! My favorite item was the fury wings. Thank you Garrett and Christina for this unforgettable experience! Now if I can only time it next time to meet Gordon Ramsey!!"}
{"text":"After all the hoopla about Gordon Ramsey, we decided to give this place a try - BIG MISTAKE !!!  Definitely not one of the top 100 places to eat in Las Vegas.  The service was poor, the coffee was cold, and the food was expensive and not worth the price.  Definitely will never come back here for a meal."}
{"text":"Favorite burger joint. Truffle fries dipping sauce was spectacular.!"}
{"text":"The service is very enthusiastic, eager to introduce most of the more \"interesting\" items on the menu. Our waitress also gave various recommendations, which made selections from the menu a bit less daunting.   We ordered the following:  -Beer battered Maui Onion Rings  Very good, when paired with the condiments, it may be one of the best onion rings I've ever had. Does not have too much batter and still has enough onion; very well balanced.  -Truffled Fries  Has the faint scent and taste of truffles.  Very well balanced, as the truffle does not overwhelm the fries, but definitely helps elevate the overall quality of the fries. Very good.  -Hog Burger  A great and ingenious burger. They were able to couple the smokiness of the grill and the richness of the pork to produce a very well balanced burger. It tasted a bit like Chinese roasted pork belly, but the richness is mellowed by the house made mayonnaise. The smokiness of the porky patty was just amazing, the balance with the sesame bun and the arugula... just great.  Gordon Ramsay definitely knows what he doing!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has gotten some bad reviews, but the few times I've been here, it's been great! The BurGr's are amazing, and the service is great! The jalenpeno poppers are a favorite, as well as the parm fries!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favourite restaurants in Vegas, the wait in line was 15 to 20 mins, but it was well worth it.  We had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Farm Burger, along with the Truffle Fries, all of which was recommended by our very friendly server.  He also came to refill water constantly and was very hard working and organized.  Both burgers were tasty and different from others we've had before, the parm truffle fries were amazing and a large portion that's great for sharing.  Dipping sauces were very good as well, not your regular garlic aioli and ketchup, it has some special flavour to it.  The fiery window display with the GR name is also a nice touch for tourists like ourselves to take photos with, nice interior inside as well.  Tip: go earlier if you are a group, wait could be over 30mins.  For couples the line goes pretty fast and wait is not too bad."}
{"text":"It Was ok I mean for the hour and fifteen minutes I waited in anticipation but the burger was rather dry,I got the farm house burger,the fries were ok surprisingly they came out fresh but it's nothing major here,won't go back against though!"}
{"text":"May have to wait but I have Seven Stars with Caesars. Get to cut the line and seated with priority. It took me a couple tries before I finally found the right burger for me."}
{"text":"The best part of BurGR is the fire display at the door, because it's all downhill from there on in. The waiter came up trying to sell us on cocktails, when we just wanted waters, that was the end of customer service. 15 minutes later my bf ordered a Coke so we can finally get 2 glasses of water, while tables that were seated after us got their paid drinks in no time. Then there's the food, which took about 45 minutes. Since when did chef Ramsy's kitchen tolerate this type of service? The restaurant was full but very few tables had food, a lot of folks had folded arms and a hangry look, while 4 waiters were standing around together chatting! I finally got fed up and told our waiter to check on our order, it's been half an hour. His response was that's normal, usually takes the kitchen 20-25 minutes. EXCUSE ME?! First of all, don't be defending slow service to an already upset customer, secondly, 20-25 minutes has come and gone! When the food finally showed up 45 mins later, it was not bad but not spectacular, definitely not worth my time. The onion rings and blue burger were drenched in too much salt. No tip and never coming back!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch during a business trip. Burgers were amazing and the truffle fries and sweet potatoes fries were too. Defintely the best burger I had on my trip and I had a few. The sauces that came with the fries were outstanding. Did not expect to like this place so much....but I did!"}
{"text":"Came here upon a friend's recommendation, but I had my doubts. I thought BurGR would be yet another overhyped celebrity chefstaurant (e.g., Gordan Ramsay at the London Weho), starting with the douchey servers in those awful uniforms.   But BurGR proved me wrong with an absolutely perfect blue cheese burger--super minimal with just a medium rare patty, blue cheese and arugula--and a really awesome shake. I have no idea whose idea it was to top a crazy-rich milkshake with a complementary, equally indulgent pudding, but it's genius.   I don't know if I'd wait for hours to eat here, but if you can snag a table without too much effort, definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday afternoon (~1-2pm) with no line ahead of us, but an almost packed dining room. Menus are part of the table settings, while the waitresses have iPads to show the drink and dessert options. Additionally, when you receive your check, there is an attached iPod Touch asking for you to answer a few rating/review type questions. Very high-tech! The hostess leading us to our table was polite, asking if we were enjoying our stay in Vegas, and making short conversation so it wasn't just an awkward \"follow me\" situation. Our waitress was very nice, explained to us the restaurant specials and that burgers usually took ~12 minutes to cook. Everything came out in a timely manner, nothing incorrect with our order. The burgers are very juicy and loaded with various toppings, which I feel takes away from the \"meat flavor\" of the burger a little, but delicious nonetheless. Truffle fries are served with two dipping sauces, a light house-made ketchup(?) and a thick and creamy aioli. The fries themselves I thought were a bit on the dry side. We ordered a Shake #5, coffee shake with chocolate hazelnut pudding, topped with a praline cookie. I was pleasantly surprised the cookie was actually quite tasty, while if you mix the shake and pudding together, it tastes almost like a frozen custard, very good~ Since it's located right next to the casino of Planet Hollywood, be prepared for the occasional waft of cigarette smoke, but honestly, I think most of Vegas has that smell."}
{"text":"Perfection.  The way all the flavors are brought together yum. Love the sweet potato fries also."}
{"text":"Order shakes to go. They lost our order and 30 mins later is just a stupid apology and 0 shakes. Horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Yes, Mr. Ramsay, you've hit the spot.  It is very difficult for me to finish my whole meal at times. Especially, when the burgers are bigger than my face. However, I had absolutely no problem finishing my Southern Yardbird Burger. I ate and I ate and I ate and I finished. I don't think I looked up once to check of my friends were still at the table.   Also, the fries there are a must! HOW CAN YOU HAVE A BURGER WITHOUT FRIES!?!?  The restaurant was reasonably priced. I took $50 for my meal just in case and I only spent $20 including tip. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Had the farm burger and truffle fries, honestly it was \"meh.\"  waited over 40 minutes at the table and when the food came the burger was so sub-par . Meat was tough, flavor was simple. I swear In-N-Out makes a tastier, and juicier burger than this. Truffle fries tastes rubbery, were cold and all you could taste was cheese. Don't come here its not worth your money and time, there are far better restaurants in Las Vegas to pour your money into."}
{"text":"The burgers here are really good, but they can be a bit pricey.  My brother and I each got a burger, coke and we split an order of fries.  Our bill was almost $50.    We DID happen to see Gordon Ramsay there while we were eating at the counter.  I must say I was surprised that he was so friendly to all of his employees.  He shook everyone's hand, posed for some photos and was pleasant.  Gordon had a seat in one of the booths and ate lunch with a couple of guys that were with him.  He spoke with fans and posed with photos with them as well.  Even though we placed our order about 15 min before he arrived, somehow he seemed to get his food first.  Hmmmmm......"}
{"text":"Big fan of Gordon Ramsay. Excited to try his Burgr restaurant. Ordered the Maui Onion Rings, which we enjoyed very much. Good portion, light batter and not greasy. Also liked the Chipotle Ketchup that came with it, but small narrow sauce cups don't really work with large onion rings...can't dip the rings without cutting or crushing them. Hell's Kitchen Burger was also good, and the jalapeno chilies really pack the heat. Don't order the Soba Chicken Salad...a huge disappointment. If the server had actually come around to ask how they were while we were still eating, we would have sent it back. The noodles were overcooked, clumpy and sticky. On Master Chef, I'm sure the judges would have dumped this dish in the trash."}
{"text":"I honestly don't think Gordon Ramsey himself would've put up with the wait for food here.  The line to get seated wasn't too bad in the early afternoon, but it took over 40 minutes for 4 burgers and one order of fries to come out! Despite the wait, my Hell's Kitchen Burger (grilled jalapeños, jalapeño aioli, fancy cheese, avocado, & beef) was pretty tasty. It was a tad too tall to be normal bite size, but that's just a personal preference. An order of gooey (?) fries came with egg, cheese, truffle oil, and some type of cured meat. It would've been a lot tastier if it came out before the burgers!   My group may have experienced a bout of hanger while waiting, and I ordered a shake since I desperately needed something in my stomach. Maybe that was their plan all along!! The coffee shake was tasty at first, with the occasional chunk of chocolate pudding, but it's kind of sad that nearly a quarter of the shake goes to waste as the pudding makes it stick to the sides of the super narrow glass.   In the end, it's a bit more than a decent burger. I probably wouldn't say it's worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Had the American Burger was okay. My husband really enjoyed it. Had the Truffle frys and really didn't like them. My husband thought they were ok. Overall we would come back."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger fan but my boyfriend is, so in the 100+ degree heat on our last day in Vegas we had to find this place no matter what (it's located in the casino of Planet Hollywood). Especially because it's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant we had high expectations and my expectations were met *for the burger only*.  I got the Euro burger with added avocado. Avocado was very fresh and actually had a present taste in the burger, it wasn't overpowered by the sauce or other fillings, each condiment blended together extremely well. Even the bun was fluffy.   My bf got Hell's Kitchen burger. Ironically, he was the one who was very unsatisfied with his burger. Thought it was plain, too plain, in-n-out would've been better for him.   But the fries were awful. They tasted stale. We addressed it to the waitress who took the fries off our bill. Again, in-n-out fries would've been better. Haha. But seriously speaking,  I saw a couple of other reviews talking about stale fries. Personally, I don't think it matters that much they took it off our bill (although it's better than not taking it off at all), but they're already making bank so it probably isn't a big deal to them. Under Ramsay's name, they should seriously work on the fries if more than a few customer complained about it already.  Overall, service was okay but the food took a while to come out. Over 30 minutes. I do recommend my burger!!!"}
{"text":"$16 for a burger full of hormones ! No thanks. Please Mr. Ramsay consider spending the extra couple cents to get healthier meat. Ambiance was nice.."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, great Belgian fries. Even the hot dogs and chicken wings are amazing. And yes, they have good salads too. Top it off with a craft beer on top from their list of 25+ great ones, and you have one amazing meal. Everything is made to perfection and the wait staff is helpful, because I'm sure Gordon yells at them if they get it wrong. One of my favorite Las Vegas restaurants, even if you have to wait in line."}
{"text":"This is the best burger and fries I have ever had! We ordered the Euro burger and Parmesan truffle fries. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Food: A+ Jalapeno poppers: were SO delicious and crispy. can not describe how beautiful it was, the little shot glasses with dipping sauce was perfect. especially with gordon ramsay's \"special\" surprise haha. Nice touch. Delicious to look at, delicious to eat. No exaggeration.  Burgers were really really rich and filling, very delicious. Nicely seasoned. Didn't need ketchup or anything.  Service: A+ After reading the reviews, thought the seating would be terrible; it wasn't we were sat right away. Service was impeccable. I would say I have never received better service anywhere else. Didn't check in too often, server was very knowledgeable in foods and drinks and our food runner presented the food really well. Pre-bussed our food right away; I mean what else can you ask for.  This place was excellent."}
{"text":"The Hell's Kitchen Burger I had was positively phenomenal. I am a huge fan of good burgers, and the chefs at this Gordon Ramsay restaurant sure know how to make a good burger. The juicy meat was cooked perfectly, and the generous amount of avocado and slice of jalapeño on top complimented it well.  We were told that the wait was about an hour long, but one of the greeters asked us for contact info and sent us a text when a table was ready. I received the text in a little less time than was expected, and we were greeted very pleasantly on arrival. The waitstaff was very efficient and timely, and the decor is pretty cool, with a fire display up front.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Got there 20 minutes to opening on a Thursday and there were already 5 people in line.  Maui onion rings with chipotle ketchup = AMAZING.  Good beer and cocktail list.  The blue burger was sour and tangy.  The hells kitchen burger was great.  The just fries were nothing special.  Not worth $70 for two beers, two burgers, one fry and one rings.  I would return for the rings and ketchup only."}
{"text":"Everything was spot on. From the beer selection, to the menu, to the staff, to the food. We sampled the burgers, shakes, onion rings, shakes, and fries. Every item was prepared perfectly. It was everything we had expected it to be. Great job BurGR staff. We would come back if ever in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Very fresh vegetables, fantastic quality foods, awesome sangria. Employees are good enough  kind, nice, and friendly, but don't expect too much for great service. Just fine customer service."}
{"text":"Table of 6 and all our burgers were amazing! Our server Alex made our first experience here perfect!"}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to Yelp expectations! I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and I have wanted to try this place for sooooo long. I was surprised they don't take reservations, but it is okay because it is more than worth the wait. I noticed the line is much longer for parties of 2 (I'm not too sure why), but we were a group of 3 so around 2:00 the wait for us was only 5 minutes thankfully!   The set up is very trendy and you can see the casino from the restaurant. I loved the fire designs going around the restaurant, they were very cool.  So so many different burger options. The best part is, you can make any burger with the vegetarian portobello patty or a turkey burger patty. I got the euro burger replaced with the portobello patty and added avocado. The burger was delicious and made with amazing quality. However, I was surprised to see it is $4 to add only a few slices of avocado in a burger (I guess that's what you get for being in a Vegas casino). The truffle fries were delicious and I recommend them to anyone who loves their fair share of garlic and truffle :)   I will be back here many many times in the future and I recommend this yummy restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife had the Hell's Kitchen burger and I had the pork burger, we split an order of the truffle fries.  The pork burger was good but the size of the patty was way off. It was enormous, and it dwarfed the rest of the burger and made it difficult to eat. Splitting the 1.5\" thick patty into two patties would have been better, but the flavors were good. The Hell's Kitchen burger was absolutely forgettable. I really can't believe a Michelin starred chef approved this. It was bland, with a tiny beef patty, and really nothing else going for it. Holstein's across the street at the Cosmo was 10 times better than this place."}
{"text":"Came here last weekend for lunch. It was a long line up to dine here, but it actually moves pretty quickly.   I had the American burger and truffle fries. The burger doesn't come with fries, so if you want carbs, the truffle fries are a must. They are truly delicious. The American burger basically comes with cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onions. Sounds simple, but when it's all put together with the beef patty, it is so damn good. One of the best burgers I have had for a very long time.  Service was pretty good and it doesn't really break your wallet like other places in Vegas. Only downside is that the seats are very low. Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"this place is pretty cool! my burger wasnt the best ever...but my onion rings were AWESOME. i also had the wings and jalepeno poppers(went with a group of 4-didnt eat all that by myself lol) and those were awesome too. the jalepeno poppers were huge and come with a tasty dipping sauce and the wings had a great sauce on them. needless to say we all left stuffed. i tried some of the oreo milkshake and it was good but not worth the $8 or however much it was . this place is def worth trying if youre in the mood for a burger but it is slightly expensive"}
{"text":"This was definitely worth the 1 hour wait, my wife and I went for dinner on a sunday night, once you sit down it was smooth sailings from there... I had the blue cheese burger and it was to die for, we shared the parmesan truffle fries and were those. The technology in the restaurant is cool as well, the incorporate the use of ipads and ipods... If there is a wait they take down your phone number and text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"super busy saturday night, so possibly bad service and long waits for the food.  didnt happen. was told it was a 1hr wait.  they called us back in 45. our server was very attentive. her name was Lauren. Very knowledgeable of the food,friendly and checked on us wit drinks/ and how the food was. cant stress on how great the service was.   the food.  plain and simple.  this is the real deal.  came here with friends.  we shared the maui onion rings and jalapeno popprers. out of this world.  crispy, spicy, cooked to perfection.  great sauce to go with.  ordered sweet potato fries with truffle fries to go with our burgers. fries were also good, they werent soggy like other reviews had stated, alot of reggiano on fries great flavor. had great dipping sauce with sweet potato fries.   i ordered the farm burger. mouth watering good.  had it medium. bread was soft and fresh.  came with duck breast bacon, egg, and english sharp cheddar. forget best about burger this is possibly one of the best things Ive had...period. For the price,  it was well worth it, as the food and service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Best burger on the strip. Gordon Ramsey really knows how to cook his burger. The atmosphere is great, the staff is wonderful and the food is perfect."}
{"text":"This place has received a lot of good reviews so maybe my experience was just a fluke. I came here for dinner on a Friday night to get a quick fuel up before an evening of Las Vegas festivities. There was a bit of a wait which is totally understandable on a Friday night. We were actually seated really quickly. The ambiance of this restaurant is really nice and it is very well decorated. Our waiter was prompt and attentive throughout our entire meal. The selection of craft beers was very good.  I ordered jalapeno poppers for an appetizer and the uber cheese burger for dinner. The poppers were good. The outside was well fried and crisp. The dipping sauce they were served with was an excellent compliment.   Unfortunately my meal went downhill after our appetizer. I ordered the uber cheese burger and when it came out it was clear it had been left to sit under a heat lamp or just on the counter as it was warm but certainly not hot or fresh off the grill. Additionally, the cheese on top of the burger was not even melted. I also ordered two different sides of fries the sweet potato fries and regular fries. Again, both were just warm certainly not freshly prepared. The dipping sauces for both were very good though.  I have certainly had a better burger and eaten at better restaurants in Las Vegas for the same price. I will certainly not be coming back. I was very disappointed and I expected better out of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Gordon Ramsey Burger Restaurant at Planet Hollywood.  The first time everything was perfect including the order coming out as ordered.  This time was a total disappointment.  I am on a low sodium diet and always order everything unsalted or no additional salt added to my meals.  I ordered onion rings which came out soggy not crispy and a lot of salt in the batter.  I ordered unsalted fries and the first two were good the rest were salted and the waitress could even see the salt crystals on the fries.  My burger was done perfectly and juicy.  However, the condiments were placed on the hot burger and when it arrived the lettuce was drooping off the side.  The tomatoes were warm and mushy.  Such a big plate and the condiments were on the burger instead of a garnish.  My daughter does not like pickles and they also were on the burger and totally warm due to the hot burger.  Burgers there are not cheap and the total meal was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner last weekend and was curious how it was going to be.  Ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger with Parmesan Truffle Fries.  The burger was very flavorful and could stand-up on it's own.  My burger also had Asadero cheese, roasted tomatoes and roasted jalapeno's.  I thought it could have been a bit spicier.  The fries were hand cut and really good.  The Truffle aioli dip and housemade ketchup were a nice touch.  Also enjoyed the Sticky Toffee Pudding pops with peanut ice cream.  Brought back very fond memories of eating ice cream pops, just that these were a lot fancier.  I want to come back to try some of the other items on the menu.    Service was very good."}
{"text":"Review 29 for 2017!   I really enjoy coming here because it's quality food for a reasonable price! It's also conveniently located inside of Planet Hollywood so the Miracle Mile Shops and gambling area are just a hop and a skip away. If you're coming on the weekend, make sure to arrive early! There's always a line, but check to see if you can sit at the bar to skip the wait.   Their SHAKES blow everyone else's out of the water!!! I'm not sure what it is about them, but they're super tasty. I recommend sharing it with someone since the portion is on the bigger side. My favorite is shake #4! Creme brûlée pudding and Oreo shake. I just really like the creme brûlée pudding part. I don't think I've seen the flavor offered at any other restaurant. I also ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger on the last visit and didn't regret it at all. They really don't skimp out on any of the ingredients. I also really liked the ketchup that came with our truffle Parmesan fries!   Service was great. Our server checked up on us frequently so no complaints there.   Overall verdict: I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan so I made a trip to Vegas in order to have one of his gourmet burgers. I will break this down into pros and cons so that it's easier to read through.   Pros: Decent burger. I wouldn't say it was knock your socks off wow, but it was okay. Didn't really like the sweet pickles on the burger but the meat itself was tender and juicy and well seasoned. Fries were pretty good as well.   Our waiter was extremely nice to us and did a great job of taking care of us. I commend him on a job well done in spite of what I'm about to post about this restaurant.   Cons: Female hostess in front seated others ahead of us for some unknown reason. We were standing there in front of the line and the people behind us got seated, then another couple got seated. There was only two of us and I didn't understand their method.  I finally asked \"Is there a particular reason why everyone else is being seated ahead of us.\" The ditzy girl up front asks, \"Are you waiting to be seated?\" No. I'm just standing in line for my health. Advised the manager or maitre d (not sure what he is) that others had been seated ahead of us and he waived us through without even acknowledging us. Like we were bothering him.   We were then seated at the worst table possible and we asked if we could possibly be reseated in a booth or somewhere in a more comfortable spot (we got the spot right in front of the kitchen door). There were plenty of empty seats and booths. The manager/maitr d came up and simply said, \"no.\" Sat there for 20 minutes and nobody was seated in the empty booths or more comfortable tables around us.   There was no apology or attempt to be a human, just \"no.\" I was very annoyed with him and his smug attitude. For me, service is everything. Even if the food isn't what I think it should be, I expect to be treated with a certain level of niceness, respect, whatever you want to call it. I could understand if they were busy and needed to preserve open tables but who goes to Vegas to be treated like second class? You go to Vegas to feel good, for an escape.  Every single person in Vegas was nice to me, went out of their way to accomodate and please, except for that manager/maitre d. I wish Gordon would put a hidden camera in there to see how horrible he is.   The way I was made to feel was that he was doing me a favor simply by letting me in that restaurant.   The burger was good and that's the only reason for my 2 star rating. If you are looking for proper service, I highly recommend another place - any other place on the strip where people know how to treat others."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The server was great! Service in general, just ok. The burgers had the potential to be great had the chef not served them to me RAW not once but 3 1/2 times. I ordered 2 burgers for myself and one for my girl. They were all ordered medium/well. 2 came out rare and one was RAW! By this time we had waited in line for 25 mins and waited at the end of the bar where we watched everyone else's food come out for another 30 mins or more. Mouth watering and hungry we decided to eat the rare ones sending the raw one back. The refired one came back rare again more raw on one half then the other. As for the flavor, they were all very good. I would go back, but if they messed up again, I wouldn't return.   Server: awesome! Service in general: not great.  Food: great flavor and recipes, undercooked! Decor: cool place. Seating: NEVER sit at end of bar. It's torture watching all the food leaving the kitchen waiting on your own.  If the chef cooked the burgers correctly, I would have given my experience a solid 4. I would still recommend to try this place.   We also ate at GR Steak. That was one of the top 5 dining experiences I've had. Except for we ordered the Wellington and they never brought out the sauce. Didn't realize until watching Hells Kitchen later on. :( But the bread, Kobe Filet & Mac & cheese were great."}
{"text":"I visited here twice and i really enjoyed both times that I was there. I had Hell's kitchen burger and the meat was juicy and flavorful. I personally like spicy flavor therefore it was a perfect choice for myself but I can understand how some people will find it too strong of spiciness. I also had a Banana milkshake and it was mediocre, just like any other milkshakes. The price range was relatively lower than I expected. There was a long waiting line but overall, I had a pleasant experience and will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came on on my last day of my Vegas visit, because my friends wanted to try it out.  The long was pretty long getting in, but we had the choice of giving the hostess our number to be on the waiting list. She said the approximate wait for us was about an hour and a half. We waited close to 2 hours and 15 minutes.  Upon seating, it took us about 10 minutes to decide what we wanted to order. Our party consisted of 8 people. We each ordered a burger and a total of 3 different styles of fries.  It took a almost an hour for our food to come out, the wait was quite disappointing. For the whole hour of waiting all we had in front of us were drinks. Not even our fries came out yet. After 45 minutes, we asked them to check on our food. Sadly my friend said it in a not so well manner, as we were all in a bad mood. \"Umm, excuse me. Wheres are food? we've been waiting for a long time and even the our appetizers didn't come out yet.\" The Waitress responded. \"Oh, wheres your food? uh... they're making it?\" She said this with a nice friendly smile, as if were just messing around, but I can assure you we were really irritated.  After another 15 minutes had passed, Our food finally came out. All 8 Burgers. Another 5 minutes, 2 fries came out, and another 5 after, the last order of fries.  The food was great. At first I was thinking, 16 dollars for just a burger and it doesn't come with sides? Better be bomb.  The burger was good, but I expected way more, considering the preparation took a good hour. The size of the burger wasn't out of the ordinary. Looked average compared to any other Burger joints. We had gratuity but we tipped a little more, not because the service was great or anything, but because some of us were and are servers ourselves, so we tip generously. If I don't know the struggles of a waiter, I'd probably just tip 15% for this experience.  All in all, I was quite disappointed with this place, I probably will not be visiting again. I'd much rather go to \"The Counter\" or any other restaurant who's specialty is in burgers. The Food quality seems the same to me, (The Counter may be bigger in size depending on what you order, but the tastes is hardly a difference) but the prep time for food is much more reasonable then this place.  At least on the day I visited. [Sunday Afternoon: 1:15p-4:00p ish]"}
{"text":"The food was great. But what impressed me the most is the work ethic of this restaurant. It was a joy to see all the staff in the open kitchen prepare the food so efficiently and cleanly. We are blown away by how our server Justin clean the tables. It's like a show of its own. It's worth the wait to dine here!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, drinks and service. Exceeded my expectations. Jalapeño shooters and onion rings were my favorite. The chicken burger was soooo good. Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Im actually giving it one more star than i intentioned cuz the burgers were good. The customer service is a no no. Ive always passed by it while i was here and really wanted to try it, and my husband never likes to wait for this kind of stuff but he easily said okay since i really wanted to try.  Hellz kitchen burgr and the sweet potato fries were good. I think we could've gotten the fries while we were waiting for the food to arrive... 35 mins for a burger? I understand that it was christmas but its always packed there. We waited in line for about 45 mins and food 40 mins... I even had to ask after 30mins if we could get our fries first but he just snapped \"its christmas, its busy, so you need to wait and ill check on your order\" and gave me they eye roll and left. He was literally on hands and feet to the table right next to us... And I dont mean to bring out the racist card.. He's caucasian, table next to us the same.., we are asian. Wtf. Well thats ok, i just wont be going back for a second time, had my experience and now im done! :)"}
{"text":"Ok, I get giddy just thinking about the food I had here.   When having \"the best burger you've ever had in your entire life\" you reach a point of taste bud nirvana you dream about for days to come. Sound familiar? So take that experience and now multiply it by 3. That was my experience here.   Gordon Ramsay is crazy on Hell's Kitchen, but if that translates to crazy good food I'm all for it. Every single item on the burger is art. The bun itself is a taste experience. The burger meat is high quality perfection. We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries with aioli sauce and housemade ketchup on the side. Again, MIND-BLOWING.   Finally we had the last item which put us in a food coma we didn't get out of until the next day. Shake #5: chocolate and hazelnut pudding, coffee shake, and topped with a praline cookie  Best burger, fries, and milkshake I ever had in my life. Document it."}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! One of the best burger I've ever had. I had the Britannia with arugula and mango chutney and it was delicious. The fries but the burger was the main attraction. I took the top bun off which made really brought out the flavor!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Must try Hell Kitchen Burger and fries!  Gregg is the best server! Really great customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Just want to say the burgers are amazing.....there is no like it! My favorite is the Euro Burger, it's a must try...with the Sweet potato French fries that are powdered and you can dip in sweet jalapeno sauce... My mouth waters talking about it!!!! Yummy!!! Every single Vegas trip, we always eat there!!!"}
{"text":"Tanta qualità.  Mangiare uno di questi hamburger è come mangiare una bistecca. Vera carne, spessa e cotta davvero bene.   Locale carino ma niente di speciale."}
{"text":"Burgers isn't my favorite food but this place sure makes me doubt that. They have great delicious burgers that aren't too greasy! I always get the burger with avocado and their truffle fries! They also have shakes and they are a MUST try!! The oreo creme brûlée is my absolute favorite!  Its not your ordinary milk shake! The lines here tend to get long but if ur a diamond card you get to cut the long line and usually will be seated within 10 mins. They have an open kitchen which is cool to see how the cooking process is done. The staff is overall friendly and fast! Prices are a little high for burgers but then again it is vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I've never considered myself much of a burger person, until now. This burger was perfection! A simple cheese with lettuce and it was spectacular. As were the fries and the environment.   The only reason four the four star review is that our service was about as bad as it gets. Our server was really out of it. Tables with other servers sat after us and ordered before us. Others sat after us, ordered after us, and finished their meals before we were served. The issue appeared to be limited to our area/server.   All of that said I would go back. No question. The standard of the food is on another level."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my wife and was very pleased. My burger was delicious and actually made the way i like it, \"medium\". Servers were all nice and enjoyed our time there."}
{"text":"We ate here twice in our recent visit to Caesars Palace. The fish and chips were the best I have eaten. We also had our first lamb burger. It was delicious! The staff were very attentive and the Manager Randy made sure our visits were memorable. Chef Scott is doing a fantastic job. You did it right Gordon! Thank you all so much. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The long wait is acceptable.   The hostesses were stuck up and held their head a little too high when they walked passed you like you were something else. Water ran out fast and was refilled once the meal was completely over to the point the ice was melted and the glass was literally empty. Truffle fries looked good but tasted extremely salty.   The waiter, Michael was rude. The kitchen didn't put cheese on my friend's burger and he asked for it. The waiter came back 20 mins later when everyone else was almost done eating (my friend would not eat the burger without the cheese) and brought out a plate of what looked like two pieces of Kraft cheese, not melted or anything. Just like that. Normally, a waiter would at least AT LEAST take the burger back and melt some cheese, takes like what, 2 mins? 5 mins max.   Then the bill came. We had a party of about ten, separate bills. Charged EACH of us gratuity. My bf and I ate two burgers $30, shake $10, onion rings (VERY GOOD) $11, truffle fries, $11 and the rest was tax and gratuity (The bill was $84) I'm sorry what! Yeah, I wouldn't mind giving $12 tip if you could give me some water. Unacceptable and it's not even worth giving a second try.  *PS. The other waitresses can't even remember the order. Twice the order was brought out. One to the wrong table. And one, the girl brought it out and then brought it to another table and brought it back when she finally remembered the name of the dish she was carrying.."}
{"text":"Top to bottom this place is a burger lovers paradise.  It's the embodiment of upscale burgers with the flavor , taste , and decor to warrant the price.   It's not cheap so bring your big boy wallet as well as your appetite.   GOOD 1:  amazing food.  Everything here is delicious  GOOD 2:  the wait staff are the masters of their craft.  From the initial greeting to the menu explanation they know how to make the experience top notch.   GOOD 3:  consistency.  It's all about being able to come back and have the same great taste and experience every time.   This place doesn't fail.   BAD 1:  the price.  It's not a bad thing but it's worth the cautionary.   This isn't Fat Burger, Dennnys, or your local burger shack.   This is the Morton's of burgers.   It's worth the cost but it's not cheap.   Overall,  this place rocks and it satisfies every bit of my expectations from world famous chef Gordon Ramsay.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Ramsay Burgr!  There was a bit of a line, but it moved quickly and, though we were told there would be a 15-minute wait, it only took about five minutes for us to get a table.  The Hell's Kitchen burger is excellent, and has a great level of spice!  Ask for burgers that are off-the-menu as well; my husband and in-laws got the Gordon burger at the waitress' recommendation and it was a hit.  Order the truffle fries as well; one side of fries is plenty for two people and they're served a la carte.  The service was good and the waitress was very friendly.  My only complaint is that I ordered my burger medium-well, and it came back more pink then my in-laws', who ordered theirs medium.  But, overall, the experience was great, and the buns were to die for!"}
{"text":"Very good burgr. I had The Hells kitchen burgr which tasted Amazing. It Would have Been better if it was a little more warm Though. As a side we Shared The trufle parmesan fries, so good"}
{"text":"Slap a famous man's name behind a business and they all come running. Put it in Vegas and it's destined to be a goldmine. To me, burger's scream 'comfort food' and as such they should be filling, packed with flavour and have a very amazing bun to compliment the meat and fixings.   I went here last year in hopes that the hype would resonate through the food. Al I have to say is - \"ya, it was good\". What I wanted to say was \"this was the most amazing burger I've ever eaten\" so I'm a bit disappointed. I was also expecting a great experience to compliment the eats but that fell short.   I expected a bit of a wait since this restaurant was in Vegas and it was prime time for dinner rush. The decor and ambience of the place was cool and the service was great. The drinks were great and the prices were manageable. But the burgers were alright.   I was expecting a flavour experience and really all I got was a burger that was as comparable to a local burger bar in Edmonton called Delux.   Would I go back? Probably not. I will opt for other dining experiences that focus on different cuisine."}
{"text":"We don't know what happened with all the amazing staff from last year. These people do not have any personalities to be servers. You can not come to a table ,  being grumpy and not even ask what do you want to drink but rather staying like a statue and waiting for your guest to start talking. We saw her twice - once when she took the order and once when we got the check. The only person that had the personality and the looks to be a server was the busser - Sheena. She was absolutely amazing and deserves to be on the floor and do the job that her colleagues clearly don't enjoy. Why do you keep a valuable player in the back of the restaurant instead of letting her shine and making customers happy. This screams poor management all the way in!  P.s otherwise food is absolutely amazing, I never miss to eat here at least twice every time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here! The burgers, fries, and oreo/creme brulee shake were all delicious. A great option for dinner on the strip that is on the more casual side."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends birthday.  Their food was to die for! The Hell's kitchen burger is quite possibly the best burger I have ever eaten and I love my burgers.  Shake #4 Creme brulee/oreo shake was heavenly.  Honestly the service was almost as amazing as the food.  All around great experience.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Decided to try Burgr because I love watching Gordon Ramsey on tv and he was promoting this place on masterchef. Also, heard great things about this restaurant through friends and family. I came here with high hopes that I would have a orgasm in my mouth, I even talked my mom into coming with me (she doesn't like burgers because she says it's fattening). I told her it had great reviews and she would like it. WRONG!!   I ordered the jalapeño poppers and the jells kitchen burger. My fiancé, the American burger? I forgot the name. And my mom, the hog burger and we all shared fries.  Jalapeño poppers were the only good thing we ordered. The sauce was delicious.   American burger: in&out will always be the best. It was so dry and bland. Asked for medium well got well done.   Hell's kitchen: it was alright, it only tasted good because I put ketchup in it. Dry and asked for medium well also and got super well done.  The hog burger: mediocre at best. My mom said mcdonalds Big Mac was even better.  Fries: they were just fries. The sauces were tasty, but def nothing special.  I forgot to mention, we waited 40 mins for our burgers! The reason why we didn't send our burgers back, we didn't wanna wait another 40 for them to get it right when it should've been the first time.   Never coming back, at least we got to experience this place. Next on the list, Bachi Burger!"}
{"text":"Features: -We tried the roasted jalapeno poppers which came with cheddar bacon, cheddar ranch, and a \"fiery surprise\" and boy, was this super delicious!  It was so cheesy and I love cheese so this really hit the spot.  This came with six poppers so we all had one and I had an extra one since I liked it so much. -The truffles fries were raged about but I did not like it as much.  It was hand cut fries with truffle parmesan, truffle salt, and truffle aioli.  We all thought the fries were going to be sliced really thin but it was really thick and the parmesan and truffle salt was just okay.  The aioli sauce was good, it definitely enhanced the taste of the fries. -The Hell's Kitchen Burger had asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and over roasted tomato.  It was delicious, a lot better than many of the burgers I have tasted.  The avocado and tomato was really fresh and the cheese really made the burger taste well.  Improvements: -We waited so long for a table.  We were promised 45 minutes but we ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes. -Truffle fries were okay, I would suggest to cut the fries to thinner slices and adding something to make it stand out.  Tips: -Come early and put your name down, they will text you when your table is ready.   -Make sure you try the roasted jalapeno poppers, they were worth $12!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this burger joint but the food was just meh. We ordered the honey-pig bao buns and it seemed like we were just eating the bun! An order comes with two buns and the meat to bun ration was like 1:5 ! The smallest piece of meat ever with cucumber, radish, and cilantro that did not go well together at all. Yuck. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger that came with roasted jalepeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomatoes which all sound like it would be a heavenly burger, right? Wrong! It didn't taste like 1 whole burger, but rather just eating parts of it together. The boyfriend got the chili dog which had roasted fresno peppers, jalapeno, cheese, avocado, onion, and chipotle ketchup. All sounds like amazing ingredients!! But the taste.. it did not marry well together at all. So disappointing. The truffle parmesan fries were the only thing that saved this meal."}
{"text":"One word! Disaponting we were super excited about coming to this place, after all one is Chef's Ramsay's restaurants and as fans of his Master Chef show we were expecting to taste some of the greatness. We order the Hell burger and well is just a burguer nothing special my husband order the burguer meat well done and they gave him rare, we also ordered the just fries and they were super salty I could barely eat them, the best we got was the chipotle ketchup that comes with the fries!!   The Hostess at the front had the most serious face I mean I know you are tired from work but this is Vegas and also you are representing a world known Chef. Not the super costumer we were expecting.   Bottom line NO I don't recommend and will not go back, it was just a waist of money and time for us!!"}
{"text":"It was 3 star for food but great service bumped it up to 4 star! We ordered many different types of food  to try on. The shakes are AMAZING and unique! The 2 shakes that we ordered were: Coconut pudding and strawberry shake, Butterscotch pudding and banana shake. The shakes have a floating pudding on top, creating a different balance of color, texture and taste! Our Truffle parmesan fries came cold and too salty, so we sent it back for a more hot and less salt, and it was perfect. For burgers we had Hell's Kitchen burger (a bit spicy, perfect!), Uber cheese burger (the trio cheese has a unique flavor), and Farm burger, that had egg, oozing out. My favorite was the Hell's burger. We ordered Pork belly Dawg, which was a New York dog (super salty, beware!), with bits of cha siu that was overpowered by the saltiness of the dog, but the bun was a killer. My favorite small dish was Roasted jalapeño poppers that was filled with cheddar cheese, cream cheese and bacon bits,  presented in 6 small shooter glass. Not only it was visually appealing, it also had a bold kick in taste factor! Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream  was memorable too. I loved the way they put it in a clear pop sickle case that you have to push up to eat it. I know they are just opened a few days ago and there were still things to improve. I will definitely give them a chance again in the future.  I had a nice talk with the friendly manager, Emily, and she was listening and was writing down notes. I liked the fact that they are open minded, and willing to take suggestion to improve. The best part was the SERVICE! They explained the menu and food with passion, very knowledgeable, and very open minded for improvement! Manager Emily ROCKS!!"}
{"text":"The burger was amazing, best one I have ever had. Milkshakes are also creative and extremely tasty. Wait time is roughly 25 mins between ordering and the food coming. Definitively worth it."}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience. I had the Gordon Ramsay burger $19 and my husband had the Hog burger $18. We also tried the truffle parm fries $11. Since the waitress told us the burger wait time would be 30+ minutes, we ordered the chicken sliders app $13. The chicken sliders and burgers were very delicious but the truffle parm fries were just ok. We will def return since there were so many other tasty sounding choices. The menu is a take home souvenir. Total damage with 2 beers & an ice tea was $79!"}
{"text":"Finally had time to do a review on this place!! Let's talk about location, it was inside Planet Hollywood's casino floor right along the strip. Decor and ambience was really nice. The whole place seemed a lot like what we watched on television of Hell's Kitchen. The sign, \"BURGR GORDON RAMSEY,\" was made of glass with the inside lit with real fire. It was a sight to see!   My bf and I decided to eat here on the second day we arrived in Vegas which was smacked on a Friday. Everywhere was packed with people going to eat, shopping and nightclubs. The restaurant was a full house but the wait wasn't long. There were two options for the waiting: one was to put your name on an iPad and put down how big or small is your party and they will call you when the table is ready or you can wait in the line which wasn't bad because we waited for about 15 minutes and we got seated.   Upon being seated and looking at the menu (which is quite small and gets to the point of what burger was most recommended, it was really easy to choose). My bf got the Hell's Kitchen Burger while I got the Farm Burger. We also got the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Fries do not come with the burgers. Waiting for the food took roughly 30-45 minutes but my bf said it was worth it and he never says anything is worth it until this place. He devoured his burger and ate almost all the fries and said it was great. He loved this place and would want to visit again. I thought my burger can do a little veggie in it but regardless it's a great burger for meat lovers."}
{"text":"Saw all the positive reviews and felt that we had to pay this place a visit. The place looks nice and created high expectations. First negative was the wait time...on a Monday! We ordered the European, a Hell's Kitchen, fries and a no.5 shake. The shake was absolutely delicious! Then came the rest of our order. The fries were salty...I mean SALTY! Too much and we only ate a few. The burgers were ok, not as special as we had expected. If this would have been it then I would probably have ended this review with 3 stars. Two hours later though the wifey had to throw up to get the burger out of her system after having been noxious for some time. Not a good experience at Ramsay's."}
{"text":"I ordered the Gordon Burger, and it was the best dang burger I've ever eaten in my entire life! No other Burger will ever compare to this one. The french fries were also truly amazing! We were a little skeptical about the prices, but after having tasted the food, I can now say that it was worth every penny we paid."}
{"text":"If you are a party of two, don't go there!  They make a party of two wait in the line.   While we were waiting in the line, hostess removed larger parties who came after us  (7, 6, 14) and all of them got seated before us.  We waited 45 minutes.  A party of 6 came after 20 minutes or so but got seated 10 minutes before us.  Does this make sense to you?    Burgers were good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Lines kinda ridiculous here so if I were you you should go really early. I remember the wait for us is three hours!! Crazy. So we decided to go the next day instead and really early. Even though we were there early we still had to wait for an hour since we had a large group.   The place itself is nice but it's super cold. I was cold most of the time and I couldn't really enjoy my food so I had to ask the server to lower down the ac. Other Han that it's not bad of a place to eat burger. The atmospher is very friendly and typical burger place.   I order the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was super gooood! I didn't expect it to be that spicy but over all it was good. I was a bit disappointed with the presentation of the burger I mean it looked plain. But I guess it's just a burger. My friend ordered the truffle fries and it was sooooo good with the sauce on the side!    Love this place!"}
{"text":"Nothing here is simple or plain, even if they claim it is. Everything is a work of art and so incredibly flavorful and creatively made. The chicken slider appetizer will leave you dieing for more!! Their burgers are all delicious as are the shakes with PUDDING on the top!! Yes, you read me correctly. Delicious milkshake. Pudding. Yess!!!! There may be a line but it moves pretty decently. And it is well worth your time. Service has always been good and the atmosphere is comfortable albeit a bit crowded feeling at the tables.  But try it!!"}
{"text":"After 5-10min wait i got seated at the single line seats facing the kitchen. Just fine.  and then i just waited and waited and waited..  More than one time i tried to contact the staff but was told that they would have \"my waiter\" come...  I waited some more and after 15 mins of being completely IGNORED i choose to LEAVE the place again. Maybe this place was good food, but i do not like being ignored. If the place is too busy and you cant handle the load, stop taking in more guests....."}
{"text":"One of my first stops when I got to Vegas was Gordon Ramsay Burgr and I was impressed. The line wasn't too horrible around lunch time and wait time was only 10-15 minutes to get inside. Once inside the restaurant was very large inside and had a lot of seating. I got the opportunity to sit in front of the kitchen and watch how things are run. Service was excellent, the lady was very helpful and friendly on my first visit there. As for the food and size of the portions I'm very happy. I had an off the menu burger properly named the Gordon Ramsay burger, along with the parmesan truffle fries. The price for the burger was 18 dollars and the price for the fries was 11 dollars. The burger was absolutely fantastic to the palate. In addition the truffle fries came with a truffle aïoli which was also very good. Although this may seem very costly I thought the quality of food and the portions was very fitting. The atmosphere of the restaurant was also very nice. If you're ever in Vegas and want to grab a burger for lunch or dinner Gordon Ramsay Burgr is a place to consider."}
{"text":"Definitely not cheap.  But Vegas.  Got the \"Hell's Kitchen\" burger and it was VERY good.  The wife liked her burger too but she's very plain.  All in all, I'd recommend it...if you've got the money.  Cuz Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped here because we didn't require a reservation. Good atmosphere with an open kitchen and comfortable seating arrangement. The amount of televisions seem overdone.   Selection of burgers was as advertised but the wait time for said burgers was at ATROCIOUS. After sitting for approximately 50 minutes we received our dinner, however the server did reach out to us and apologized for the long wait.   They did have house made ketchup and other dips for their fries which was a refreshing change from the norm.   This restaurant could be helped with some thoughtful burger and beer pairing options/suggestions from the menu or staff."}
{"text":"Don't want to say too much food was good but not so wow for the price, service is ok the big problem is the waiting time to get in"}
{"text":"My husband and I split a farm burger and sweet potato fries and were completely full! The burger was delicious and the fries were really good as well! We even got to see Hell's Kitchen winner, Christina who is the head chef there now! It was very exciting since we are big fans of Ramsey and his shows!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Burgr. Came in to eat on my own and the staff made me feel at home and were very attentive. The food was excellent. I recommend getting the truffle fries, best fries on the strip."}
{"text":"Major disappointment. Either Gordon Ramsay's shows are a fake ass front or he needs to get over here to BurGR and get things in order the way he makes it appear on tv. Having eaten at his pub and grill before and having a great experience I didn't think BurGR was going to be the way it ended up. The wait was 2 hours to get a table and once inside it took forever to even get our order taken. The jalapeño poppers we stared out with were terrible and I've had better at. sonic. The inside was still cold. Unfortunately cold food seemed to be the theme of the night. Our fries and onion rings were brought out cold. My burger was cold and flavorless while the hot dog I had was just ridiculously too big for the bun it was on. Our server and many inexcusable reasons why he didn't get our food to us sooner. When you first walk into this place they have flames shooting all over so where the heck was the hot food and flavor? I really hoped for a better burger at this place."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are delicious. Jalapeño poppers were a joke...we were \"warned\" that one (just one :\) would be really spicy. Needless to say, that didn't happen. Another side item/app also disappointed, so much so I  can't even recall what is was now! Worst part about the experience...boyfriend left his Gucci sunglasses behind and someone had a 'finders keepers' moment."}
{"text":"I ordered the Farm Burger and I am certain I will never find another burger that delicious anywhere else as long as I live. Thanks for ruining all the rest of the burgers that will enter my life Ramsey!!!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I spent $15 on this burger. I probably should have known better, having eaten at Gordon Ramsay Steak. Over rated burgers. Definitely not he best I have eaten.   I ordered this to go and the burgers don't even include any fries or sides. The ladies at the front desk were nice. I wouldn't come here again. Burgers are way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Pricey and the burgers were not good. I had the blue cheese burger. It tasted only of blue cheese.  My sister had the regular cheese burger and it was so sweet she couldn't eat it. For the price it has horrible. Will never go there again."}
{"text":"\"This beef is so undercooked that it is trying to eat the salad\" - Gordon Ramsay  Well you shouldn't have this problem at Gordon Ramsay BurGR as you can get your burger cooked to your liking (medium well for me).  There are no advance reservations that can be made at BurGR, but that's ok because the wait really isn't that bad.  Anywho let's break this place down yo!?!  ~~~Wait for a table~~~ Normal days wait can be anywhere from 10-20mins, Fridays and weekends you might spend anywhere from 30-45mins.  You can always call ahead of time and ask how long the line queue is.    Quick Tip: Grab a drink from the bar while you wait in line and you can even bring it in with you, cuz when you're in Vegas it's a must to #GetCrunk   ~~Restaurant Ambiance~~~ They got a great layout, I mean the chairs & tables to the decor are all really something!  They have a bar area and even TVs all around the restaurant so you can catch the game.  We came here around March Madness and it was really really loud and of course you had crunk people at the bar as well.  Also I was in love with the Interactive Touch Screen Menu, more restaurants should have this!?!  ~~~Food~~~ Hell's Kitchen Burger - this is a staple and their most ordered burger, the old lady didn't like it but I think it was because she asked for it well done and it dried out the flavor.  Chanterelle Burger - got this medium well, loaded with mushrooms and drenched with some onion jam.  I was in burger heaven, the most flavorful patty I have ever tasted and the burger buns were good too!?!  Truffle Fries - come with two dipping sauces which are really good, but the fries themselves were \"meh\"  ~~~Service~~~ Ahhhh-mazing, wouldn't expect anything less from a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant!?!  ~~~Improvements~~~ 1. Gotta improve them fries. 2. Make a \"Big Option\" for the Burger, it's a very small serving. 3. Make your burger option, where you can pick all the yummy add-ins yourself because I wanted a few items from other burgers to be added to my burger."}
{"text":"While staying at the Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, due to convenience we ended up dining at Gordan Ramsey Burger 2- 3 times I believe (Lil blurry lol). Also the hotel gave us $25 restaurant credit to use daily.   The 1st time was just to grab an appetizer and a drink. Boy or Boy the drinks freaking Expensive!!! My Cosmo was like $10 bucks and my Hubby's Jameson straight was just plain ridiculous.  The jalapeno poppers we ordered were amazing!  Not for a vegetarian though, there was bacon in the sauce.  The poppers come out piping out, in shot glasses with ranch bacon sauce on the bottom.  The bartender said he believed those were the best item in the restaurant, and I would have to agree.  Hubby ordered the Earth Burger aka a portabella mushroom burger which was comes al carte and lacked in flavor.  The next time we went, the line was crazy!  But since we did not want to pay the price for their drinks it was ok.  We sat in the lounge, listening to music and watched a drunken man try to be a part of the band playing.  After an hour wait, we were finally buzzed.  This time we had burgers and I got a soba noodle salad.  The American burger was bland but I guess that is what you get for ordering one of the less adventurous burgers on the menu.  The soba noodle salad was not good, not good at all.  It had all the great fresh components but the dressing was full of black pepper and no other flavors.  So no Thanks!  Overall, Meh!  The lines, the food, and the expensive a$$ drinks equaled no thanks.  But the cute server outfits and the jalapenos equaled . . . maybe? Doubt we will be back on our never Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Omg worth every penny! Get the onion rings. We ate until our stomachs said no more. Staff was friendly and gave us a complimentary dessert for our birthday. Only negative was I wanted a t-shirt souvenir and they were out."}
{"text":"This restaurant flavor was great..bit pricey but worth it.! Was there with some of the Ms. Universe contestants..  The food was delicious!"}
{"text":"We had the Hell's Kitchen burger, the jalapeño poppers, and the American burger. They were all amazing, and the menu was reasonably priced. The service was, overall, average, but the beer menu made up for the underwhelming service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I decided to go try BurGR based on what my friends wanted to eat.   We started off waiting in line for about 10 minutes before someone came up and let us make a \"reservation\" so we could roam around Planet Hollywood. She told us 45 minutes and it took just about that long. Once we arrived, we were seated within five minutes.   Our waiter came and we decided to try out Jalapeño Poppers. They were amazing! Especially the one with the seeds! Nice and spicy. 5/5.  Next we ordered our food. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger, some regular fries, and shake #4 which was a mixture of an oreo shake, creme brulee and an oreo cookie.   Burger: It was okay. I expected way more and I've tasted much better burgers. Shake wasn't too bad either. But being the person that I am, I expected better from Gordon Ramsay. I was not impressed, I felt like the guy in the chicken nuggets meme and I wanted to go into the kitchen and yell at someone so they would actually make a good burger.   3/5, maybe next time Gordon."}
{"text":"Good beer and good burgers.  What else do I need to say?  But really though, my burger was tasty and cooked to a perfect MR.  Service was great and attentive.  The only negative things I have to say about it is that the line was hella long to get a table. Everyone sees the name, Gordon Ramsay, and they start getting starry eyed.   The restaurant is cool and all, but I think it's a little gimmicky. Yeah, it has Chef's name on it, but he's not cooking your burger for you, calm down."}
{"text":"As expected, one of the best burgers I've ever had.  I tried the Farm Burger, and also had a variety of French fries and sauces.  It was a bit disorganized when it came to drink services.  I was brought two drinks and told they were not what I ordered, but each time they were what I ordered, so I'm not sure what that was about..."}
{"text":"Great food. I have eaten here a few times and the food has been delicious. The burgers are nice and juicy with good flavor. I've orders there hotdog as well and it was really good. The truffle fries are good. The onion rings are the best I ever had. The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is that that jalapeño poppers have pork in them. It's tooooo bad cuz they look really good. Staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times and they haven't failed me yet lol.  I am not even a big fan of burger but even then I like this place a lot. They are always so honest with their ingredients and portion, Every components tastes on point in the burger and they are actually all decently priced. The patty is especially well cooked. Don't be fooled by Gordon Ramsay's big name, foods aren't too expansive there. The shake is big portioned and creamy!  Last week I was there I got a standard dawg but the size is definitely beyond standard. It was huge The waitresses and waiters are very welcoming and fast in serving you. They are also very energetic to let you know what's good on the menu. Very nice! I would visit again if I have no better choice again in Vegas, this is always a safe place to eat at. They won't disappoint you:)"}
{"text":"Love love love their burgers! They are the best I've had and I crave them thuroughtout the year! Every time we visit Vegas, we make a stop at Burgr.  We ordered the Farm Burger which was so perfect in balaced flavor. The meat (medium rare) and the salty duck bacon with the running egg was so good and juicy. All the buns are toasted with butter. Yum! My husband really liked the chili hot dog. It was made with actual chilis, not the chili you normally put on a hot dog. So it had a southwest flavor to it that I didn't particularly enjoy but husband loved it!  The chicken burger was scrumptious too and surprisingly juicy.  Don't forget then shakes! So good! We order them first and eat them before and during our meal.  I have refered and brought friends to this place, it's that good."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Vegas!  Fun, lively and decadent experience.  With the flames a-glow and well dressed servers and hostesses running about you get a complete Strip experience here.  You can't go wrong with any of the food, the apps, the fries and the burgers will all impress you.  There is a reason Gordon Ramsey is so well respected in the culinary world.  My advice go hungry and go with a lot of people, this will optimize the items you get to try, and you will want to try them all!  Get the truffle fries and the sweet potatoes fries, both are cooked and seasoned perfectly and are topped off with creamy ailois and honey mustard deliciousness. Skip the hot dogs, I'm sure they are good but why would you hot dog when you could burger??  As for the burgers it doesn't matter which one you get, they are all better than any other burger.  They are complex wth flavors, nuanced from tradition and yet so comforting and appealing.  Did I mention mango chutney?!  The toppings are so creative, just give into it.  Is it sweet, is is spicy, is it soft, is it crispy, yes, yes, yes, yes! It's everything you want a gourmet burger to be with a little British flare. If you can handle it order the milkshakes, although it is like a meal in itself, albeit a meal made in heaven with cream and pudding and toffee and everything the Candyland game should be made of.  Most mortals won't be able to head to dessert after all the burgers and fries, but if you have super powers and can manage you should be bestowed with some type of Burgr award! Wear it with pride as I know you will want to come back soon."}
{"text":"Basically a perfect hamburger. Definitely a little too touristy, but perhaps that's not such a bad thing on the strip. Worth the 15-20 minute wait. One thing: if you sit by that huge flame at the entrance be prepare to warm up big time.  Really one of the better burgers I've had in sin city."}
{"text":"Service - Slow, very slow.  Casual indifference of the server paired with a inefficient kitchen made for a difficult wait for those with children.  We are talking 30+ minutes from order to delivery of food.    Food -  Fries are kept under a heat lamp while the burgers come out one at a time to the expediter.  Not good.  This means majority of the guests are waiting for others to receive their food before everyone gets to enjoy.  Sure goes against everything we've seen on Hell's Kitchen or Master Chef Mr. Ramsey.  Taste wise, have to admit it everyone enjoyed their burgers.  Would I return?  I would, provided the overall experience in service improves."}
{"text":"A decent burger, but the prices are a tad high ($10 for french fries)."}
{"text":"Went here early July with my cousin. Warning: waiting in line next to live fire will cause excess perspiration haha. She got the American and I got the Hog. They were nice enough to substitute out the apple butter for aioli on the side, since I'm allergic to apple. Waiting for the food took sooooo long (about 40 minutes). I. To be fair, the place was ~85% packed. I also had shake #3.  The burgers themselves were extremely smoky. Despite the ridiculous smoke flavor, all the other flavors came through. Very satisfying, to look at and eat - they were super filling . I only finished about 2/3 of mine. That shake, though... The cookie on top was brittle, which was a bit disappointing, but it tasted fantastic - not too sweet. Praline had me moaning xD Best shake EVER  The (blonde-haired) waitress seemed more concerned about the bartender than us. Nonchalantly checked in on us once during our meal in passing. MAYBE the poor service was because I'm young - loathsome. I remember leaving about 7% tip. Looking back, should have been more like 3 or 4%, or none at all.  Ratings: Hog burger: 11.2/13 + Shake #3: 12.9/13 + Presentation: 8.4/10... Overall Food: 65/72 - Fine Dining Atmosphere: 10.7/13 - Snazzy Service: 4.0/15 - Distasteful Total: 79.7/100 - Great stuff"}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time visiting this restaurant and I always order this burger with an extra side if grilled jalapeños!!! Talk about FIRE!!! If you like heat like I do, definitely get this. We love both the onion rings and the plain fries,  you'd be pleased with either one."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Wait time was minimal, about 10 mins (would have been sooner if we ate at the bar but we wanted a table).  I had the Hells kitchen burger (without cheese).  It was delicious.  Truffle fries were really good.  Also tried the sweet potato fries, I could have done without the powdered sugar on top but they were really good too.  Waitress was great. She even brought us some Chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch to try.  I know it sounds weird but the cheddar ranch was great.  Didn't taste cheesy at all.  The burger was  too big for me to bite into so I just cut it up with my knife.  Didn't eat the whole thing because it filled me up.  My husband had no problem eating it and enjoyed it aswell.  We definitely recommend this place and we will be back."}
{"text":"BurGR is located inside of the Planet Hollywood.  If you are lost and can't find the place, just go towards the long ass line.  Trust me, the wait is worth it!  If you go with a party of 3 or more, walk right up to the desk and let the host know.  They will text you when your table is ready so you won't have to wait in line.  If you go by yourself or are a party of 2, flash your platinum Total Rewards card and up and get priority seating.  The atmosphere of the place is pretty casual and open.  The front of the place does open out into the casino so the place does get a little loud sometimes.  I think the only downside of the place is that some of the seating is not as intimate and you feel like you're just an arm length away from the next table if you're not sitting in a booth.  Also the seats for some reason are super close to the ground which is weird.  You feel like you need a booster seat.  It is definitely not a place to sit for those with hip/knee replacements and such.  There is bar seating for those who don't want to sit so close to the ground.  In addition, there is no bathroom inside the restaurant so you would have to walk out of the restaurant and use the casino's bathroom which is directly across from the restaurant.  Remember, the restaurant is inside the casino so it's not like you're having to make a long trek to the bathroom or even step outside onto the strip.  You are still inside the casino and you are literally just taking a couple steps to go to the bathroom.  It is really no biggie.  As far as the food goes, obviously this is mainly a burger joint since the name of the restaurant is BurGR after all.  There are also side snacks and dishes to order such as roasted jalapeno poppers, shakes, truffle parmesan fries, fresh roasted chili dawgs, and so much more!  I have eaten at this restaurant many times and I can honestly say that I have tried close to most of the burgers on the menu including the one that was the special for the day and I have enjoyed everything so far.  The burger that I recommend ordering is the Hell's Kitchen Burger!  After you have eaten this burger, it will probably ruin all burgers for you after that.  I wasn't a big burger fan coming to this restaurant and the Hell's Kitchen Burger did it for me.  It is a yummy burger that is made up of a patty that has three different types of ground meat, fresh roasted buns, asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato.  For those who don't enjoy spicy foods, don't worry, the jalapeno peppers are not crazy spicy.  This burger is so good and packs so much flavor that you will not need any condiments!  The burger is also very juicy and is the perfect size.  It is not too little and not too big.  You can definitely order many burgers and cut it in half and share with others so you can sample all the burgers there.  If you don't know anything about Gordon Ramsay at all, know that he thinks beef should always be cooked medium rare.  You better speak up if you don't like your burgers cooked this way.  All of the burgers are really good, but obviously I'm biased and I think the real winner is the Hell's Kitchen burger.  As for the fresh roasted chili dawg, it honestly tasted like a regular hot dog with too much toppings and it didn't impress me too much.  The roasted jalapeno poppers tasted just like your regular poppers, but it is presented nicely in shot glasses and it's like playing a game of Russian roulette.  Out of all of the poppers, one is supposed to pack the most heat, but you won't know which one it is until you're all done sharing and eating them.  The parmesan fries come with two dipping sauces.  One is a truffle aioli and the other one looks like regular ketchup, but it isn't.  It almost tastes like there's curry or something mixed in there.  Anyway, the portion for this one is huge so make sure you bring a couple of people so you can share.  The food is a little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for and it is worth the money!  The burgers usually range around $13 and up and the sides are usually around $11 and up.  If you are a member of Total Rewards, present your card to get discount on the meals as well as earn points.  You can sign up to become a member inside the casino before heading to BurGR to eat.  The food has been consistently amazing each time I have been here, but I can't say the same for the service.  Sometimes I've received excellent service and during other times, I've received just okay service.  One time, my bf and I received free Parmesan Truffle fries to make up for the food taking too long to come out.  We didn't even say anything, the waitress took it upon herself to give us the freebie.  I feel as though they really do try to give you the best experience and will go out of their way to do so.  One time we were seated at the bar and the service there was actually so much better compared to the tables.  I feel like the service here is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"The banana pudding shake is worth bragging about.  The burger..Guy Feiri's was better. Sorry Ramsay.  I think the bun is also okay- something about sesame seeds just not a fan of."}
{"text":"Came here for an anniversary snack and was highly disappointed. We were sat in the front next to the fire and it was extremely hot and crowded in there. The burgers had no flavor and nothing special nor did the fries. The best part of the meal was the beer. It was definitely not worth $80!"}
{"text":"Not worth the money! Came here during a trip to Vegas in February as I am a big Gordon Ramsay fan but I have to say I was so disappointed. The place is all hype! The burgers were so dry, tasteless, and sounded so much better on the menu than they actually were (not to mention they average $15 each). To add insult to injury, the truffle fries and onion rings (which you have to pay $11 extra EACH for) were so salty and terrible. My advice, bypass BurGR go to Holsteins Shakes & Buns at the Cosmo!"}
{"text":"Most amazing burger of my life, and has ruined all other burgers for me!  The Hells Kitchen burger with a shake! Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"This place gets WAY too much hype.  Oily, unpressed food and service.  Will not return.  No grill marks on my burger.  No flavor.  WACK!  My service was horrible!  My server was preoccupied to perform required tasks such as taking my order and filling my glass.  I had to flag down other server/busboy to take care of these things.  My coffee cup sat empty most of the time there.  Sweet Potato Fries-standard; jalapeño mayo-no heat Truffle Parmesan Fries-not fried to my liking what i would consider a crisp fry.  aïoli was weak and unimpressed.  at least real parm was used however it was not well distributed.  not impressed at all  Farm Burger-unimpressed.  Duck breast bacon was gimmicky at best.  Nothing to report other than oily wet unimpressed burger.  Asked for med rare and pretty much got a rare burger.  Server took forever to come and check on us by the time she did my burger was almost eaten.  She was so bad that I did not want another burger.    Chanterelle Burger-unimpressed; best part was the arugula and  figgy-onion jam  Britannia Burge- unimpressed mango chutney + arugula  get the pattern?  make overly oily and bad burgers and add toppings on them...  Best part was leaving knowing that I would never come back.  Another celeb establishment blown up with super hype from the general public.  Joke"}
{"text":"Service was great, and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  We enjoyed the Farm Burger, Hells Kitchen Burger, and the Truffle Fries.  I am still thinking about those fries!!  :)"}
{"text":"There seems to always be a line for this place, so I recommend coming here during off-hours or 10-15 min. before it opens.   There's a nice selection of burgers suited for every taste bud. I got the Euro Burger, which has goat cheese, arugula and truffle. The truffle flavor was mellow, but the goat cheese and arugula gave it a nice flavor. The medium beef came out perfectly pink with no oozing blood (!!!). The truffle fries were steak cut; it had a nice truffle flavor and crisp (even though they were steak fries) to it. Worth a visit, but not worth waiting in line for more than 30 mins!  There's also a pretty decent selection of beer for all you beer drinkers out there!"}
{"text":"Our first time here.was sketchy at first. Went on a Thursday evening. Hardly any wait time. Husband and I both ordered a burger, however we shared fries which was good because the portion was huge. The burgers were cooked exactly how we wanted it. They weren't pushy on up selling drinks and food which I liked. They don't have you put your name down for waiting, you stand in line which not sure I liked. It was a good atmosphere. Burgers are around 14-17 a piece which does not include fries. I would recommend this place to friends...."}
{"text":"When you want to experience a better burger...an elevated burger - this is definitely a place to seek out.  The place is constantly packed but we were lucky to only have to wait 25 minutes before being sat.   The service was great.  The place was a bit crammed. But the quality of the food more than made up for it.   The burgers were cooked perfectly. And the fries were unnecessary but we ordered them anyway.   The beer list was ok and priced accordingly for Vegas.  All in all, I would definetly wait in line again to have another burger the next time I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Long time have be back here for  lunch . I like the wing a lot is very crunchy and tastes and the chicken burger very good but the gooey fries is very fulfilling just by looking at ."}
{"text":"This is a laid back Gordon Ramsay outlet with excellent fare. The sandwiches were fantastic! The fries left a bit to be desired. If they were better this place would be an instant 5 out of 5.   We ate at the bar which was enjoyable. The stools had backs which make it more palatable than many bar stools. The beer choices were ok with a few good craft choices. The price was excellent if you like good beer and bad if you like simple mainstream beer like Coors (all choices were the same price).  This is definitely a spot I want to visit again in the future!"}
{"text":"Best. Burger. In. Vegas.  If you're a lover of fries, definitely try the truffle Parmesan fries. I was very pleased and the waiting time was well worth it."}
{"text":"Save your money and your time.  Tasteless food and lousy service.  There goes an hour and half and $35. I'll never get back.  If this is as good as Gordon Ramsey can do I don't understand how he ever succeeded!"}
{"text":"This place was disgusting! It's extreamly loud and tight. The food is over priced and not worth the money. I expected so much better based off the reviews ! One plus was craft beer. But we waited awhile for our burgers only for a expensive fries to never come ? The waiter took the fries off of the bill but still..... The only plus was the craft beer and the ....... Nope just the craft beer. I also have to say- I hate open seating on a Casino. I like to walk I to a restaurant and not see everyone standing on line or waking loudly past."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay Burgr is a prime example of everything that is wrong with a modern restaurant.   Start with the staff, horrible.  They text us when our table was ready (I like that idea), however when we arrived to be seated we had to wait another 15 minutes while our table was getting ready and we were corralled several times to get out of the way by a bunch of scantily dressed host staff (kids).  The atmosphere, loud and annoying.  The food, even worse.  Start with greasy fries and the worst dipping sauces, mayo but not mayo for the Europeans, and catchup but not catchup for the Americans.  Both sauces were terrible and the fries dripped with grease.  Next the onion rings were even filled with more grease and the batter didn't stick to the onions.  You had to eat them with a knife and fork and the sauce was another disappointment.  A good dipping sauce for onion rings is chilled thick ranch dressing, sounds simple but very few places provide a good ranch.  The stuff they served here was so bad I could not eat it.  Next was the shake or what they called a shake.  It was more of a parfait concoction with various flavors but it didn't resemble a shake in the slightest.  When you are craving good old ice-cream forget ordering this crap, it isn't even close.  The only good thing about the shake was the cookie.  Finally the burgr, another huge disappointment.  Rather small but thick and undercooked.  My wife cannot eat red meat so she ordered hers well done and of course it was completely red in the middle.  The staff argued that it was in fact well done, we were already miffed about the shake so we didn't argue, just vowed to write this review and never come to this place again.  When you consider paying an average of $35 for a burger, fry and shake the price is insane and what you get for that price is criminal.  Never felt so ripped off before.  I love the food channel and enjoyed watching Gordon do his thing on TV but this restaurant has changed all that.  I have zero respect for this marketing fool who is selling overpriced garbage."}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen burgr  medium rare, perfectly juicy and fatty. It had the perfect kick.  The farm burgr is not balanced. Too much meat and no veggies, so it wasn't that good, but the egg was nice and runny. The pork Bao meat was dry but and sauce was spot on."}
{"text":"Sigh, leave it to Gordon Ramsay to beat Americans at their own game. Cute girls in tight dresses, cute boys in not so cute tight shirts, and bombass burgers.  There was a long line leading to the restaurant but luckily they had a handy call back system that will text you when your table is ready. 45 minutes later, we were seated.  Almost everyone at our table ordered something different so I was able to try a variety of burgers and sides.  APPETIZERS: We started off with Maui Onion Rings and Jalapeno Poppers. The Onion Rings were amazeballs and the Poppers were very conveniently separated into 6 shot glasses.  BURGRS: Hell's Kitchen Burger, Euro Burger, Farm  Burger, Hog Burger and a Fish Sandwich. I specifically remember the Euro and Farm. Both were cooked juicy and perfectly medium. On the Euro, the tangy goat cheese and over roasted tomatoes were delicious. I highly recommend the Farm burger as well, the duck bacon went great with the runny egg yolk.  My mom's friend raved about her fish sandwich for days. SIDES: Sweet Potato Fries and Truffle Parmesan Fries. I have never been a fan of sweet potatoes, so naturally, I never liked them in fry form either. These on the other hand, covered in Vanilla Powdered Sugar with Honey Jalapeno Mayo were something I could snack on for days. My brother said that if Gordon Ramsays jizz was made of Honey Jalapeno Mayo, he'd take it to the face. The Truffle Parmesan Fries were alright. The only thing that stuck out was the Truffle Aioli for dipping.  It's hard to pick places to eat in Vegas because there are great restaurants everywhere you look. I recommend stopping by here, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Continuing my Gordon Ramsey experience, next on the list Gordon Ramsey burger. His steak house that i tried first was fantastic! So I'm assuming his burger joint would be the same. It was! Fantastic!  First off the ambiance is great, lots of hustle and bustle going on. All the servers are active and constantly moving. My server was great. Extremely knowledgable of the menu which is great, getting her opinion was very helpful because everything on the menu looked amazing and was hard to choose!  I ended up trying an appetizer, a burger, side dish nod dessert. For appetizer I had the hummus with grilled flat bread and veggie sticks. It was excellent! The hummus had so much flavor! I couldn't stop eating it, it was so good. Oh for a drink I had this amazing shake! A crème brûlée Oreo cookie shake! Sooo good! Talk about taking a shake to the next level! Presentation is beautiful and the taste is even better! For my burger I had the Euro burger. truffle aïoli + goat cheese + arugula + oven roasted tomato. Oh my heavens it was delicious! Perfectly cooked, and bursting with flavor! Everything in the burger went together well like perfect harmony. My side dish was Parmesan truffle fries. Addicting! Fresh cut fries covered with Parmesan with a truffle sauce for dipping! Soo good! Also came with a second sauce, a BBQ ketchup with an Asian taste to it of some sort which was amazing! For dessert I went with his signature dish the sticky toffee pudding. Only I come to find out that he prepares it differently at each restaurant. This version was a cold version that was like a push-up ice cream pop! Delish!  Yet another fantastic experience at his restaurant. Went in with a smile, left with a bigger smile like the joker!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm...it was ok. I expected a little more flavor and a larger portion.  When I go out for burgers, I don't want to be hungry after I eat."}
{"text":"The Hells Kitchen Burger is hands down  the best burger I have ever eaten without a shadow of doubt. The patty was perfectly cooked and very very tasty. I really loved the roasted jalapeño. Absolutely fantastic! The Truffle Parmesan fries were also amazing. The service was wonderful. Decor is cool - liked the flames in the windows.  However I have to say I was disappointed by the female servers uniforms. Yes I know this is Vegas and there are expectations to be met but seriously not one of them looked remotely comfortable in their ridiculously short dresses. Absolutely no need for this exploitation anywhere but when the food is this good honestly it degrades the whole experience. Maybe if the guys were wearing short shorts or something equivalent this may be overlooked but the fact this is so misogynistic leaves a sour taste.  I'd have given 5 stars but for that."}
{"text":"Oh no!!! I forgot to take pictures...  Oh well. I guess I can do this review without that.   My boyfriend and I love to watch all of Gordon Ramsay's shows! So of course we had to come here to try this place out.  Our burger was cooked perfectly! We got the Hell's Kitchen burger. And it was pretty good! Well, there was like a whole avocado in there so of course it was yummy.  The fries were potato-y and yum. I don't know if it was worth ~$8 for those fries buuut it complimented the burger as it should.   Oh, one thing though. I thought the service was slow. I felt like I was in Hell's Kitchen that day, and Gordon Ramsay was in the back yelling at the contestants or something. Like seriously, where's the food man!  Overall, the food was good as expected. Service was slow but they could have been extra busy. I just don't know if this place is so special that I would HAVE to come here for my next burger with avocado.   Still love Gordon Ramsay though. He's a boss."}
{"text":"This place is  worth trying! I recommend the chicken wings, onion rings, turkey burger, and milk shake."}
{"text":"We were seated rather quickly for a party of 5. Our order was taken within minutes. Appetizers came out fast.... then the wait began.... waiting for our burgers... while waiting, no one came by to check on us, server seemed to disappear... had to flag him down for water. Over 15 minute wait and no one checked on us. Water boy looks clueless.. Food was good..."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers. From the bread, the choices, the sweet potato fries, the service.. everything was really good. I was impressed since it's hard to actually find a decent burger in Vegas that's made well and not overpriced!"}
{"text":"Had a very good burger there this week. I still prefer the burger from Holsteins but it was a solid burger. The dishes I found amazing were the jalapeño poppers and the wings. I will definitely go back for the apps!"}
{"text":"The appetizer was amazing.  After that we have been waiting 35 minutes for burgers. Yes burgers. Medium rare. The servers have been nice, although it has been a complete sausage fest. That's right not a single female server in sight.  The food won't matter at this point, I feel forgotten.  Finally got burgers.  Medium rare for me was raw, not even rare.  I think that says enough."}
{"text":"Came with family expecting subpar service because of Yelp, but was really pleasantly surprised by the friendliest, most helpful people. We had four people and got the onion rings, jalapeno poppers, and split two Hell's Kitchen burgers. Everything was amazing but the onion rings had my heart. They were thick, juicy, well-seasoned, and came with two good sauces on the side.   The jalapeno poppers came in these cute individual shot glasses with sauce on the bottom and were awesome! There's a surprise very spicy one in the group, which I tried to avoid by grabbing a smaller popper, but chose incorrectly. It wasn't actually that spicy and was pretty happy to get another spicy one later. I almost wished all of them were spicy.   They could tell we were splitting out burgers, so they cut them both in half for us with individual toothpicks in each.  Service was awesome and the food was great. Really impressed!"}
{"text":"O que era esse farm burger galera?! Podem ir de olho fechado..  O sabor do bacon de pato, o ovinho mole e o hamburger bem temperado são indescritíveis!!  O atendimento poderia melhorar só um pouquinho, até porque eles foram bastante amigáveis.. Tomei uma arrogant bastard ale para acompanhar a comida."}
{"text":"Get the Gordon Ramsey burger. It's an off the menu item! You wouldn't want to eat any other burger after this one!"}
{"text":"Burgers and pork belly steamed bun tacos with sweet potato fries so good. Sweet  unique milk shakes to finish off."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and I want to come here when I go to Vegas if I want to have a burger.  Of course, like any restaurant made popular by a celebrity chef, expect a wait. If you have a group of people, except an extra long as wait and put your name in much longer than you expect to eat if you're going during dinner time. For couples, there is a line for two that goes by faster than you think. But like I said there is still a wait with no seating. While you're in line you also have a chance to look at a menu which is always nice. But, they do not show the drink options until you sit down. No fear they do sell beer.  So, even with that said, I still loved this placed because of two reasons: the burger is made perfectly and our waitress (but I hope they are all like this) new her shit. As soon as we sat down she went through all parts of the menu describing popular favorites and her own in great detail. When we were ordering she offered the options of what to add to our burger because she had mention people before expecting more. To clarify, we ordered the blue burger and all it comes with is blue cheese and arugula and she had offered sun dried tomatoes at no extra charge or with extra charge bacon. My point is she was well prepared and clarified our order to a t. For an appetizer we order the bau buns which had delicious pork and Vietnamese people in little Saigon would probably kill us for spending that much but hey they were delicious. With our burger we had the parmesaen fries which come with a truffle mayo I believe which was redonculous and house made ketchup which is also good and some house made ketchups taste awful. By this time we were happy we split the burger because we were so full, or at least I was. And they aren't huge so if you don't want to share you don't have to.  This place is so good, so please give it a chance!"}
{"text":"I love Gordon Ramsey. Love love love him. We had to stop in here to try his burger spot. The food is well priced, and the service was good. The food didn't give me a wow factor and was just ok. That night after we ate I got horrible sick, and was up all night on the toilet till the morning. It was the worst case of food poisoning I'd ever gotten. I will never eat there again. Sorry Gordon! :("}
{"text":"The Brits steal everything from us and always believe they can make it better (with zero creativity or craft on their part, I may add). The British Invasion bastardized rock-and-roll, and now Gordon Ramsey rolls in and charges $16 for a slab of beef, two buns and some English cheddar, and lots of stupid Americans fall for it, of course. Burgers are an American institution.  He knows full well that no one here wants to spend a dime on bland, colorless British food, so he decides to hijack the American burger instead and internationalize it. Yuck. On my visit the fries were soggy (European style evidently - bleh), the burger was dry and the atmosphere was disconcerting at best. You're far better off spending half the price on something yummy from Shake Shack instead.   So sayeth I."}
{"text":"I took my family here for Father's Day and they still can't stop raving about it. Neither can I. We didn't have to wait in the long line because we had four people in the party. The lady at the front asked for my phone number and said she'd text me when our table was ready. It didn't take long to receive the text and the hostess led us to our table. The waitress was enthusiastic as she told us about the menu.  We ordered wings for an appetizer and they were great. I ordered a Farm Burger on the recommendation of the waitress and it was absolutely delicious. The meat was medium-rare, just how I liked it, and it didn't take long to finish the burger. The fries were equally as good and an order of two of them were more enough for the four of us.  We had just enough room for dessert and we ordered the Oreo shake with creme brulee. So good! I wish I hadn't been so full from earlier or else I would have ate more of it.  This was the first time I've visited a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and it did not disappoint at all. I definitely plan to come back soon."}
{"text":"My favorite chef!   This burger joint was awesome!!! I had the truffle burger and did not know a burger could taste so good. The truffle fries were also delicious.   My boyfriend had the Gordon Ramsay burger with mushrooms and peppers and that was super tasty.   The manager came over and talk to us and told us a few stories about when Gordon visits, which were really fun stories.   I want to come back to this one and all the rest of his restaurants :-)   Gordon really hit this one out of the park :-)!!!"}
{"text":"The sum of the parts?  A strong 3-stars. Keep that ship running tight and I'll be excited once again to bring visiting friends to this celebrity joint.   As of this writing, there are 3,727 reviews of BurGR. In a minute, there will be +1. Everyone wants to eat here, and everyone wants to review the experience. While the whole experience is what people rate, my burger alone was worth a 5-star rating. It was bar-none the best I've had in my 36 years of living. Since my first visit last year, I've had two more, and they were just as excellent, and cooked to medium rare perfection. That was difficult to find back in North Carolina, but at BurGR, the consistency is there. Cheers to the chef!  What I wanted from a dining experience here is best articulated in Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential. I intended to test BurGR via his description of an ace restaurant. I would be submissive, requesting nothing from the menu, but to have our waiter decide for me while also pairing his choice with a red wine.  That first visit? Flawless. All perfect pairings based on my stated tastes, and all a surprise as our waiter volunteered no information about what would be served. He joked with our party, left us extra BurGR coasters to take home, and was a complete joy, even bringing me--unsolicited--a list of everything I had been served.  For dessert? A fancy, rich milkshake, with its spooned dollop of whipped cream on top.  BurGR would rate an easy 4 stars and possibly 5 were it not for unfortunate inconsistencies in service. Of the three times I have been, there was one near disastrous outing.  In sum, my dining companion and I had three different waitstaff attend to us, not all at once, but scattered throughout the evening. The changing of the guard was never communicated to us, instead we were left to wonder who this new person was. The worst part was the long periods of time in between requests and checking in on us, the last of which almost caused us to up and leave without paying. We had waited upwards of 15 minutes, had asked for our waiter (whoever that was), and were not paid any attention until we stood to push in our chairs and leave.   Then, voila! Our new waiter appeared. Thankfully that was addressed without embarrassing us or his fellow staff. Such service should knock this review down to 2-stars as it was the extreme opposite of my other two visits--disappointing, aggravating, and I just felt sad for Gordon--but the food and drinks redeem most everything. Worth a return, but take stock of how the staff seem to be functioning before really settling in."}
{"text":"Think you've tried every burger...... Think again.  We tried this place just on a hunch and don't regret it one bit. We all thought we tried every burger out there but how we were wrong.  We each tried a different burger, and when it came we split each burger. WE MELTED AT EVERY BITE.  The wait was not bad and the price was decent. A must try when your on the strip."}
{"text":"If it's GR then it's got to be good. Womp Womp have you ever gone to a Ramsey establishment? Because if you have you wouldn't even need to be looking at this review to decide if it's anything less than amazing.   Go. Now. There's a line probably."}
{"text":"Hands down my new favorite place in Vegas. The food is so amazing, especially their Truffle Fries. We were so hungry after a long morning and waiting in line. The worker was sweet enough to hand us the Truffle Fries immediately and comp it for us. The customer service is superb and the burgers were tasty. The prices are also affordable in my opinion. Because of the food and the way the staff is attentive and treats us I will continue to come here and bring more people with me."}
{"text":"I waited for hour and half for the worst burger I ever had .... I don't recommend this place  It is just name for nothing"}
{"text":"Went on vacation looking forward to going to all three Chef Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas tried the BurGR first.  Let me tell you that place gives Chef Ramsay a bad name.  He needs to make a personal visit and put that place in check like on hells kitchen.  I am a big fan of Chef Ramsay but after the first experience i didnt go to any other of the restuarants there.  The service was horrible are waiter was never around.  Then the Burgers came out and wasnt cooked very well at all.  And the food was cold.  Four ohter tables recieved their food over three other tables that was there before them.  Even to pay are check was a pain.  We had to chase down are waiter to pay for the food.  Its was a horrible experience.  I wont go back unless Chef Ramsay takes care of the problems. PLEASE CHEF RAMSAY GO TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything about this burger joint is awesome. We had the Euro Burger and it was an other worldly experience!! The truffle oil is such a fantastic choice! And the Jalapeño poppers were just the best I've ever had!! I also liked that they were using iPads for us to order drinks and look at images of the food. Overall a great experience and highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my oh my. My family went to Vegas for a four day trip and saw this restaurant over and over again while passing by, we finally gave in and decided to go for lunch. My mom had some sort of member card and promotion for the casino so we were seated in no more than five minutes. I ordered the veggie burgr with sweet potato fries and let me tell you that it was THE BEST veggie burger I've ever consumed in my entire life. No exaggeration. The sweet potato fries were also bomb af. My mom and brother ordered the truffle fries and they were amaaaazziinnggg. Furthermore, the employees were all so kind and helpful, despite the consistent rush. I have no complaints about this restaurant. I'm from the Bay Area and I am so down to drive to Vegas just to eat here again. If you're in Vegas, please do yourself a favor and eat at this restaurant, your body will thank you."}
{"text":"My hubby says 2 1/2 stars and it was only for the ambiance, not the food. I think I have to agree! I've been to his steakhouse and was happy with my food there, so I was expecting some good food, especially with all the reviews. Sadly I have been excited to try this spot for a long time and I finally did. It was very packed for a week night, around 6 p.m. When we left, there was actually a long line forming. Upon first entering, I was really impressed by the fire lining the window as part of the decoration. The hostesses were standing around, greeted us, and took us right to our table. I was surprised how busy it was in there. There are huge TV screens covering the walls (sports bar-ish but with high price tags), loud music (Vegas all the way), and Gordon's pic all over the place, on the menu, on the wall, everywhere. At first I was very impressed with the whole thing.   When we sat down our waitress Tammy came over and appeared to be a in a big rush. I ordered the Farm Burger, Hog Burger (love the name), and we got Maui Onion Rings and Truffle Fries. The burgers we got were supposed to be their speciality, so I was really expecting something special. Ummm the Hog Burger was not memorable at all. I can't say I enjoyed it one bit and almost felt like I was just eating it because it was so darn expensive!! ($17 with being a rewards member). The burger wasn't even that big and it just barely had any taste. The toppings were arugula and some sort of sauce, again nothing memorable. The Farm Burger had a nice piece of bacon on it, cheese, and an egg (doesn't sound original but in comparison to the Hog burger, it was decent). I really don't feel like with the high price here for the burgers, these burgers were worth the price. I hate to say it, but the burger was borderline dry. The Maui onion rings and garlic dipping sauce was tasty, but nothing that would bring me back to this restaurant just for that. The truffle fries were thick cut fries and had an overwhelming truffle taste, almost to the point where you felt gross eating such oily fries.   I am glad I went and tried it and now my curiosity is over and I will not be back. With the Ipad menu, Iphone for giving feedback/review along with the check, and all the TV's, I think the high price of the food was going towards the gadgets instead of good quality food."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place. My friends and I were dying to try this place. Our wait was about an hour and 15 minutes. Some may say it's not worth the wait. Honestly, I can see why, but for my friends and I this was definitely worth the wait. Before I begin, let me say, the price may not reflect the portion size. However if you compare to any other burger places like Unami Burger and many others, the pricing isn't really that bad.  The server we had provided great service. He took great care of us. He checked up constantly on us, never too much and not too little. He gave us many suggestions and explained each burger. Now most of us decided to get the Farm Burger. The Farm Burger came with a patty, obviously, fried eggs, greens, and duck bacon. I was thinking to myself, what the hell is duck bacon? I love duck, but I hate bacon, but the duck part had me. The burger was amazing. The duck bacon tasted like, well duck and bacon. I don't know how else to explain it. And the fried egg  complimented the other ingredients so well. My other friend had the Britannia Burger which came with mango lassi. At first my friend was skeptical about it. He said there was no way this was going to work on a burger. Well he was wrong that's for sure. I only had a bite of his burger, but from that bite it was really good. We also ordered Honey- Pig Bao Buns which is an appetizer that consists of roasted pork belly. The only way I can describe this dish is those pecking duck white buns you get at Chinese restaurants. Instead of duck, it's pork belly. The pork belly comes in a white steamed bun with cucumbers, radish, cilantro, and a honey-hoision sauce.  The pork belly was slightly crispy with a little bit of fat. So it was very juicy and tender.   We also ordered truffle fries and sweet potato fries. Usually I hate sweet potato fries, but these fries were delicious. The truffle fries on the other hand were a bit disappointing. Not because it tasted bad, but it was just a bit too salty. The fries came with a truffle aioli which was amazing, and also a roasted jalepeno steeped in honey and mayo sauce.   Finally for dessert we had their homemade Toffee Pudding Push up Pop which was delicious. We also had the Oreo milkshake with creme brulee pudding on top. Now that was amazing. The Oreo milkshake was light and not too sweet, same goes with the pudding. It was one of the best shakes I had in awhile. It definitely beats Serendipity's frozen hot chocolates which is a total rip off."}
{"text":"Delicious meal.  Loved the farm burger and hubby ordered the special pork burger that he loved and I thought was good, but not as good as mine.  Fries were good.  Lots of beers to choose from and I tried something new that is now my favorite (but I can't remember the name!).  Only regret is that we were too full to try the shake with chocolate hazelnut.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burger. The hog burger is piled on top of a toasted bun with sesame seeds. The patty is wrapped with bacon and topped with shredded pork, cole slaw, crispy onions and pickle.   Truffle fries are indulgent. Topped with fresh shredded Parmesan cheese and served with ketchup and a delicate truffle aoli.   Must try if your visiting Vegas and near the Planet Hollywood casino!"}
{"text":"God I wanted to love this place so much! I'm such a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey and I had been pestering my boyfriend to eat here with me.  When we got there, around 1PM on a Wednesday, there was no wait. We were immediately seated and waited on. Between the two of us, we ordered the Just Fries. Hell's Kitchen Burger, and Farm Burger. It took a while to get our food, but that wasn't a big deal for us.   Just Fries: These were really disappointing. I LOVE FRIES, but my problem with the fries was how hard and stale they were. You would think that thicker cut fries would be softer in the middle, but the toughness of the fries were meh. I will say that the ketchups that came out with the fries were fantastic; they really saved the fries.  Farm Burger: I only got to have a bite of this burger, but it was pretty good. I do think it needed the addition of a vegetable or roasted tomato to overcome the heaviness of the cheese and egg.  Hell's Kitchen Burger: I was so excited for this burger! Roasted jalapenos? Jalapeno pesto aioli? Oven-roasted tomatoes? Sounds like a flavor smorgasbord, right? Wrong. Although the meat was well seasoned, I was so overwhelmed by the lack of kick in this burger. The roasted jalapeno had to kick to it and i barely tasted the aioli. This was a burger that i expected so much more out of and just didn't get that kick from.  All in all, the food was just okay. Not impressive, at least not in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here with my family for a total of five people. We had a bit of a wait but the host was professional and nice and sat us as soon as she could. The food was amazing and they have a really fun beer menu too, oh and pudding shakes!  We started off with the jalapeño poppers which are served with one popper containing seeds so its a bit of a roulette. They were fun and were super tasty. My burger was the Farm burger with duck breast bacon and a fried egg. It is just as amazing as it sounds, perfectly fried egg (a little goopy yolk), cooked perfect medium...highly recommended. We tried the three different types of fries, loved the truffle fries and really enjoyed the curry ketchup with the \"just fries\".  The service was exceptional we had Dorota and Chad and they were genuinely personable and attentive. Emily the manager was equally attentive and friendly. We are def coming back...theres 4 more puddig shakes i need to try after all:) BurGR captures what Chef Ramsay is known for, great food with great service."}
{"text":"Soooooo amazing! One of my favorite restaurants!  I come to Vegas just for this....literally. Never disappoints!   I always get the Hell's Kitchen Burger. Soooooo bomb! The cheese, the jalapeno, the meat, the avo....mmmmmmmm!!! It's a total mouthgasm! I get it prepared medium.  It's also great when accompanied by some parmesan truffle fries (complete with the garlic aioli, of course).   This time I also tried the Fury Wings (which my friend ordered as \"furry wings\"). They were delicious! Instead of dressing, they came with bleu cheese crumbles. Best bleu cheese crumbles ever, as weird as that sounds. The wings didn't even need dressing. They were amazing! Very different, but in a good way. I will be sure to start getting these when I come.   The staff is always prompt and friendly. It's nice to come to a restaurant that has employees who are consistently on top of things.  Be prepared for a line. It is a popular place but it usually goes by pretty quickly. Platinum and Silver Rewards card holders also get priority seating. If you have one of those, please give me a call next time you go :)  Overall, I really love this place and highly suggest it! Besides, Gordon Ramsey is sexy"}
{"text":"Good burger!  With almost 3000 reviews on here, not sure if mine will really matter.  I have been to several of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, and find them all to be really really good.  He knows what he is doing.  Now, I'll say I have had better burgers....but this is still really good."}
{"text":"Went on a whim while in planet hollywood and food was fantastic!  I had the Euro burger and my son had the Hell's kitchen.  Both were great.  We split an order of fries and that was plenty for two.  Total with a good tip was 50$ but it was such a great experience, worth every penny even on my meager teacher, single mom salary!!  My 16 yo son loves Gordon (watches everything he is on) and was so excited to eat at one of his restaurants.  The only reason I dropped down a star was upon leaving I tried to ask the hostesses(there was like 4 girls jumbled up at hostess station) about a shirt for my son and the hostess acted like I was bothering her. They were not busy it was not crowded it was just girls( workers) bunched up talking so I know she wasn't stressed over seating people. I was willing and ready to pay whatever the price so my son could have a Burgr shirt but she was really kind of rude. She asked in a rude way what size and when I said 2xl she said very rudely, \":We only have those sizes in white.\"  My son was a little embarrassed.  At that point he said he did not want a shirt he did not like the white.  I tried to look online to order him the grey but the restaurant did not have an online way to order that I could find. I would have thought Gordon would have been a better business man then that, he's missing out on an opportunity to cash in.  Anyhow the snooty hostess did not bother me all that much as I am proud of my almost 6 ft 200 plus 16 yo and haters gonna hate.  So the hostess' attitude cost the place a star.  We are going to go again next time though and we have decided to try his other two places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! The bun was so soft, meat well seasoned....the best Parmesan truffle fries (salty but worth it)! Wish we were able to eat there more than once on our trip."}
{"text":"The service here is really the hostess are sweet and give a good vibe when you first walk in! Like many will say the Uber Burger is the way to go. If you are looking for a good burger spot on the strip I defiantly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"One great burger! Very good! I just wish the price would include a small side. Service was also a tad slow. However I would visit again in the future."}
{"text":"Another pricey Vegas restaurant that's mediocre at best. My burger was good but nothing special, it was kind of lacking until I requested the spicy mayo.  The fries were ok, plenty to share between two people. The dipping sauces were different and fun. Was it worth $25 for a burger,1/2 and order of fries and a glass of water? Not really."}
{"text":"Best Burger Bar None in Vegas!!!  I have tried many a burger in Vegas, and this includes the fancy hotels. Gordon Ramsey delivers! From his \"benchmark\" hamberger roll, to the juicy (medium rare please) burger...you will be salivating.  Don't even get me started on the fries or milkshakes. Positively addictive. Can't wat to get back there sooner than later."}
{"text":"Wait was not as long as expected (around 25 mins) and they even send texts to your phone as your table is ready, a very nice opportunity to walk around rather than wasting time standing in a line.   I ordered the Chanterelle burger, Truffle Parmesan fries, and a chocolate shake. The burger was fantastic, one of the best I've ever had. The fries were good as well but a bit strong for my taste. They were good due to the refreshing experience the fries offered; never before have I tasted anything like it. The shake was top notch as well. The bill holder is fitted with an iPod touch so customers can conveniently leave their remarks.   The table I sat at seemed a bit close to other patrons on both sides of me, sort of like a speed dating row of tables. But I didn't find it uncomfortable. It sometimes gave my party a chance to recommend a good dish to someone just being seated. I'm sure it could also work vice versa.   I had a wonderful experience at BurGR. Couldn't recommend it any more."}
{"text":"When in Vegas, I like to try the restaurants that are only here. You can eat at Chili's anywhere.  I checked the reviews on Burgr and was concerned about the wait time. Maybe we got lucky, but on a Friday night at 7:00 we had about a 30 minute wait. Not bad.  The staff was on the run the entire time with great service.  Of course, I ordered a burger which was really good. My wife had the noodle salad. She was a little surprised when it came out chilled. Nevertheless, it was good.  Overall, our experience was good. Dinner for two with a beer and cocktail for $60. In Vegas, that's great.  Not sure if we'll be back since there are so many options but would recommend."}
{"text":"The aioli for the fries is great! I had the pork burger and it lacked seasoning...it was super bland. My girlfriend had the mushroom burger, it was the best I've tasted."}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to eat at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant last night........ The excitement slowly went away.  First of all they need to decide how they are going to seat people. I walked up to the reception podium and asked what the protocol was and was told that for my party of 3 it would be about 45min(seems to be the norm) I asked if it was faster to stand in line and was told those people already had their names on the list. \"Lies\" The people in line were just in line and told the receptionist how many in their party and were sat about 5 min later. And the 2 bar style tables at the front of the restaurant were never occupied through out the night hmmm.  Now to the menu, Very greasy onion rings that fell apart when I would pick them up.  This might be me nagging but if your a burger place wouldn't you offer burger sliders since those seem to be popular these days? They do have chicken sliders on the appetizer menu but you only get 2. My draft beer wasn't very cold, at least a chilled glass would be nice. My American burger was as dry as the Desert Air!  The French fries need some flavor. The best part of the meal was my daughters chocolate milkshake.   Needless to say I'm almost positive that you are paying for the name at this restaurant. One American burger, order of regular fries, onion rings, chicken slider app, milkshake and a mixed drink and a beer........... $ mid 80s!  Do you realize how many Double Doubles(In n Out) I could have bought!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Fast and clean.  Long line for check-in but you don't have to stand in it, they will gladly send a text to your phone to alert you when they have your table ready.  The Food:  Hands down the best burger I have ever had in my life.  Elegant simplicity and cooked to perfection.  The parmesan black truffle fries are a must for any carb lover.  The Honey Bao Buns are to die for.  I am planning my next trip to Vegas just to go back to this establishment."}
{"text":"This place was great. Very chic, modern, and Ramsay like. Pricing is reasonable and the food was amazing. The fries we couldn't even finish because the burgers were out of this world. Absolutely fantastic. The only flaw about this experience was the wait, but who can complain when one is in a world known chef restaurant with mouth watering food. I'll tell you, it was worth the wait. Sidenote: they do not have ranch or BBQ sauce here"}
{"text":"Picture perfect. The food that is, not Gordon Ramsey, who's face is everywhere, a face only a mother could love. The burger was just great looking, unfortunately it was seasoned to death, I've never tasted such a salty patty. The onions really combined for that sweet and savory combo, but I couldn't get over the overly salted patty. The Sweet potato fries were great, the sugar and sauce made a great flavor profile. I won't be coming back, but it was a good burger experience."}
{"text":"Really great burgers. I had the Farm Burger  and I loved it. I came with 3 other people and we all loved it. The onion rings were fantastic too. We also had the Oreo shake, it was great."}
{"text":"The burger and onion rings weren't bad. But Shake #4 (creme brulee and Oreo shake) was AMAZING!! It was literally the best I had in my life.   The waiting line wasn't too long, but when we finally made it to the front of the line, the hosts seemed to ignore us and instead helped the random people coming up to them with questions."}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes to be seated in a half empty restaurant at lunch time. That was odd.  The service was slow and inattentive, and the food mediocre.  However, it's a burger joint, and I am sure it's difficult to crank out burgers all day and have them all be perfect.  I will try it again some day, because I'm a fan of Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch. I've eaten here before, but it was her first time. So we ordered the jalapeño poppers to start off with. It was really spicy but tasted really good. I can't really handle spicy hot but it was manageable. They come in shot glasses with a dipping sauce. I'd recommend this for a group so everyone can try it.   I ordered the farm burger medium. My wife ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. The farm burger comes with an egg inside. The egg definitely makes it taste delicious. I think the next time I grill up some burgers at home I'm definitely putting a sunny side up egg inside. The runny yolk gives it a good taste that goes well with the bacon. The Hell's Kitchen burger comes with jalapeños inside. It was pretty good as well.   This place is a definite must try if you're close to Planet Hollywood and are looking for a good burger. Don't forget to order the truffle Parmesan fries! The sauces it comes with is bomb!"}
{"text":"Burger was good but the whole process of waiting forever to be seated, then waiting forever to get your food, at a space that is not cozy and doesn't make you want to stay, and paying much more for burgers and fries, is not worth it.  Wings were disappointing too.  If the burger had been amazing and the service great, I wouldn't mind but seriously, the place is not nice, the food is not great, the service is not good either...so save yourself some money and time and go somewhere else. Disappointed because I really like Chef Ramsey  As a suggestion, they should really change the girls uniforms!"}
{"text":"The truffle fries steal the show.... The burgers are good but I've had better. Limited selection of burgers that are not very creative. I would have expected more from Gordan Ramsey..."}
{"text":"I've missed multiple visits for very Vegas like reasons for Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  I finally made it here and was very pleased.  One note is to either go early or have someone wait in line for you at peak times because that line can go Disneyland long.   We both had the Gordon Ramsay Burger and it was delicious.  Paired with fries and you're a happy camper.  I got a shake too, which kinda put my meal over the top.  I highly recommend BurGR for a relatively inexpensive Vegas meal."}
{"text":"I can vouch for some one else's comment about hygiene as our server spent most of her time playing with her hair, running her hands through it etc before handing us our plates....not really what I would expect in any restaurant to be honest.  There is absolutely no organisation to the queue to be seated so there were people stood everywhere and you didn't know who was waiting to be seated or even seen to.  We were told there would be a 2 minute wait despite the fact there were loads of empty tables and servers stood around doing nothing.  The food took  ages to arrive and once it did it was cold, our server didn't even bother to come back and check if our food was OK!  My husband ordered the Parmesan truffle fries and it was like eating a bucket of salt.  We ordered a chocolate and caramel milkshake for dessert, the milkshake part was nice but the caramel on top was tasteless.   All in all I wouldn't bother eating here again. Burger probably would have been nice if it was actually hot but the rest of the food and service was utter tosh."}
{"text":"I have an idea....let's make everyone in line stand next to a burning hot fire. Sounds good."}
{"text":"This is not an overrated burger joint or just some celebrity money grab.  The food here is really good.  Try the Farm Burger which has egg and duck bacon on it.  It's seasoned really well and just a perfect burger.  We tried the truffle parmesan fries as well which were really good.  It's fairly expensive but as far as Vegas goes it's not any worse than anywhere else.  Really good service as well.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Last time I was here was 4 years ago and it was 5 stars then and it is 5 stars now.  What incredible service!  You have wonderful servers and that cannot be stressed enough, because no matter how good the food is the attitudes of the staff impact the experience and they are fantastic.  The food?  Still the best burger that I have ever had (Farmhouse this time) and those fries....to die for.  Reasonably priced, great atmosphere, great service, perfectly prepared food, I would go back to Vegas just to have this burger and it is half the reason I came back in the first place.  Huge thank you to the staff, servers, chefs and all others for making this a wonderful experience AGAIN!  Give you all 6 stars if it was permissible.  The meal we had in Vegas we can still taste."}
{"text":"It was my first 'Gordon Ramsay' restaurant I visited.   I was satisfied with the food but not the service...    A friend was visiting and wanted to try it so I was in!  There was still a line around 1:30.  They said it would be about 25 minutes to wait and actually only ended up being about 5 minutes.  Nice!  Our waitress was over right away for our drink orders and give us a chance to look over the menu.   There were so many unique creations and I wanted to try them all.  My friend did also so we ended up splitting two of the burgers ~ The Hog Burger with added bacon and the Euro Burger.  Of course we had to get a side of the sweet potato fries.  The fries were large enough to split so I wouldn't suggest one order for yourself.   We had ordered both burgers medium and they came out perfect!   The Hog Burger had a fabulous combinations of flavors with the bacon, pork and apple butter.  The Euro Burger topped with goat cheese and oven roasted tomato sent my taste buds into overdrive! Both were simply delicious!   Maybe it's strange to some people but I wanted ketchup for the fries.  The are served with jalapeño mayo and it just wasn't cutting it for me.  The waitress looked at me like I was nuts.  Ok but it's my weird choice.  Dessert?  Why not? We split the sticky toffee pudding push up pops.  These were just ok. I wouldn't really recommend them.  Overall I really enjoyed the burgers!  Service was just ok.   I had showed my card for the discount on our food before ordering.  When the bill came, it showed the regular prices.  I asked her about the discount.  Again, she looked at me like I was crazy and said I never showed her the total rewards card.   I just think there was a better way of saying she forgot and not blame the customer.    Yes I would go again when in the area and keep my fingers crossed for better service."}
{"text":"\" Good\" Food , not a good value. But what do you expect from Las Vegas.  Even not great food has over the top pricing. All beverages come in the same pilsner glass from milkshakes to Guinness. I will add this to a place I've been but wont go back. But sometime you just have to go to places like this . Good time had by all."}
{"text":"This burger was the best I've ever had. Almost thought about splitting it, but don't. It's just the right portion. I got the burger with the duck bacon, and garlic parm fries. Deeeelicious, and our server was really great, too. Ambiance was hip and bold. I definitely will go back there again."}
{"text":"A delicious burger. Theyre sweet potato fries and truffle garlic fries are also amazing!! The nice thing about this place is that although there was a wait when we arrived, they took my cell phone number and we were free to wander around the casino until our table was ready. We got a text right when they said we would and had a great experience."}
{"text":"I'm here to write my peace with BurGr in LV !   My second job is a bartender server as well and I understand about being slammed so when a bartender can make a connection with a customer it's a great thing...service from the lady bartender was excellent albeit quick...customers can feel a servers anxiety and she did well...i was kinda shocked at the gentlemen bar guys telling a customer sitting at the bar (after he waited for his order and requesting where it was ) : 'what do you want bro ?...all our orders are 25 minutes from the grill\" Like he was an uninformed goob....come on : the customer was simply asking where his order was...(and it turned out it was ice cream dessert....just pull from the freezer) and don't call him 'bro' cause he ain't your bro...  Asked for a certain temp in the burger and was a few notches North...ugh. Fries...cold and stale...huh ?  Hot Dog...I know there's nitrates in them but damn...! Beer list is awesome...  Too many great burgers all over Vegas to let us down Gordon....  All in all we were politely asked how it was and I never complain but the time I chose to say something...Karma hit me that eve with a touch of food poisoning or my stomach just couldnt keep this down....so to the staff at Burgr yes I understand karma is a bitch and I got mine...so Im here to make peace with BurGr and go on my way...."}
{"text":"me and 2 of my girls came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch. The awesome part of the process was they check u in and send u a txt when ur table is ready so u don't have 2 wait in line for an hour! LOVED that concept! So we walked around. . . 20mins, I received a txt that my table was ready! As soon as we sat down, we were greeted rt away by our amazing server, Alex! He was funny and friendly.  Totally made our day and experience that much better!  We ordered the euro burger, maui onion rings and the truffle fries. OH MAHHH GAHHHH. . . the burger was so juicy and delicious! So much flavor! Really liked the maui onion rings! Wasn't a big fan of the fries.   We had 2 share the burger since it was so BIG (that's what she said!)   amazing experience here! awesome wait time and process, amazing server, and delicious food! thanks for making this vegas trip UH-mazing!"}
{"text":"Will we come back?  Probably not, since there are so many other restaurants to try in L.V.   Is the restaurant worth trying?  Definitely.   (we only waited for 5-10 minutes for the table.)  How was the food?  The presentation of the food was excellent.  Food quality was good but not superb.  My chili dwag was a but disappointment for me but all the other dishes were great.  How was the service?   Good, fast service.  They have many people working together to make sure you have all the food, fill the drinks, and everything else."}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentlemen we have a winner!  The Hines' have awarded the Gordon Ramsay BurGR the winner of the best burger challenge. Yes, it's not in Southern California, but this burger has me wanting to jump on a plane at midnight for a juicy bite.   The jalapeno poppers were delish and the surprise* popper added excitement to our evening. *one jalapeno still has the seeds inside adding some mystery and  heat to dish  To be fair in our process we ordered a beef burger, cheese, grilled onions, lettuce and tomato, although the other burger options were very tempting! The burger arrived hot, and smelling amazing. The meat was cooked perfectly and when cut in half was just barely manageable to get my mouth around for a bite. Each bite was every so tasty and not one ounce of grease dripped down my arm. The bun is great and you don't end up with no meat and all bun at the end. The Just Fries were more then enough for us to split and were overshadowed by the tasty burger, but from what I remember tasted pretty good as well.  Yes, the burgers are expensive, but 1, it's Vegas and 2, it's Gordon Ramsay.  *Not sure they take reservations, but if they do, I STRONGLY suggest making one, otherwise look at a 1hr wait, minimum. I wanted to stand out front after we were done telling people the wait was worth it. But hey, if you have a wait, wander around the Miracle Mile of Shops :)"}
{"text":"Pricey but worth every penny  The burgers were delicious and the garlic truffle fries are a must."}
{"text":"I got to check this place out last week and really enjoyed it. I will say that there was a super long wait to get inside, but what would you expect? They have really good (and fresh) food at a good price, so most people opt to go here as opposed to shelling out $20 for a burger that's half as good somewhere else on the strip. The wait aside, I was thoroughly impressed with the precision and discipline with which all the employees at the restaurant operated. For a place where the average meal is about $15, you really get your moneys worth in both food and service. The staff was super friendly and attentive, food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time, and everyone was really spot on despite the massive crowd of people they had to serve. As far as the food, everything was made exactly to order, cooked perfectly, and served properly. This place far exceeded my expectation of a burger place."}
{"text":"Burger and fries were dissapointing. The fries tasted stale. You even watch as the fries sit under the lights. The burger was nothing special. You can get better at a regular restaurant for half the price. It had no sauce and sweet pickles. Not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Disappointed,its 10.00 hi,I would like  to have 2burger to go,...and the rude hostess(chaiden or I could get the name even from the managers,)  said to onother hostess... to say no, cause  tonight is busy? In svegas  its always busy,n she said no to money?did u need a special training?u are miserable and hope people whit family start boycott this kind of businness,which charge as inn burger place then  u eat ur burger cold cause  an hostess and a manager!!no kindness no money from me n all the one I know.. Count on Gordon Ramsay"}
{"text":"What a glorious concept, good 'ol burger and fries but with gourmet quality. To top it off, The drinks were well balanced. We had the Euro Burger, Gordon Burger, Fries, onion rings (our server snagged us a couple to try), mule, and a jalapeño Rita. Lots of food.."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here one day for lunch, and we were a little disappointed. First the outside design is fantastic, fire inside a window and the design of it was just so interesting.   One thing we didn't really like is that they seem to want to build up hype by creating a long line when there is no reason to. All the times we walked by (which was a lot because we were staying at Planet Hollywood) there was a long line, and the majority of the time the restaurant was basically empty and could have sat everyone in line.   As for the food it was not really the best, we both had a burger, though I don't remember which because they were both pretty bland and unimpressive. The truffle fries were really good, though at times a tad too salty.   The milkshakes were also a little different, instead of just a milkshake, they put custard on top of the milkshake, very different and I enjoyed that.   I would not recommend going here for a burger, there are a lot of other places around the strip that have better burgers."}
{"text":"The earth burger was phenomenal! The jalapeño poppers were inedible. We complained but they just laughed, saying they're \"in season\". We've had jalapeños many times before and been able to eat them without our ears burning, eyes watering and throat gagging. The peppers made the other food almost inedible. We were warned the bar was really cold but we were freezing there in our big coats. They let us move to a warmer table when it was free but still had to pay for our check at the bar....Isn't it one restaurant? Definitely obvious room for improvement."}
{"text":"I don't like waiting unless I'm absolutely sure something will be worth the wait. That being said, mosey your party of four of more up to the host stand before getting in line because then you can just put your name and number down and wander around the surrounding area. When they mean an hour wait, they really mean an hour and a half. They will text you that your table is ready, then tell you to wait as it's \"being cleaned off\" for another twenty minutes. That's annoying. That's bad service. That being said... once I got to the table and shook off my annoyance with the hosts and the poor system of communication, I was ready to indulge.   Service was very good. Since we are all jackasses who don't bring cash, we had to split the bill five ways. Our server was such a champ and broke that shit down for us without breaking a sweat. Dude got a nice tip. Legit. I appreciated that almost as much as I appreciated never having to wait for a refill.   Go big or go home: truffle burger all the way. Can't pass up the urge to get a little fancy, and you don't get fancier than a $21 burger from your favorite celebrity chef's cheapest restaurant (woe is me and my wallet). Not to fuck around any further, I also got the truffle fries for another $11. But don't worry, they were gluten-free. Wink wink.   Damn good burger. Medium cooked. Light frisee to balance out the richness of the creme fraiche and aioli. Beautiful. Every bite was worth it. The truffle fries were a hit. I am a sucker for aioli (as if that's not obvious) and this was the perfect combination with the fries. My only complaint is that the seasoning wasn't as evenly distributed as it could have been.  Tried my friend's hog burger because mangalitsa pork. And if you don't know why that's significant, shame on you. I didn't really catch the BBQ pork, the onion, the slaw, the cheddar, or the pickles; all I could taste was BACON. It was overwhelmingly porky. Delicious. But heavy. I liked mine more. Teehee. To each their own. Nothing was left on that plate.   The rest of my party of five got the blue burger, the American burger, and the uber cheese burger. Everyone was content. My friends even got some of the cocktails that they sort of push on you with their shiny iPads. I really wish I could eat more than I did, because I would've doubled up on appetizers, thrown in a fish and crisp sandwich (because YES), and chugged down a shake to follow. But alas, I still want to fit into pants, and not the stretchy Regina George kind. Until next time, BurGR!"}
{"text":"***Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a solid burger spot and a significant notch above the other celebrity chef-backed Las Vegas burger restaurant I've been to (Hubert Keller's Burger Bar in Mandalay Place)***  Burger restaurants (or maybe a sandwich spot like Earl of Sandwich) on The Strip might be your best option for a satisfying meal that does not cost you an outrageous amount of money.  A lot of the restaurants on The Strip (even the 24-hour cafes) charge a ridiculous amount of money ($30-$60) for just okay entrees.  With an upscale burger restaurant though, you are going to pay $10-$16 (maybe high but not outrageous) and get just as filling of a meal and maybe even a more satisfying one (since the total bill will not reach the fine dining-like prices of many Vegas restaurants--even casual ones).  I have not been to many of these Vegas burger spots (I hear Holsteins in The Cosmopolitan is popular).  I have been to Hubert Keller's Burger Bar, which is not too expensive but it is also not as good as it used to be.  This was my first visit to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR (located in Planet Hollywood) and it is relatively new.  The burger was good; hopefully, the quality does not go downhill as the restaurant ages.  Gordon Ramsay BurGR has a simple menu.  It ditches the build-a-burger concept (smart move since this often results in an abundance of mediocre ingredients); instead, Gordon Ramsay BurGR serves a little over 10 restaurant-designed burgers with many different types of flavors and ingredients as well as different patties (a lot of beef but also a portobello mushroom option, chicken burger and pork burger).  A few salads and typical bar and grill appetizers (like chicken wings and jalapeno poppers) are also available.  Various fries are offered in sharing size and there are also a few dessert-like shakes on the menu (that integrate cookies and puddings).  I had the chanterelle burger and it was good.  I really liked the bun.  The bun was soft, but it also had a distinct and toasted edge (so many upscale burger restaurants are putting burgers on grocery store-like buns).  The sandwich consisted of a thick eight-ounce beef patty, arugula, chanterelle mushrooms, and a sweet fig and onion jam.  The beef patty was great.  It had a good sear and a good flavor.  I ordered it medium rare and that is exactly what it was--some red in the center and very juicy.  I really liked the arugula and the sweetness of the jam was not too much.  The chanterelles were great, but there were not too many of them and this premium ingredient was kind of lost in the sandwich.  I think a good strong cheese would have made this burger better and there were parts of the burger that did feel a tad greasy.  I also tried their sticky toffee pudding push up pops for dessert.  It was a fun dessert--push up pops consisting of alternating layers of sticky toffee pudding and salted peanut ice cream.  The sticky toffee pudding layers were very thin and lacked the signature moistness and stickiness of that dessert (kind of expected given the structure of this dessert).  The sticky toffee pudding flavor was there though.  The salted peanut ice cream was creamy and not icy, but it really just tasted like vanilla ice cream.  Still, it was a fun dessert to eat.  Service was very good.  The hostesses and my server (Alex) were very friendly and attentive.  Alex was very passionate and eager to please (but in a very genuine way).  Service seemed organized and the food came out at a quick pace.  Gordon Ramsay BurGR has good lighting so that you can see what you are eating but not to the point where the restaurant is too bright.  It is a big and contemporary spot and quite loud (I am not sure about all the decorative live flames integrated into the restaurant; it is the kind of non-essential decoration that a lot of restaurants ditch later and then you are left with an odd, empty space).  Unfortunately, the restaurant sits open to the casino so depending on where you are sitting, the cigarette smoke from the gaming floor might be very disruptive to your dining experience.  Prices are good.  Burgers are in the $13-$16 range, but they are very filling and the flavors and preparation of the burgers are much better than a mediocre $40 steak at one of those 24-hour cafes on The Strip.  Total Rewards members also receive $1 off most items on the menu.  Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a great and not too expensive option for a satisfying and unique (but also not bank breaking) lunch or dinner on The Strip.  Hopefully, it does not fall into the trap of other celebrity chef-backed restaurants on The Strip where the quality standards drop as time goes on.  I have never parked here, but I imagine Planet Hollywood offers free self and valet parking like all the other major hotels and casinos on The Strip."}
{"text":"Food quality was very good.  Service was friendly.  Comfortable seating for our group of 9 which included five kids.  Prices about expected for the type of restaurant.  Onion rings and sweet potato fries were very good!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong about this place - everything they do is top-notch as far as effort, presentation and execution.  Their truffle fries are great, and the truffle aioli and ketchup they serve with it are equally amazing.  Their jalapeno poppers are so good.  They don't wimp out, and the game of \"Who gets the one with the seeds?\" is a fun thing for the table to play.    So why 3 stars and not 4 or 5?  Well...the drinks were blah, for one.  But for two, the burgers themselves were just okay.  Not amazing.  Not life-changing.  Not incredible.  They were just ok.    We got the chanterelle burger and their signature pork burger.  Both buns were sort of just there, and I'm not sure that a seeded bun worked with their burgers in either instance.  The chanterelles weren't particularly plentiful and lost a little too much texture.  And the beef in the chanterelle burger and the pork in the other just weren't flavorful enough, pronounced enough or dominant enough to be anything more than just ok.  Honestly, even though it's a far more simple burger, Bobby's Burger Palace across the street had a better burger.  Hell even Stripburger down by the Wynn had a better burger.  Not nearly as cool or fun of a presentation, but definitely a better burger."}
{"text":"LOVE This place.  As a conisuer of burgers this is at the top of my list.  The service was good,  can be a while upon getting food.  The drinks were awesom, and the food had me savoring every bite.  I shared a burger,truffle fries, and vear batter onion rings which were Amazin!!;as well as the sauce for fries.  It should ve bottles if ot already isnt.  Im just saying.  I would recommend this for those looking for a hearty vurger,beer or spe ialtu drink with fries."}
{"text":"A wonderful variety of burger choices.  I got the blue cheese burger.  It was delicious and cooked to my liking.  $14 for a burger (no sides) is pricey, but we were going because it is Gordon Ramsey's restaurant and knew ahead of time it wasn't going to be cheap.  The truffle fries were very good!  I tasted my friend's sweet potato fries and they were to die for!!!  Over all we had a very good experience!  Also, we had a party of 10 and the staff were very accommodating trying hard to get us in sooner rather than later.  Very grateful for their service!"}
{"text":"Love Burgr. I find service hit or miss here, but then again it does it insanely busy at times so that really can't be helped. I always order the American and we share a fires and find that more than enough for dinner. Portion sizes are decent and delicious and definitely worth the wait outside to get in! We go whenever we are in Vegas. It's just that good! :)"}
{"text":"First time here and the hamburger (hells Kitchen) and truffle fries were on point. If you're in the mood for a hamburger I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Last day in Vegas. Staying at the Flamingo, and hubby had a hankerin' for a burger. We asked a server at the pool, and she recommended BurGR. A nice short walk to Planet Hollywood, and BurGR was right at the entry near Cabo Wabo Cantina. Walked right in and was seated right away.   Husband ordered the American, I ordered the Hot and Spicy, which had tomato, jalapeños, and avocado, with a sesame seed bun. It was absolutely delicious. The flavor was so bold, the burger so juicy, the cheese and avocado, so nicely paired. We shared the original fries, with a side of avocado ranch for dipping. We ate every last bite!! The service was prompt, the lighting was a little dark, and I felt like we were sitting a little close to our neighbors, but I understand being in a casino hotel, that's the way it is. Nice beer selection, which was presented on an IPad. Interesting way to display the drink menu, but it was fine by me. The meal was affordable, about $55 for 2 burgers, 2 tall drafts, and a fry.   This was the best meal I had in 3 days in Vegas. If you want a delicious burger, and aren't turned off by celebrity owned restaurants, check this place out!  YUM"}
{"text":"Much like Gordon Ramsay's personality, Burgr is terrible.  I thought, maybe he gets away with being an A-hole because he is a fantastic chef.  Nope, nope, nope.  Let me tell you about these pre-made, previously frozen patties.  Dry, flavorless, and overpriced.  Another case of a restaurant surviving on location alone.  The decor is pretty awesome.  Nice, new, sleek, and modern.  I can see the appeal to stop-in, if walking by.  I'm still in disbelief that this restaurant is putting out such low quality burgers."}
{"text":"First time here and service was on point. Food was amazing . Also was able to me the chef himself . That was a plus unexpected!"}
{"text":"First time eating at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and I was not disappointed. I have seen his shows on Hell's Kitchen, Masterchef, Masterchef Junior, The F Word, Gordon's Great Escape, and I was looking forward so much to this meal.   I expected a long wait when we got there and we were told about 30-40 minutes but surprisingly, we got in at around 25 minutes. A very pleasant surprise!  The service was fantastic and we had lots of assistance when we had questions about the menu. For starters, me and my mates got the onion rings, jalapeno poppers, and the fury chicken wings. The chicken wings were tender but a bit spicy for me. I can't really take spicy foods so if you're like me, don't get it! The onion rings were fried nice and golden, but other than that they weren't too special. We also ordered some truffle Parmesan fries which were nice but again, nothing too unique. The jalapeno poppers, however, were amazing. I was afraid they would be too spicy but they weren't. As I bit into it, a burst of golden magic rain exploded in my mouth and the flavors of cheese, herbs, jalapeno, all swirled together and started dancing on my tongue. It was a symphony of flavors and the perfect amount of spice. I was actually speechless.   For the main course, after much decision I decided to go with something different and went with the Hog Burger. I haven't had burger made from pork before and it was so juicy, tender, and full of smokiness of the rich pork flavor. The cheddar cheese added a lovely flavor to it and the apple butter and arugula added some awesome smooth and crunchy texture as well. The burger was big and each bite was so filled with flavor, it was like each bite was better than the previous. This really was the top 5 burgers in my life.   Of course, I wasn't going to leave without a dessert. I ordered Shake #1 because there must be a reason why it was #1. The chocolate shake combined with the caramel pudding was served at a perfect temperature, and was deliciously succulent and rich, and a perfect duo between caramel and chocolate. It was so smooth it nearly melted and dissolved into my tongue. It was topped off with a toffee cookie which was nice as it provided some crunch to the smoothness and eating them together worked. I think with a drink like this, it's easy to make it overpoweringly sweet. However, this was the perfect amount of sweetness.  TL;DR - Jalapeno Poppers, Hog Burger, Shake #1 are to die for."}
{"text":"Truffle Fries for the Win.   Do you know what it feels like to hit a jackpot in Vegas?  Try them and you will know.    Burgers are great as well.  Burgers will feel like you won a hand and the fries will feel like you hit a jackpot."}
{"text":"70 min. wait on a Friday night for you lineup lovers!  No rezs.  If you want to pay $25.00 for a burger, with no fries, then this is the place for you.  I had the pig burger and asked for it well done, it came out PINK and because we hardly saw our server, I was not able to re-order.  The cocktails are good though.  GR you might want to do some QC on this one."}
{"text":"Here for lunch.Love me some Gordon...but 45 minute wait for a burger and fries??? Ok fries were good...came with two fancy ketchups not to our liking so we asked for regular ketchup.We ordered the farm fresh or farmhouse burger.Between the two of us we had 10 big hunks of hard gristle.while I went to the restroom my husband complained to the waitress who brought over the manager who apologized. He took the food off the bill.my husband explained that we weren't looking for a freebie but just wanted to let them know that the quality of the beef left much to be desired.We still tipped the waitress well.its nit her fault.Gordon should be ashamed of himself for being a trillionaire and charging such high prices for low quality food and for making his waitresses wear skirts that barely cover their chas chas."}
{"text":"Wish I didn't have to eat and run!  Came here while waiting for a poker tournament to start.  Took awhile to get seated and to get our burger (the place is popular), but it was worth it!    The burger (American) was excellent, cooked as perfect as I've ever seen, and absolutely delicious.  The regular fries were too dry, though, and were honestly making my jaw sore from all the chewing.  If I didn't have to rush out due to the tournament I would have tried one of their awesome looking shakes.   Will definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Solid burger!  Let's start off with this place is super popular! We've come by before & the wait was over an hour long so we of course skipped it. This place also doesn't take reservations. I really hate that. Please someone wake up and get reservations going. This is possibly the most annoying bad decision for any restaurant, especially on the strip. This time we decided to go very early around 6pm to have dinner and it wasn't bad with about a 20 min wait. There were 3 hostesses and not one of them could crack a smile. Get new hostesses.   Luckily when inside we got Aubrey who served us and she was awesome! I'm giving her a shout out because she was cute, sweet & funny. We started with the Maui onion rings that could have been really great but the batter on them was cracked on nearly every piece of onion & a tad over fried. The sweet onion flavor was really great but the batter lost us. Then came the sweet potato fries that again could have been great and the few that were on the very top were but the moment you got deeper it was a pile of mush. Don't put fries in a narrow container of stainless steel so they can mush up from the heat, gross. And now to the simple American burger that had all the right notes. The meat was tender & seasoned perfectly, the bun was soft, the paper thin red onions were awesome, the paper thin pickles rocked, and the tender tomato was off the charts. I loved this burger!   The service was great. The environment is fun & loud. A few changes are definitely needed but they are easy ones. Great job on the burger! I would definitely go back and try a different burger and one last note - there weren't any burger sliders on the menu? Burger places should have burger sliders. I recommend a slider sampler."}
{"text":"When you're bouncing around Planet Hollywood, ever wonder what those crazy people in that insane long line are waiting for? Well, I'll tell you - they're all hungry patrons wanting to get a taste of Gordon Ramsay's Burgers.   Here's my advice. If you are a party larger than 2 go up to the counter a few hours before you want to eat and put your name down with the hostess. She will call or text you in about 1 hour-2 hours for your party's reservation. We saw a lot of angry people who went off to the casino to wait and missed their alert reservation. Luckily, there was only two of us so we got to wait in the line.   Don't go there if you're starving because you may be in line for at least 30 minutes. When we were finally seated, we got down to business. I ordered the Farm Burger (thanks yelp) and the hubby got the Chanterelle Burger (w/ figgy onion jam) with a side of truffle fries.  Now if you're not already sick of all the fried food in vegas, you must try the truffle fries. They just have such a unique flavor and are done to perfection. Order one basket to share and you'll be good.  I'm not usually a burger gal but my Farm burger was amazing. The meat makes the most difference in a burger, it was not too overdone and had very good flavor. I tried my husband's Chanterelle burger but the figgy onion jam, which makes it sweet, just turned me off.  Service was kind of hit or miss since they're super busy even at 9 PM at night.   BurGR is not an absolute must hit for Sin City but if you are in PH and can stand the long wait - go there."}
{"text":"This restaurant was our favorite in Vegas, we ate there twice.  The menu is a unique twist to classic American comfort food.  Everything tasted fresh.  We tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger (perfect blend of ingredients, spice level, and texture), the pork sandwich (large and flavorful), Maui onion rings (best onion rings I've had, dipping sauces were great), regular fries (thick cut, overly salted, served with fantastic homemade ketchup), and the wings (sweet and spicy, well presented).  The service varied.  The first time we were there, we sat at a high top and our server was friendly, attentive, and laid back in a good way.  He checked in regularly.  The second visit we were seated at the table right next to where the servers punch in their orders and keep the water pitchers.  We always had someone zooming inches from the table or standing next to it which seemed distracting.  Both times there was a line outside the door with about a 30 minute wait however there were many empty tables inside, not being filled.  I'm not sure if the line is for image or if they aren't staffed enough to manage the amount of tables they have in the dinning areas.  Regardless, the wait is worth it."}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Service was great! Sticky toffee pudding is the bees knees! If you're looking for a good meal come to Gordon Ramsey's!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 different times and the place never disappointments in terms of a great burger. My favorites are either the chanterelle or the hog burger with \"just fries\". The fries come up two different ketchup: curry and chipotle. Wash it down with a Sierra pale ale and I'm good to go.   Beware of very long lines at night during weekend so I recommend just grabbing a seat at the bar rather than waiting for a table if you are on the run to catch a show."}
{"text":"5-star for a burger place. It's one of those spots where you always see a line. But by the time you have your first bite, you know it's worth the wait. The roasted jalapeño popper was  amazing. The spiciness pairs perfectly with the crunchy breading. The moment when all the flavors explode in your mouth is enough to make one's day. Burgers are exceptionally tasty and juicy. The melted cheese curdling up all over the patty turned me on!!"}
{"text":"My husband had to work so I went on my own.  Sat at the bar, and was happy the bartenders were friendly.  I asked what cider they had on tap and was given an option of pear, and apple (angry orchard).  Thank you to Raul who was pleasant, amiable, and knowledgeable.  I enjoyed my Hell's Kitchen burger.  The cheese was delicious, and the jalapano was very tasty.  I did have an issue with the jalapeno size.  It was left whole (butterflied) and when I took the first bite if my burger I pulled the entire pepper out.  As a side note, the fries are DEFINITELY a share-between-two-people size.  Possibly three."}
{"text":"Service was great, the burgers I tried (farm Burger, hells kitchen) weren't anything special I was told this would be the best Burger I've had and didn't quite meet expectations."}
{"text":"Went to Burgr for dinner last night. We had a party of 3 and the wait time was said to be 30 min. They took our name and number down on their iPad & were told we would receive a text. The system went down and they lost our name so we ended up waiting for over an hour.   Once we were seated we ordered the chicken sliders as an appetizer. It comes with 2. They were the perfect size but we should've ordered another because it took a while to get our entree. We ordered the sabo chicken salad which was a cold and slightly spicy chicken salad. Very good!!   We also got the Hell's Kitchen burger and the damnation chicken sandwich. Both were phenomenal! The meat was cooked perfectly. The chicken was like a meatball type patty. I don't like blue cheese so I had them remove the dressing however it needed some type of sauce. I ended up asking for chipotle ketchup which made it very tasty!   We also ordered the sweet potato and Parmesan fries. OMG best sweet potatoes ever. They give you powdered sugar on them and on the side so you can add as much as you please. All fries come with their own dipping sauces, we asked for one of each.   Everything was excellent! Perfect portions so you'll have room for dessert."}
{"text":"Awesome burger! The prices are well worth it! Fresh and delicious. I ordered the blue cheese burger and it was to die for. The truffle fries are also delicious and will feed up to 4 people. We also ordered the pork belly steamed buns and OMG! Must try this place and will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I commend Gordan Ramsay for his work, but in all honesty this place was alright. The fire/sign decoration, creative menu design, and the I-Pad drink menu was all impressive but the food itself was not as savory as I would expect.   We ordered the jalapeno poppers, truffle parmesan fries, and the Farm burger. The Jalapeno poppers were yummy and came with this spicy ranch sauce. FYI, they include a \"surprise\" jalapeno popper which is basically a super spicy one that creeps up on you. Haha. The fries were hearty, but it definitely wasn't the best fries I've had. The duck burger itself had all the right ingredients but for some reason it just wasn't as savory as I was hoping for. If anything, I think it was the burger meat - all the add ons and condiments saved this burger.   The sticky toffee pudding push pops were a good ending to the meal, yet had an icy/frost-bitten consistency to it. I could understand someone that's not into sticky toffee pudding being turned off by these.   There is a wait, but they do give you the option of giving your phone number and they'll text you when your table is ready.  All in all, it was a good experience but definitely not my favorite burger joint."}
{"text":"No thanks. I came here because of the Yelp reviews but this was a rare occasion where they led me wrong. The atmosphere was bizarre and contrived. The iPad they give you to order drinks on was weird. The service was OK but the busser was really rude and I didn't eat my left overs because I was scared he may have tampered with them."}
{"text":"The service at this establishment is absolutely horrible. We were celebrating my daughter's b'day last night and decided to try BurGR. We get there and stand in a very long line, which was no big deal and sort of expected it. While standing in line a hostess comes up to us and asks how many in our party, we say 5. She takes us out of line and places our party size and cell phone number in an iPad and tells us that we will receive a text message as soon as our table is ready, which would probably be about an hour, to an hour and 20 minutes, this was at 8:05 pm. Fine. We proceed to the Extra Lounge and have a few drinks and listen to a very good live band. Well and hour and 20 minutes comes and goes so my brother decides to go and ask the hostess what's going on. She tells us we will be getting the next booth and if we don't receive a text by 9:37 pm to come back. It's now 9:45 pm and no text so my brother goes back to the hostess. I notice he's gone for about 5 minutes so we get up to go and see what the problem is. I find him talking to a manager, Benjamin is his name. I hear my brother, in a very neutral tone asking him if he could at least apologize and own up to the fact that we have been stood up. Apparently the hostess never entered our reservation correctly in the iPad so it was as if we never had our info in the system and my brother was trying to rectify the situation and asked the manager to at least own up to the fact that someone on his staff made a mistake. My brother explained to Benjamin the manager that he too is a Customer Service manager and when things like this happen you apologize and try to fix the situation. Again, my brother never raised his voice and I hear Benjamin telling my brother \"dude lower your voice do not yell at me.\" Seriously, a \"manager\" addresses his customers with the word \"dude?\" My brother kept saying to him, \"I am not yelling at you, I am explaining how good customer service should work.\" Again, Benjamin tells my brother \"dude lower your voice and don't take that tone with me.\" So I ask my brother \"what's going on?\" and he proceeds to tell me that Benjamin isn't quite getting the picture of what good customer service should entail and that at this point he is being an asshole. Yes my brother used that word and maybe it was wrong but he said it to me and not directly to Benjamin and only out of frustration because it was my daughter's b'day and she really wanted to eat at BurGR.  At that point Benjamin says that he is not going to seat us because my brother called him a derogatory name. Mind you, all my brother wanted at that point was an apology that his staff messed up and for him to own it. Benjamin refused and continued calling my brother \"dude\" and telling him that he wasn't going to seat us even though we waited over an hour and 50 minutes. I don't know about anyone else but in my book that is truly bad customer service. At this point my husband is standing there livid and tells Benjamin that he's a f***ing dickhead and a poor manager. And Benjamin stands there with a huge smile on his face and says to my husband \"have a great night, you're not eating at BurGR\" which infuriated him even more, I honestly had to pull my husband away because I knew if we stayed there 1 more minute Benjamin would have found himself passed out on the floor with all his teeth missing.  Needless to say we will never go back to BurGR and every chance I get, on every social network possible, I am going to let everyone know how terrible the service is and what a moron Gordon Ramsay has as a manager for that restaurant. I don't know why Benjamin got so offended over a comment that wasn't made directly to him because from what I know about Gordon Ramsay, he goes around calling his staff members much worse. The good news is we ended up at Stripburger and had the best service and best burgers ever. Piss off BurGR!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this  3.5 stars if I could.    Atmosphere - It was nice and gave it a little fun tone to it.  Food - I got the farm burger which was decent.  The patty was a little salty so I was  little disappointed.  The truffle fries were AMAZZZING!!   Service - Our waiter was attentive and had great suggestions on the menu.  Maybe I had high hopes for the burger and I'm being a bit harsh but I'll be back to give   a second try in case it was a bad night for patties."}
{"text":"Wait: A group of us came at around 5pm and had a 20 minute wait. It wasn't bad at all because they call you when your table is ready so you can walk around while you wait. We actually got a Fat Tuesday close by and that itself took 20 minutes.  Food: Delicious!! I got to try their Chanterelle burger (with fig jam?) and Farm burger (with duck breast bacon). I also had some of their banana milkshake with butterscotch pudding on top. That was amazing but it got too sweet to finish the last few bites. Last but not least, their fries!!! I tried the sweet potato fries with powdered sugar and truffle fries with aioli sauce. EVERYTHING WAS SO DELICIOUS. Come with a group of friends so you can try a little bit of everything.  Service: I deducted 1 star because the waitress was not very attentive and we waited a while until she came to give us the bill.   If it wasn't for the ok service, I would give this place a 5 star. The food was amazing and the prices were very reasonable (for a sit down Vegas restaurant). I highly recommend Burgr!!"}
{"text":"A-OK.  Three stars really isn't bad when you look at it that way, but it just looks bad compared to 4-5 stars.    But Burgr to me just isn't one of those PLACES.  It was good, but it's hard to justify a $15 burger no matter where I am.  That better have organic, grass-fed beef and all other organic ingredients and I don't think Burgr does because they'd probably advertise it if they did.  It was a short wait, service was good, the food was good and the truffle fries were good.  The portion sizes are plentiful.  Honestly, two people could probably share a burger and fries, but I know some people like to get stuffed.  Bottom line: the food is good.  If you want to spend $15 for a burger, go for it.  I think you could get a similar tasting burger for less.  Earl of Sandwich is somewhere I have to go when I go to Vegas.  Same with Fat Tuesday.  The trip wouldn't be complete without going to those places.  Burgr isn't like that for me."}
{"text":"I reaaaaally wanted to give this place five stars...  Because the food was ON POINT!!! I ordered the turkey burger with avocado and my hubby ordered a regular cheese burger. Of course we had to try the Parmesan fried as well. FOOD WAS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never ever had a better tasting burger in my whole life. And I've been to a looot of burger places. The buns have toasted black & white sesame seeds which I really like. My burger had tiny shoestring fried in it which I also really enjoy. Both burgers were bursting with flavor!!!! Fries were a little salty and the ketchup was waaaay too salty but tasted well meshed with the aioli sauce.  The one & only bad thing that is keeping me from giving them the 5 stars they deserve, was that the food took just over 45 minutes from the time we ordered to the time it arrived at our table. And it wasn't insanely crowded because we only had to wait five minutes in line. In fact I even got 5 refills of iced tea before my food had even arrived. I don't know what took the food so long but I really wish it didn't because I REALLY like this place!!!! And normally if it's just me it wouldn't be a problem at all, but having to entertain a year & a half old toddler for over 45 minutes is not easy at all.  So please please give this place a shot if you have time to spare and enjoy some bomb burgers!!!"}
{"text":"I came to Gordon Ramsay's BurGr for lunch. I have never been to one of his restaurants, but I watch Hell's Kitchen and I had high expectations! This restaurant is casual with a trendy chic flair, hints of fire and orange made me hungry after just entering the restaurant. The burgers were delicious. Our table had the American Burger, the Uber Cheese Burger and the Hell's Kitchen Burger. I tried a bite of them all and the Hell's Kitchen was my favorite, but all were delightful to the taste buds. They were $15, but you will dream about these burgers later! So worth it! Our table ordered two sides of Parmesan fries, which were mouth watering delectable, but one order would have fed our table of three. This was an extra price of $11 each. My friend ordered a plain chocolate shake and was impressed by the taste and consistency. My husband ordered the Chocolate Hazelnut Pudding Coffee Shake with Praline Cookie. The cookie was just okay, the Coffee Shake was sweet and tasty, but the chocolate hazelnut pudding on the top was way too thick to enjoy in a drink. The shakes were $9 each, I thought overall they were pretty reasonable. I ordered the skinny lemonade off the drink menu and I didn't really like it, there was a lemon seltzer flavor and it wasn't very sweet... I prefer the sweet drinks. Our waitress recommended the other skinny drink, it was like a sweet tangerine mojito, I can not remember the exact name of the drink, but there are only two skinny drinks on the menu. If you are in the mood for a burger done right, you have to go here, you will be pleased you did"}
{"text":"The American cheeseburger is amazing! My expectations were high in this first visit and i wanted to try the basic cheeseburger. I'm really surprised that it was even better than my expectation. One tip: add truffle aioli as a side."}
{"text":"Anytime I eat a burger, it's always just... Something to eat, and I never finish the whole thing or I get bored of the burger. But this burger... The Chanterelle Burger.  Wow. Never have I been so eager to finish the whole thing. Got mine medium rare and it has arugula, and Chanterelle mushrooms in a fig onion jam. The sweetness of the jam along with the light herbal spice from the arugula really came together.  I couldn't get enough.   My bf got the hells kitchen burger. It was well put together, but I didn't think the flavors really melded like the Chanterelle burger. The spiciness killed any subtle flavors present.   We decided to also get the truffle fries. Cheese on the side. The truffle aioli was really good. If I go back, I may or may not get them again. We only finished half the serving before getting too full.   I would definitely come back for that Chanterelle burger. They've got me hooked!"}
{"text":"Matt the waiter is bomb.com! Omm hands down the best burgers in town. The sticky toffee pudding pops are amazing and so are the milkshakes. Omg the hummus app and the TRUFFLE FRENCH FRIES! I've even had the jalapeño poppers so good."}
{"text":"My burger was salty and chared - I ordered medium. My soda was flat and they had no means of replacing it with something that wasn't.   The service was mediocre and it was very loud."}
{"text":"The TV show is nuts. You always hear Gordon yelling his lungs off, but when you eat the food.......words can't describe the awesomeness of it. The hell kitchen burger is out of this world. I swear I seen a cow get slaughtered for my taste buds.  The fries are dope. The people are awesome. The price I say is very fair for the quality your eating! Ladies and gents more to come!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the service was even better! Thank you Guy and Kurtis you were amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome burger joint in planet hollywood. We had the hells kitchen and euro burgers, which were fantastic! Must get the truffle fries...I recommend at most two people per order :) Their toffee push pop was a little too sweet & rich for my personal taste...left me feeling extremely heavy after the heavy meal. Also great selection of beers on tap!"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend after a long day at the Grand Canyon, and was quite looking forward to the meal as Gordon Ramsay is my favourite celebrity chef. There was a fair bit of a line when we got there (around 9:15pm) but we were in and seated in about 10 minutes. Our waitress promptly came over and gave us an ipad to browse drinks and took our orders shortly after.  I ordered the truffle burger and my girlfriend ordered the hell's kitchen burger, without the japalenos. We both got the burgers medium, and added a side of truffle fries and a salad. I also got a beer. The salad came out quickly, but even before we were done, the burgers were on the table, followed by the fries. The timing was a bit off, as we had a fairly small table and the table became cramped. The waitress also forgot my beer but after reminding her, she went and got it.   The salad was very average and had an insane amount of croutons (kale apple caesar salad). The truffle fries were delicious, and a very large serving. The two dips it came with were fantastic, a curry aioli and a home made ketchup. Now for the burgers: my girlfriend said that her burger was the best she'd ever had, and after a bit of it, I agreed that it was incredibly juicy and flavourful, and indeed a fantastic burger. My truffle burger also had a lot of flavour, but was a tad dry. I'm not sure if this is because of the toppings in the burger, but it was noticeably drier than my girlfriend's. Nonetheless, still delicious.  We were seated in front of the kitchen and I got to watch the kitchen operate and move around, which is always a bonus for me. I love watching open kitchens.   All in all, the burgers were good and the service was average. For what we paid, I felt it was a tad expensive, but maybe that's because I ordered the most expensive burger on the menu.  This is a 3.5 star rating."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but it was such a solid spot, I would consider coming back when I'm in Vegas. For our party of 5, there was a very very short wait. As a table, we ordered the truffle fries and the gooey fries since the burgers didn't come with sides of fries. I ordered the farm burger because I'm a sucker for a fried egg. The wait for the burger was roughly 30 min so when the food came, I ate it so fast. Probably why I got so full so fast. The gooey fries were extremely filling but oh-so yummy. So much cheese hngggg. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium-well, as requested. If you're unsure where to go while on the strip, this place wouldn't be a bad consideration. Pretty good food, so-so service, and it was pricy, but not more than I would expect for a restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"Delicious, one of the best burgers I've ever had! We waited about 10 minutes around lunch time and the service was friendly and efficient. We have the jalapeño poppers which were spicy but addicting. The burgers are cooked perfectly to your likely and extremely juicy. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"After watching Britney's: Piece of Me, we dined our way at Mr. Gordon Ramsay's BurGR.  A placed I've been wanting to try in a long time.  So lets get this post-Britney party started...  The GR Dining layout:  Tables spread apart everywhere with a mixture of booths.  It seemed clean and enough ample elbow space.  Our table was clean and I was ready to grub.  The GR Appetizers:   ~ We started with the Roasted Jalapeño Poppers ($12):  Six little poppers with one fiery surprise!  Now this wasn't your ordinary bite-sized snack, these were large breaded jalapenos sitting in a saucy shot glass.  Loved'em!  Pretty darn hot too!  Crunchy on the outside, soft and cheesy flavorful on the inside.   ~ Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11):  Real parmesan, and sprinkled truffle salt sitting on top of hand-cut truffle fries ... mmm, mmm, mmm!!!  Double fried crispy, and soft in the middle; THE BEST!!!  Oh wait, and it comes with a truffle aïoli, whaaat!!!  Talk about a truffle lover heaven!  The BurGRs: ~ Uber Cheese Burger ($15):  Holy orgasm!  How can you not love a burger made over and open flame.  And you can smell the woody smokiness!  Even after all the drinking and dancing.  This burger made me wanna scream and shout, and let it all out!   ~ Euro Burger ($16):  Another truffle-lover favorite.  The aïoli and goat cheese, with the roasted tomato.  WOW, what a combo!   ~ You can tell the patty meat was of good quality.  Juicy with every bite!  Even the sesame bun was soft and erotic.  I only wish I could try every burger. ~ Although I didn't try them, my other friends enjoyed eating the Farm burger and American burger as well.    To end the night: ~ We had the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops ($7):  Definitely fun and just OK in my opinion!  Should've gone with the shake instead.    Service:  Excellent from beginning to end.  Water glass filled without asking.  Thanks Christian, you've really won my girl's heart, lol.  Overall:  It was all simply worth it!"}
{"text":"First time here; definitely, can't go wrong with anything you order. Our group made a reservation hours prior and we still waited another 30 after our given time... But wasn't a big deal since the line was longer.   Ordered the truffle burger with the gooey fries... Wow. It was the perfect size for one person. A buddy ordered the jalapeño poppers they had some heat and one of the 8 have pure seeds.. Careful.   Great experience for a well deserved food coma."}
{"text":"My burger patty came out well-done despite ordering it medium. The patty was burnt as well and very dry, and made my Euro Burger taste like it was overcooked by an amateur at a backyard BBQ. It was the type of patty Gordon Ramsay would go apesh*t over, like, 1st week of Hell's Kitchen level of rage. It was so well-done I could have worn it as leather. It was so burnt that this cow's offspring shed a tear that this patty went to waste. However, the sesame bun, goat cheese, arugula, and the baked tomato in the burger was tasty. But the star of the burger, the patty, was not what I had anticipated. It was definitely not even close to one of the best burgers I've ever had.   For the big name of this restaurant and the heavenly level of dining quality of Gordon Ramsay, this was a big let down. I can't help but think that this is a totally different burger place than was featured on MasterChef."}
{"text":"Absolutly amazing!!!  We went during the 4th of July weekend and were blown away with how good it was.  My fiance had the Euro Burger and I had the Farm Burger...both were fantastic.  We also had the Truffle Fries and the Sweet Potatoe Fries and both were outstanding!!  Service was incredible...had to wait about 30 min in line but it was well worth it.  Cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever tasted and that includes shake shack burger! Just love the tasty, juicy, non-greasy patty they use. Love it!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. I was finally able to go there while I was in town for a conference. We started the experience off by ordering drinks, they have this lemonade like drink that is very good. We ordered the piggies in blankets appetizer, it's pork belly wrapped in dough. It was amazing, I highly recommend although it is $14 for only 8 pieces. I ordered the American burger and truffle fries. The burger was perfectly seasoned and didn't need any condiments. The truffle fries are amazing, big enough to be shared between 2 people. It is a bit expensive but definitely worth the visit if you can make it. I definitely will be going back..."}
{"text":"Always busy and always a line.  But well worth the wait. I love the fire lighting in the entrance and the burgers were just off the charts.  Not you average burger for sure."}
{"text":"Great stop for lunch!!! Our waiter was friendly, brought out the food warm, and well done! I was very impressed. The prices were good too!"}
{"text":"The burgers are AMAZING!!! Their shakes are AMAZING!!! Need I say more...if u haven't tried this place then u need to make a stop there ur next trip to Las Vegas. It's pricey but u get what u pay for AMAZING food!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely long waits without a reservation.. Had a vegeterian burger (don't quite remb the name) but it was definitely not worth the wait and the price!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. I ordered the \"hells burger\" and my boyfriend ordered the \"farm burger\"  it's loud and really busy in there. Customer service was excellent. To me the food did seem over priced. Our tab was $75 for 2 burgers, a side off fries, a salad and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"It took abbot of time to be seated and to get our food but please don't let that keep you away. Everything from the sweet potato fries and ketchup to  my Hell's Kitchen burger or my wife's blue burger....they know what they doing. I would say don't miss it if you want a burger in vegas!"}
{"text":"friday lunch wait was not bad. about 15 minutes. the servers and hostess were all nice. we ordered the euro burger the chanterelle burger and the wings. the wings were good. it was an order of 10 i believe. the were regular buffalo wings but not spicy at all. the burgers were not bad. the euro burger had goat cheese and the chanterelle has an onion fig jam i believe it was all good. BUT not woth the price. it was about 60 for all that. its not bad though."}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. Waiters were full of attitude and everything is overpriced!!! First we order, they miss an Item, then they bring our food it's completely different than what we ordered. We asked for ketchup our waiter lagged so much that our food turned cold.  Honestly I have had better burgers. In-n-outs cheeseburger tastes 10x better than this place. Save money and time (the wait is ridiculously long) and go somewhere else where you can actually enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Wanted to try my first Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  The service was excellent, but the food was just good, not mind blowing.  But I will say presentation on everything was excellent.  We ordered: Fury chicken wings - came out very fast, tasted pretty good. Farm burger - didn't really taste the wood fire grilled patty.  The egg was perfectly fried, and I mean perfectly. Kale Granny-Apple Caesar Salad - this is the only item that we tried that I would order again.  It was that good. chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake+ praline cookie - was good, not bad  Most of the items were good, not bad, not great.  Presentation was excellent, service was excellent.  I don't come to Vegas often so I probably won't come back (I want to try some of the other restaurants) but I would be happy to come back for that awesome salad and excellent service one day."}
{"text":"Love the line cuts when you are a Diamond member with the casino.  Otherwise, you will have to stand and wait in a tortuous line.  Located inside Planet Hollywood.  Servers are nice, albeit their attire is not super tasteful.  Guys shirts are too tight, the buttons are literally holding on for dear life and the girls dresses don't leave much up to the imagination.  Although, we shouldn't be imagining much because this is a restaurant and not a trashy strip club... right?  Onto the food: - Truffle fries - delicious, they are cut thick and come out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - Jalapeno poppers - they arrive upright on a stand with individual shot cup dippers.  Each popper is filled with cheddar bacon.  Be careful, one of them has all of the seeds!  - Sliders - literally 2 so that it can earn that plural S on the end.  They were okay... save your stomach for the real burgers - Onion Rings - probably some of the best I've had in quite some time.  Now the burgers... recommend you order a few and cut em up to share: - Chanterelle Burger - with chanterelle mushrooms, arugula and a sweet figgy-onion jam. Phenomenal. - Hell's Kitchen Burger - with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado and oven roasted tomato.  This one was bland and boring in comparison to the Chanterelle.  Being that it earned the title of \"Hell's Kitchen\" I was expecting more fire... more oomph, but turns out it was just a typical boring burger with a fancy avocado.  Much like a dolled up girl in a tight dress with the personality of a rock.  Welcome to Vegas, y'all!"}
{"text":"Things went pretty well. They quoted us 25 min wait, we probably waited 15 at max. Our server Tammy was super sweet and attentive. My bf loved his hell's kitchen burger and my farm burger was not bad either."}
{"text":"Great service! Food was also g. We had a party of 7 and everything was quick and delicious. The sweet potato fries were different and soooo yummy! I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and my husband had the Gordon burger. Wait wasn't too bad for this busy area. Also a must try..the pork buns!!"}
{"text":"Literally the best burger I've had in my entire life. Only downside to eating here is the super long wait! We went on a Sunday and it was packed all day. Waited 45 minutes for a table but it was worth the wait. Got the Euro Burger which was a Gordon Ramsay burger with goats cheese, arugula, truffle aioli and roasted tomatoes. So freakin good! You should eat here if you're in the area or you're missing out."}
{"text":"The food was great! We had the chicken burger, the euro burger and the truffle Parmesan fries. DELICIOUS!!!! The only reason why we didn't give it a 5 star rating is because the wait for the food was very long!"}
{"text":"Since watching Kitchen Nightmares, I've been wanting to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Well, BurGR was my first and probably last.  To start, the service here was a bit cold. Probably because I was dining alone and preferred to sit at a table over the bar. My restaurant star ratings are rarely based on service though, unless it's exceptionally terrible, so let's move on.  I ordered a Hell's Kitchen burger with Parmesan truffle fries. The burger was cooked to perfection, just as I ordered it; medium rare. The meat itself sort of lacked flavor, but the jalapeños, tomatoes, bun and avocado made up for it. The fries were great. They're cut thick and come with two dipping sauces. Ketchup, which tasted better than a lot of other ketchups for some reason, and a white (mayo based?) sauce. One portion would probably be enough for two people.   So why the two star rating? For one, my burger was cold. After my first bite, I figured maybe it was only cold on the outer edge of the patty, but that wasn't the case. Then I thought maybe the toppings cooled it down, but the entire burger was pretty much room temperature. Also, I noticed a disgusting looking hair caked onto my fries halfway through them.   It's a shame, because this place went from a definite four (potentially five) star rating to a two within minutes. Had my burger at least been hot, even warm, I'd have looked beyond the hair and rated this place higher. My experience, however, to quote Gordon in a recent episode, had quickly become \"dreadful.\" Perhaps Gordon should look to his own restaurants for the next season of Kitchen Nightmares."}
{"text":"The food and service at the bar was amazing. The only thing that can potentially turn an interested customer away, is the DUMB, ditzy hostesses in the beginning.They're all young, highly insecure and know nothing about working in a restaurant. My friend and I were in a long line to get in and this hostess came around 5 different times asking us how many was in our party. She had nothing in hand to keep an orangized record of anything. Meanwhile, the line never even moved! She annoyed and frustrated the many others in line for the same reasons.   On a previous occasion when I decided not to eat there because of a severely long wait, a different hostess never answered a question of mine. Instead, she looked away and started socializing with her fellow ditzy co-worker. That and the long, long wait, really turned me off.   So, if you're planning to try this restaurant, please do, I recommend it for the great food. But here are my tips to success on getting to the great food:  1) Try to figure out a time of the day when they're the least busiest so you can avoid a long wait.  2) Don't ask the hostesses anything, it's pointless, they're pointless.   3) If you happen to be stuck in a long line anyway, (if you're a small party and don't have minors with you), just go sit at the bar. The service there is fast and the bartenders treat you like VIP.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"this place was a perfect blend of AMAZING food, great atmosphere (open, lively, bright, etc), and awesome staff. The waiter, Brian with glasses, i think, was hilarious, and had quite the sense of humor. Not somewhere to go if you are moderately uptight, its a laid back, reasonably priced (for vegas) restaurant. i am so glad we went and checked it out, and i really recommend it to anyone who stops in vegas. The burgers are bomb.com (i dont say that often), and the fries are so good (even if you are a hard-core healthy eater, you'll throw away your food morals for the burger and fries). Also, great selection of brew! two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So delicious!  The poutine was tasty.  The pork/apple burger & Mediterranean burgers were juicy and full of flavor! The onion rings were crisp.  The front display with the flames made a great photo op. Loved it."}
{"text":"The wife and I came here for lunch and we were very impressed! The restaurant had a hip, stylish vibe with the fire decor in the front. Great menu with plenty of more-than-basic options to choose from. I ordered the fish and chips sandwich which was great! She ordered a jalapeño burger and truffle fries which were amazing as well. Only down fall was the two drunk idiots that sat down at our table and started making out.... WTH JUST HAPPENED! The waitress asked if they were with us and quickly got them out HAHA maybe have a railing around the outside table so no one thinks that there's open seating??? Other than the drunken stupidity, I loved every bit of it and definitely recommend going!"}
{"text":"Definitely in the top 3 burgers I've ever had. High quality ingredients and lots of beers on tap!  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen and it was great! My only suggestion would be to fan out the jalapeno and avocado more so it's not all in the middle. The meat was high quality and cooked just like I ordered it. The bun looks like it would be dense but it's this light fluffy little cloud of heaven! The truffle Parmesan fries were very good too, but we got so full on the burgers we didn't finish the fries.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Good waiters. Took 30 minutes to get us our food and it was only a half full restaurant."}
{"text":"Onion rings are awesome ! Tried the American Burger and it was delicious ! Add a skinny acai lemonade....yummy."}
{"text":"For my first trip to Vegas, I had originally planned on filling my bottomless pit stomach at the buffets, but somehow found myself at BurGR instead. After much deliberation of the menu and perusing through pictures on yelp, I ordered the farm burger. As soon as I took my first bite, I knew it was the best burger I had ever eaten. It had looked small in pictures, but in real life it was so big I had to take the top bun off in order to even take a bite. The meat was cooked perfectly to a juicy medium rare, the bacon was flavorful and balanced well between crispy and chewy, and the yolk simply oozed out of the fried egg. Because I ate the top bun separately, I got to taste its buttery, crispy, and fluffy perfection. (I'm really trying to not use \"perfect\" but I can't help it, I have no other way to describe it.)  My friends and I also shared the truffle parmesan fries, which was also one of the best \"fat\" fries I've ever had (I generally like the thin crispy fries). It wasn't overly cheesy, and the two dipping sauces were equally good.  Another plus - all the workers were really attractive...HAHA. Not sure if this is just a Vegas requirement, or if there's a lot of ugly people where I come from. My only complaint is that it's expensive. My burger was $15, and the fries came close at $11, although granted it was a large amount to split between three people. Regardless, I will definitely be back as I have a lot more to try on the menu. Take my money, Gordon Ramsey."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay's BurGR was a surprise to me.  I am a fan of Chef Ramsay, and I've always been praying for him to open a restaurant here in Las Vegas.  First there was the long anticipation of Gordon Ramsay Steak in Paris Hotel, then the big opening of Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill at Caesar's Palace, and out of nowhere Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood.  I have dined at Steak in Paris hotel, and I have met Chef Ramsay at The Grand Tasting in Caesar's palace where he cooked in front of us while telling the media to go F*** themselves because he was busy cooking. And to top it all off, he personally handed me a plate of Beef Wellington which I devoured in less than .006 seconds. (It was one of the best things I've ever tasted)  But now it's time to see how a Michelin Star chef will tackle a more casual dive.  After being greeted by the hostess, you walk into this very modern restaurant where everything is bright and alive. They told me that they modeled the restaurant from Chef Ramsay's show Hell's Kitchen. I don't really know what that means, but all I know is that Ramsay's face is everywhere. I also noticed that all the servers have a good sense of humor and are willing to go the extra mile to make you laugh and to serve, of course.  The server hands you an Ipad where you get to choose your cocktails. desserts, and/or  the restaurant's huge selection of imported beers. We skipped the alcohol  and immediately checked out the desserts, and ended up ordering a Shake #5 (hazelnut pudding and coffee shake topped with a praline cookie)  We Started our meal with the Fury Chicken Wings, Roasted Jalapeno Poppers, and Five Spice Chicken Sliders. The Wings come with 4 pieces of \"tangy hellfire blue cheese wings\", (which tasted like regular buffalo wings with just a little hint of lime) and 4 Honey-wasabi wings (which was color green, and tasted sweet with an aromatic wasabi after-taste, we found it very delightful) The Jalapeno Poppers were really interesting. They serve you 6 Jalapeno poppers, each of them inside a shot glass filled 1/4 way with house ranch.  After I took my first bite, I was surprised how spicy the jalapenos were, and right away warned my girlfriend and her brother that the jalapenos are a tad spicy. They then just looked at me and laughed. After we ate all of them the server came to our table and informed us that they left the seeds in 1 of the jalapenos as a prank to the diners, which explained why my popper was spicier. It was crunchy, cheesy, and spicy! I could have gone for another order of those. The Five Spice Chicken Sliders were just ok.. they taste exactly how they sound minus the Five Spice. We also had an order of regular fries which came with chipotle ketchup, and curry ketchup as your dipping sauce. both were good, but the curry ketchup was a winner.  Now for the Main Course.  I work part time at a gourmet burger food truck and I've always been curious to know how our burger would stand up to Mr. Hell's Kitchen's burger.   We ordered Their Flagship burger which was the Hell's Kitchen Burger and a Pork Belly Dawg.  The Hell's Kitchen Burger has Mexican asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado and roasted tomato. I ordered it medium well,  and the taste of this burger was a mouthful of beefy goodness. Sad to say but they kick our food truck's burger's ass. The hell's kitchen burger was both juicy and flavorful.  The Pork Belly Dawg.................. was one of the worst things I've ever put in my mouth... I can eat pork belly the whole day, I can eat Hotdogs the whole day, so when I saw this on the menu we just had to order it!  The pork Belly comes with pickled edamame, carrots, cucumber and sriracha mayo, which honestly is not a bad combination. What destroyed the dish was the Dawg itself. One bite from this disgusting dawg and our experience was ruined. Have you ever had a spoon full of salt? That's exactly how it tastes like.  We sent back the dawg, and the server asked if we wanted something else. The manager also came to our table and explained that all the dawgs simmer in stock, so at the end of the day the stock absorbs all the flavor of the dawgs, and have \"more flavor\" than it's suppose to.  We exchanged our Pork Belly Dawg for an American Burger, but at this point we didn't have much of an appetite. We only took a couple of bites and ordered dessert.   The Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Pop is a take on Chef Ramsay's Sticky Toffee Pudding Dessert at Gordon Ramsay Steak at Paris Casino. It has 2 layers of sticky pudding, and 2 layers of ice cream. It was delicious, and playful, but not as good as the real Sticky Toffee pudding.. not even close.  Summary:  -The actual menu doubles as a take-home souvinir! -Excellent service! -1 of the Jalapeno Poppers is rigged! -Honey-wasabi wings are very good! (if you like wasab -Come early or eat Salty Dawg"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed here. I'm from San Diego, so it's not hard to find an excellent craft burger or beer just about anywhere near me. What I really hated about this place was standing in a long line for 30 minutes. That's unheard of where I'm from even when going to better burger places. I'm also a vegetarian, so I only had one option here: Gordon Ramsay's Earth Burger.   I will begin by saying our waiter was rather intimidating and not very friendly. He started off by saying that he has tried everything on the menu and asked if I had any questions. He then explained the menu but I was still confused if frys came with the burgers or not. He responded very rudely and said, \"I literally just answered that\". Even though it was my fault for being too hungry and tired and not being able to focus, he didn't need to be an ass. I felt judged by ordering the veggie burger here as well.   So how does this earth burger compare to what I'm used to? It was very greasy, not a good sign with a veggie burger. The ingredients were interesting and artistic, but it's not at all difficult to find a similar and better burger in San Diego. The truffle fries were pretty good but there wasn't a lot of truffle on them, once again I've had better.   My favorite burger places:   1) Burgerlords in LA, CA: Vegan In-N-Out basically.  2) Pure Burger in Carlsbad, CA (create your own craft burger, lot of topping choices/customization and Kombucha/local craft beer on tap 3) Veggie Grill in Hollywood, CA (realistic and convincing vegan burger)"}
{"text":"We always try one new restaurant when visiting LV. I liked the decor; art installation of fire that is hard to describe; HOT but cool.  The burgers and truffle fries were delicious. It does take a LONG time to get your food. $50 for two burgers and a shared order of fries so be prepared."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of burgers but this was the best I've ever eaten. Ordered the Hells Kitchen burger. Mouthwatering & flavorful, cooked perfectly. I expected quality with Gordon Ramsay's name attached but I was blown away. The parmesan truffle fries were the perfect compliment. \"Oh my God\" came out of my mouth every bite. So good. We waited about 15-20 minutes for a table, not bad. Service, atmosphere & food was excellent."}
{"text":"Don't queue or book on the phone, just give your name to the hostess at the front. They will text you when your table is ready! Food is great, meat delicious and well cocked.  Service is great, tvs switched on sport (love it).  The burgers were delicious but a bit small, but so good. You need to go there !!!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST burgers I've ever had. We waited in line for about 15 minutes and the hostess offered us seats at the counter. We gladly took them for the opportunity to see straight into the kitchen. Our server was efficient and was able to recommend items on the food and bar menu for us. It took about 20 minutes for our food but the restaurant was packed and it was entertaining watching the food service up close. My Euro burger with goat cheese was on point! The bun was perfectly toasted, the hamburger patty was seasoned nicely and perfectly cooked medium well as requested. They also GRILL the tomatoes here - why don't more restaurants do this? It was delicious. My boyfriend also enjoyed his Hell's Kitchen Burger. Skip the fries. They don't taste very good and the ketchups they give you aren't that tasty either. Our burgers were $15 and $14 with our Total Rewards Card (saves $1 on each menu item) and the fries were $7 so it wasn't the cheapest of meals but it was very good!"}
{"text":"Let's see. Where do begin? My friend was raving about Gordon Ramsey, who I've never heard of. Yes. Been in the hiding. I was excited to give it a try hearing so many good things about him. Huge fire display in front. Nice. Waited about 20 mins which was ok considering it was. peak hours.  Pros:  Good customer service Burger was cooked to right degree of wellness Cons: Way over priced $21 Burger was small Very bland. In and Out taste more gourmet  Over all very disappointed in quality and presentation"}
{"text":"It was fine. The wait was about 30 minutes for the 2 of us. I was surprised the burger toppings weren't more interesting and exciting. Tourists want accessible, I guess. The burger was decent. I have had better. A lot of bun. $13, then another 8 for fries. The \"push-up\" dessert was amazing. The service was good. The tables are packed in, so you don't have much privacy. The beer list was fairly good. The design of the logo, fire wall, and menu were clever. The curry ketchup was the highlight for me."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my fiancee. We like the casual ambiance and the menu is really cool - gourmet burgers with all sorts of interesting ingredients. I got the uber cheese burger my first time and it was a bit bland. The truffle fries were quite good. The second time around I took my fiancee's advice and got the hell's kitchen burger, and it was delicious.  I must deduct a star because this place feels a bit overpriced ($4 for a fountain drink??), but we recommend nonetheless."}
{"text":"Delicious burger!  We arrived around 9pm on a Friday night, and waited in line for about 20 minutes because we didn't make reservations. I noticed that one of the front desk hostesses didn't seem happy to be there, but the rest of the staff was friendly and courteous.   The food was pretty great. We ordered the hummus appetizer...which was fresh and authentic. The fries (one order can feed two) were crisp, and we especially loved the homemade curry ketchup. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, which was very tasty and cooked exactly to order.   Overall the experience and food was great, but I felt like the flavors of the food didn't live up to the hype (and prices) as much as I expected it would. I don't eat burgers on a regular basis but I've been to another upscale, similarly priced celebrity chef burger joint recently, and the flavors were off the charts in comparison."}
{"text":"Get in line early if you don't want to wait.  My wife and I arrived shortly before opening and requested to sit at the kitchen counter.  It was great to see the staff working in sync.  Surprisingly there was no yelling or cussing among the staff.  Each member of the crew knew what needed to be done. It was great to catch the chef de cuisine catch errors with the burgers as they were going out.  Not many but he has a great eye for detail.    Now on to the food.  My wife and I shared the onion rings and fries.  The truffle fries with truffle aoli was my favorite of the two. actual fresh shaved truffles was in the aoli.  The onion rings were ok.  The cheddar ranch dipping sauce was the star of the onion rings.    The Hell's Kitchen burger and Euro burger we highly recommend.  The seasonings were top notch and the fresh bun was a great addition.  Can't go wrong for a quick/reasonably priced meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmmmm! We eat here every time we visit Las Vegas! The American is my favorite (medium) with truffle fries! The sweet potato fries are so good, topped with powdered sugar...  The service is always on point!  Staff is friendly and on top of things.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly this place has THE BEST HUMMUS IVE EVER HAD! We were looking for a lighter appetizer since we wanted to enjoy the burgers and honestly the hummus blew me away! The burgers were also really good, a classic gourmet restaurant burger. We went two nights in a row so that should tell you something. If you're having second thoughts, don't! This place is great!!"}
{"text":"Very Disappointing.. Too long wait... Service was not good... Ordered the American.. Very bland no taste.. By the time we got it not even warm.. Not cooked to what I asked.. I could see Gordon Flipping if it went out the way it did.. His name is on the restaurant but his quality isn't there.. For the amount of money spent the over all wasn't very good."}
{"text":"Okay, I am not saying I'm some sort of burger connoisseur or anything like that. However, when it comes to my personal preference, this is hands down my favorite burger joint anywhere. I love burgers, almost just as much as I love my wife, but of course, burgers don't put out...let's just leave it at that. In fact, although I love burgers, I am not easily pleased (get your mind out of the gutter) when it comes to burgers.  Now on to the food. When visiting BurGR, I like to order the Euro Burger, which is made with truffle aïoli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomatoes. I love how I can request my burgers well done and they are still juicy when biting into them. Keep in mind that these are Gourmet Burgers, therefore, they aren't that big, however, what they lack in size, they pack with flavor. Every bite is a mouthful of deliciousness (hold your thoughts and stay on topic for crying out loud). I've been here 14 times so far, and I have yet to try any other burger on the menu as this has become not only my go-to burger, but easily my favorite burger, period. Damn, 14 times...I think I have a problem...Hi, my name is CD, and I am addicted to BurGR...  And just when you thought this couldn't get any better, it does. A must have here is their Truffle Parmesan Fries, which are, hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, and truffle aïoli. OMG! These are amazing! Although one of these orders is enough to share, I prefer to get my own, otherwise my wife eats them all.  The only negative that I can find with this place is how long the wait can be sometimes. If you're impatient, or starving, perhaps you should try going during off-peak hours avoiding the lunch and dinner crowds.  If you didn't already gather that from my review, well, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would like to call myself a burger connoisseur since I can eat burgers every day of my life.  With that being said, this place has some awesome gourmet burgers!  Located in the Planet Hollywood Casino Resort, it is pretty loud.  The burgers come a la carte and aren't terribly huge like other burger restaurants.  But don't be fooled by the size.  Everything is perfect and the meat is ridiculous! I can't describe how tender and scrumptious the burger patty was.  You can order fries and onion rings separately.  They also have a wide array of beers and they bring you an iPad to look over their drink menu.  After your meal you can walk around all the different stores in the casino which is like a little mall."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to not have to wait in the long line at BurGr because I was by myself and sat at the bar.  I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was awesome.  Very well cooked and the flavors were great.  I also ordered a side of fries and they were good but definitely meant for two people to share.  Great burger but if I had to wait in the line I'd probably pick another place to eat."}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed with the burger I had. The meat was thick and and not very tasty. Just a regular burger to me. But the dessert now that was phenomenal. I had the Oreo milkshake with crème brûlée on top and it was lightly toasted to perfection. (Compared to the actual crème brûlée I had at Nine steakhouse that was burnt). Will go again but only for dessert."}
{"text":"All we ate was a burger, fries and a beer for 2 people. Our bill was $80! Most of the time when the food is amazing I will let them take my money. But when the truffle burgers has no flavor, was tough to swallow and the truffle fries and regular fries both taste like stale old pieces of cardboard. Paying $80 feels like your heart is being torn into pieces.  All I am saying is don't be fooled by long lines and a full restaurant because it is a lie. And if you still plan on eating here the Hell's Burger is probably the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"A great experience all around. Had to wait for a little over an hour to be seated, but we were there on a Saturday during dinner, so it was kind of expected. And there was certainly plenty of entertainment around.   The staff was friendly and attentive, the beer selection was wonderful. We had two delicious appetizers between five of us.   When our food arrived, it was spectacular. We got three orders of fries between us, but the highlight of bunch were the truffle parmesan fries. So frakkin good. My burger was cooked a perfect medium-rare and was amazing. Definitely recommend the Farm Burger.  I found the prices reasonable and will for surely return in the future."}
{"text":"Wait time - We went to eat around 9 pm on a Friday night and it was about a 10 minute wait, although I overheard 45 minutes to 1.5 hours for larger parties.  Hell's Kitchen Burger - I ordered my mom the Hell's Kitchen Burger which, according to their menu, has \"asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and an oven roasted tomato.\" We ordered the burger medium well and it came out perfectly medium well. That patty is thick, I mean really thick. We're not used to eating such thick burgers. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and flavorful.  Truffle Parmesan Fries - I really recommend ordering to share. Even though you might get a little greedy upon first bite, you'll have a food baby if you don't share it. This came with homemade ketchup and truffle aioli. My goodness this was the star of the show. Mom hoarded the aioli, but that's fine with me because she was hurting after ingesting too much fat later (hehheh). The fries came out hot and crispy and well-seasoned. It had a hint of truffle but not too much to overpower the flavor of potatoes and the ketchup went very well with it. The aioli was delicious as well, but I got a little overwhelmed dipping deep fried food into pure fat. The ketchup created a nice balance.  Soba Noodle Chicken Salad - I ordered the Soba Noodle Chicken Salad which came with two skewers of chicken marinated in sriracha. The noodles are tossed in a cilantro honey peanut dressing. This is by no means a light dish, but I really couldn't stomach a burger. I didn't finish this and had a little bit of the burger and shared this with my mom. This is a cold salad but it was quite satisfying. I forgot how unhungry I was after having my first bite. I loved the texture of the noodles and the dressing was right down my alley. What could be better than food smothered in peanut butter? Well, it wasn't exactly peanut butter, but it was very peanutty. This dish has a sweetness to it and the spicy savory chicken skewers balanced everything out. The vegetables were crunchy and refreshing. My mom surprisingly fell in love with this dish. She's not too fond of ordering Asian-themed foods at non-Asian restaurants, but she finished all of her portion of the noodles and left behind some of the burger! That's a first for her.  Service - All in all, this was a great burger experience. Service was efficient and fast. Food came out fresh, hot, and flavorful. We really wanted to try his famous shakes that is topped off with pudding, but we were just too full."}
{"text":"Everything was great. Chicken wings to start. All Burgers were yummy. Service was great. Eric the busser made our experience perfect"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay has really made a name for himself, both in the TV world and in the culinary world. I love a good burger and made it a point to visit Gordon Ramsay's BurGR on my most recent trip to Vegas. The restaurant is located within Planet Hollywood and is the first restaurant when entering Miracle Mile off of Vegas Boulevard. For a Monday afternoon there was a bit of a line, perhaps 15-20 people and you simply wait in line and aren't given a pager.  After being seated, our friendly waiter came by to take our drink order and showed us an iPad with a selection of specialty cocktails. Early on I was tempted on ordering one of their massively-sized Devil Dawgs, but thought you can't come to BurGR and not get a burger. After asking our waiter for some personal suggestions, I opted for the honey-pig bao buns as our appetizer and the Euro burger, which he personally recommended.   Considering how busy BurGR was, our drink order and appetizer came out rather quick. My +1 didn't indulge in the bao buns which meant more for me. The roasted pork belly was perfectly tender and the fresh cilantro and honey sauce made for one delicious appetizer. The bao buns dripped with roasted pork juice and their honey-hoisin sauce.   After ravishing through the two bao buns, the Euro burger came out soon after. I can't stress enough that all their burgers look like masterpieces when served. The Euro burger looked almost too good to eat. The burgers are grilled over apple and alder wood and my burger had a truffle aioli, oven roasted tomato, arugula, and a mouth watering goat cheese that made all the difference. The cook on the medium rare patty was just right and the combination of flavors exploded through every bite. The artisan bun rounded out one of the best burgers I've tried.  I have to admit I got a little sad as the meal came to an end. The burger was just right in every aspect. It wasn't a ginormous Vegas-sized burger, but more of a subtle and refined burger by the world-famous Gordon Ramsay. The burger is a little pricey at $15 especially since it doesn't come with any fries or sides. Nonetheless, you are in a Gordon Ramsay establishment and the man is serious about quality control. If you're a burger lover or like one of his many shows, Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a must try.   Ambiance/Decor: 4/5 Food: 5/5 Service: 4/5 Price: $$ Overall: 5/5  Pros: + Affordable Gordon Ramsay restaurant  + Specialty burgr menu + Delicious burgers (Euro burger!) + Generous portions + Friendly staff and service (cute waitresses) + Reasonable wait time + Souvenirs for sale (glassware, books, etc.)  Cons: - Wait time can vary on day/time - No reservations"}
{"text":"Was hungry but didn't want a buffet meal in Vegas. Sat at the counter. Ordered a hamburger, fries and iced tea. All said and done, it was $25+ including tip. That meal was not worth $25. Hamburger was juicy, but not much flavor. I was expecting more for GBR"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for awhile. Everytime i walk by it's busy.....well, tried it tonight with a good friend of mine. Place was busy. Hostesses were pleasant, we were greeted within a minute with cassie our waitress who was great. I liked the ipad presentation and menu. Nice touch. Both of us had the cheeseburgers. Mine was probably the best burger that i can remember. Fries were also good. Not a big fan of the chipolte ketchup or the curry ketchup. When i asked for regular ketchup, theres had a little bitter taste to it.....but that was minor when talking about the overall experience. I definately will be bringing my friends back here....."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Expected so much more.  We had both the regular fries and the parm.  Both were AWFUL.  The price ($7/$11) seemed to be more for the fancy little cone they are served in than the quality of the product.  They were greasy and soggy beyond belief.  I think we ate 2-3 each.  Burgers were dry.  Could have gotten a better burger and fries at a McDonald's for far less money.  And what's with the seats that are practically on the floor?  Not a relaxing dinner when the table is chest high.  Would not return."}
{"text":"After going to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill the night before, this was 100x better. We got there right at 11 so we wouldn't have to wait for a table. This place is clearly popular and there were 10 parties waiting at 11 already so if you have to wait a long time, it should be no bearing on how you rate the restaurant. There were lots of tables, lots of staff, and when we left around 12:30 the place was teeming.   Our server was very knowledgeable, she explained the menu and gave us her recommendations. Her service was great and she kept checking in on us.  The burgers were delicious - no complaints. We got the sweet potato fries that we could barely finish as there were so many. This place was priced very reasonably considering that it's a Vegas restaurant. For $13-15 a burger, you can't really complain.  Great place and we're sad we didn't get to try the shakes."}
{"text":"again I visited a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. and again nothing special.   there is a line to get into this place. look we just wanted a burger and fries. we did get that, but not going back.  the decor is cool, the servers are cool also. but wait times are crazy long! 30-50 minutes to get a burger and fries at inflated casino prices?!? no thanks.  I ordered the spicy burger, medium rare with truffle fries and mug root beer.   I'm going to keep this simple....  burger was undercooked. it seemed like it wasn't flipped on the side that had the cheese. the meat was bright pink. I'm hoping I don't get sick.  the fries were good  the mug root beer that shows on the menu comes in the glass that the water comes in, so it's not a mug...just a glass of fountain root beer.  2-3 stars max. nothing special to stand in line for, what, 30-40 minutes to wait another 30-50 minutes to get 6-8oz burger patty. no thanks"}
{"text":"Really fun \"Vegas\" experience!  Well-priced, fun environment, delicious food.  The hot dogs maaaaay be even better than the burgers.  It's worth at least ordering one and splitting it with someone.  They are big and amazing.  Great apps, too.  The jalapeno poppers are great!  They don't do reservations, but they were very accomodating to our group of 7."}

So in all - Food A+, but service (on this night) C.   Usually it's a great time; great food, great drinks, but never go here with a big group that is waiting for other people to come to order...."}
{"text":"Overall good quality food. I think I was just expecting a little more from Gordon Ramsey.   The restaurant itself is nice as all restaurants are on the strip. We ordered the onion rings with parmesan and truffle oil, and the two housemade sauces. For burgers I had the farm burger with the egg on top and my boyfriend got the classic. The ingredients were fresh (avocado etc), the patties were generously portioned and perfectly cooked to our liking. However the farm burger could have used a lot more seasoning. With Gordon Ramsey always being so tough on people in his shows, I was a little disappointed that the burger was lacking something as simple as salt.   The waiters presented the drinks, desserts, and restaurant merchandise on an iPad, which enabled a more high impact display. While that was nice, it didn't seem that the high top table we sat at had the space to accommodate. Additionally the rest of the food items for the menu were on a separate print copy, and you couldn't order the drinks or desserts using the iPad. Perhaps they are still testing how they was to integrate the technology, but we just found it slightly piece meal and confusing."}
{"text":"I was pretty stoked to come here (big fan of Mr. Ramsay).  The wait wasn't too bad. The ambience is cool. And the decor was exciting.   I ordered the Farm Burger; which was absolutely delicious, and two cocktails.   The service was nice. Everyone was fast, friendly and efficient! So 5 stars :-)"}
{"text":"Was in town for a friend's bachelor party rolling 13 deep and, as the foodie of the group, I was delegated to choose eating spots for the weekend. I'm huge Gordon Ramsay fan so I had to put this place on the itinerary. Disappointingly, the restaurant couldn't accommodate all of us at one table, so we had to split up. Which turned out to be fine because, aside from that, the experience was awesome and everyone loved the dining choice.  We started with an order of awesome Truffle Parmesan Fries, deliciously crispy Onion Rings and the best Jalapeno Poppers I've ever had in my life. An order of poppers come in a set of six in a great presentation of individual shot glasses with each popper sitting in a chipotle-ranch sauce. One of my friends walked clear across the restaurant from the other table to tell us how amazing he thought the poppers were.  On to the main event -- the burgers. All the guys thoroughly enjoyed their burgers. I ordered the Farm Burger which had duck breast bacon, cheddar cheese and a fried egg. Seriously, duck breast bacon? Simply awesome... and a fried egg with a runny yolk just makes everything better. The massive burger patty was juicy and perfectly cooked. The bun choice was great and held everything together beautifully.  Overall, the food was fantastic and complemented by the excellent service. Upon getting seated, our server gave us recommendations and we stuck to them for the most part. He was right on the money with the suggested menu items, which included the Jalapeno Poppers and the Farm burger. Attentive and quick service with top-notch food. Can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"After watching the show KA we made our way to Burgr which is a tradition for us since the place opened because we can't get enough of the Gordon Ramsey Burgers.  We came with a group of friends and we consider ourselves to be big foodies and we wanted to make sure to have everyone try all the burgers, so we ordered 6 different ones and a few orders of the Truffle Parmesan Fries that came with truffle aioli. We had to ask for extra aioli because everyone was fighting over it, I think my friend was licking the tiny ramekins it came in lol.  We all agreed that our favorite burgers were the:  Farm burger-come on anything with duck bacon is going to be good in my book. And then to add and egg onto that. Use the fries to soak up all that gooey yolk.    Euro burger- hello it has truffle aioli, goat cheese, and roasted tomato. Talk about having an explosion of flavors in your mouth.   Until next time! I can't wait"}
{"text":"4.5 Describes it better because it wasn't perfect, but it was pretty darn good!  The maui onion rings are excellently battered, light and flavorful.  Standard jazzed up ketchup and \"aoli\" (mayo based sauce) for dipping.  Burgers were OUTSTANDING.  I had the Chantrelle Burger and my buddy got the hell's kitchen.  They looked so good we cut them in half to share!  The shakes are amazing as well, thick and quality.  The drink menu consists of all girly drinks...  My whiskey lemonade had just too much of that sweet fake cherry drizzle for my liking but thats the only negative I can really think of.  I will be back!  That is if Vegas hasn't burnt to the ground before I get a chance to make it back..."}
{"text":"I see lots of great reviews. Either this place has gone down hill or people don't have high expectations.   After eating here, I would infer if Gordon were to make a surprise visit, he'd be yelling profanity.  The server was unfriendly and barely came to check on us.   Bottom line: $55 for 2 burgers, fries, onion rings, and 1 soda.   Onion rings- fantastic!  Earns a star.   Burgers- the highlight of the burger is the bun, because that's what you'll taste when you bite into the sandwich.  A dry, large bun will overtake the burger patty end whatever else is on it.   Truffle fries- not good.     For a world famous chef with his name on the restaurant, this was a bummer and we will never be back.   Want a fantastic burger?  Take an Uber to Carson Kitchen downtown.  It's worth getting away from the strip to try."}
{"text":"A decent burger...but I say come for the shakes.  Having dined here multiple times, I have experienced consistently good food and somewhat slow service (usually have to flag down a server for a utensil, straw, drink refill, additional food order, or bill)  I really wanted to love the burgers here, but after trying the Brittania, Farm, Turkey, Southern Yardbird, and Hell's Kitchen burgers..I'm left with the same impression: they're just OK.Not life changing for me...just average.  The truffle parmesan fries are a bit too salty for my liking. The sweet potato fries, just fries, and the onion rings (while they have improved in the past year) are average as well.  At this point, I have realized that I usually come to BurGR just for the opportunity to have one of their shakes. I have tried all 5 shakes and found them to be a perfect match for my sweets cravings at the time. My usual go tos are Shake #2 coconut pudding + strawberry shake + chocolate cookie, Shake #4 crème brûlée pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie and Shake #5 chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake+ praline cookie.  Tip:Avoid the long wait and try to dine before the peak lunch/dinner hours"}
{"text":"This was my second time dining here.  Our waiter, whose name escapes my mind due to my hungover mind, was extremely friendly.   Friday 11:25am: wait was approximately 10 mins. line moveed slowly even though there were lots of tables open, but I'm not complaining.  I got the Hell's Kitchen burger with jalapenos and generous amounts of avocado. I ordered my patty medium-rare but it was medium.   The burgers were very clean and not greasy.   My friend also loved the turkey burger.  We also shared some fries. curry ketchup tastes great.  Great burgers. Great service. Price isn't too bad for Vegas. Check it out."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Our server Matthew didn't amazing job and was  super attentive  do the entire meal. Oh and the jalapeno poppers changed my life! A+"}
{"text":"This was our last stop on our Gordon Ramsay food tour. The atmosphere is a little stuffier than you'd expect for a burger place, but the servers were nice regardless. We got the jalapeño poppers, which set my throat on fire, and we both got the uber cheese burger. I added avocado to mine and my husband did the bacon.   All in all, the burgers were delicious. The meat was well seasoned and the buns were nice and toasty. However, if I hadn't ordered avocado on mine, my burger would have been dry. There were no veggies or sauces on either of our burgers--literally just meat, cheese and bun. One might argue that a well seasoned burger doesn't need sauce or veggies, and they would be right! BUT the option of having some veggies would be nice for people who need to soften the beef experience.   We got out of here for around $60, and it's another experience I wouldn't need to have again. It was good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"Had to try the Gordon Ramsey Burger, very busy and a long line but I was able to get in quickly. Had the farm burger and the Buffalo wings which both were very good. I have to go back to try their shakes because they look so good, and they top them off with pudding!"}
{"text":"Twice in three days, both times delicious! The Maui onion rings with multiple dips, the pork belly pockets, and the chicken wings were awesome. There's a secret menu too... the Gordon Ramsay Burger isn't on the menu, but it has duck bacon and avocado, delicious. Big craft beer selection and good margaritas. For desert, the sticky toffee pudding in a push pop! Clever and tasty! Burgers take 25 mins, but get some fries with a side of truffle mayo and you won't notice. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm a Gordon Ramsay fangirl as much as the next person, and after a good experience at Steak this was next on my list to try. Prior to seeing the O show, BF and I came here for dinner on a Friday night- not thrilled that they don't take reservations so the line wraps around the corner for a predictable 30 minute minimum wait. But the hostess was super sweet and the wait went fast.  BEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS: The cheddar-ranch dip made this dish for me, but wasn't enough to save the rings for my guy, who felt they were overly breaded and not crispy enough. Wouldn't get again but loved the sauce.  HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno pepper, avocado, and oven roasted tomato. Looked a bit more delicious than it actually tasted, the jalapeno is a kick in the mouth that is quickly quelled by the cold, creamy avocado and roasted tomato. Wish it came with more than one roasted jalapeno, the first bite of combined flavors was best, the rest only had one or two of the featured ingredients and came off as bland.  FARM BURGER: duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. The egg makes this, but everyone else seems to say the bacon makes it. I'm not a huge bacon fan but expected to be converted by this one. Not so much. Egg yolk plus medium-rare burger was delish, cheese flavor was lost and overpowered by the other ingredients.  TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES: After the 'rings ordeal, I didn't think we needed another side but BF insisted. The order is enormous and even with our large appetites we did not come close to finishing. The truffle parm and truffle salt don't hold a candle to the amazing truffle aioli.   SHAKE #5: coffee shake, chocolate pudding, \"praline cookie\". Served in one giant glass with two wide boba-style straws, this was a tasty treat. Liked that it wasn't super sweet. Praline cookie is more of a wafer without much flavor.    OVERALL:  Food didn't quite live up to the hype: bummed there isn't a mushroom burger with cheese on the menu, for the two burgers we did order, the cheese was understated. Would customize a burger on a future visit, subbing chantrelle mushrooms for the tomato on the Euro burger. The burgers are solid, and the beef is great quality, but I expected better.  Shout out to the hostess, who was super sweet, brought out a menu to view while in line, was the first of two staff to recommend the HK burger we ended up getting."}
{"text":"Best burgers on the strip hands down. DELISH. Milkshakes are so so, but everything else (pork belly app? OMG) TOP NOTCH."}
{"text":"Good burgers but not the best I've had by any means. Service was great and the truffle fries were amazing. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here just because of the name."}
{"text":"We're Gordon Ramsay fans, and on all our trips to Vegas this place always alluded us. It was pretty stellar. The environment was very cool. It looks bigger than you'd expect. The chairs are comfy, and everything felt intimate. I ordered the Farm Burger, my spouse the Chanterelle Burger, and we shared the Truffle Parmesan fries. The Farm, with sharp cheddar, duck bacon, and a fried egg was DELICIOUS. Honestly tasty stuff. The fries were like crack. The Chanterelle was great on flavor, but there was a slight sliminess to the texture that wasn't the best- the mushrooms, or maybe the sauce? Also got a FANTASTIC milk shake- strawberry with coconut pudding on top. DANG it was good. The waiter was nice, but the hotties at the hostess desk could have been friendlier and more communicative about our wait time. As for the people bitching about the prices/value- take several seats, and go to In and Out if you're so cheap. This is a gourmet burger place, not fast food. All in all it was a great dinner. We'd like to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"A group of 4 of us showed up here at 6pm for dinner, only waited about 20 minutes on Friday night. We were starving, so we quickly ordered a round of their signature cocktails, jalapeno poppers and beer-battered onion rings to start. These items might sound like normal bar entrees.... nothing of the sort.  Both were original, high quality and amazingly savory and bursting with flavor. We ordered the Whiskey Cherry lemonade, Skinny Tangerine Screwdriver thing, Jalapeno 'Rita and another lemonade cocktail. We were all very happy with the originality of them... and alcohol content!! Dinner was Farm Burger (A++), the chicken burger (A+) and the Four Cheese Burger with duck bacon added (A++).  The sweet potato fries, dusted with powdered sugar and the honey jalapeno aioli.... pure genius in that combination.  We are already planning a trip back... mostly because we want to make it to their amazing desserts next time!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  That was one tasty burger.  I had the \"Gordon Ramsey\" special burger.  It...was...amazing.  The sweet potato fries were awesome too, with a good dipping sauce.  I really can't stand Gordon Ramsay as a television personality.  What a turd.  But I have to say, the service was impeccable, the price was reasonable, and the burger was one of the best five I've had in my life, so he's doing something right.  I'd come back."}
{"text":"Great place, was there with my family order a burger with side, very delicious. Draft beer, burgers all you need in this place. I like  atmosphere inside and food.In the middle of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"What can I say other than WOW! The burger. And fish were to die for. Onion rings were tasty. The fury chicken wings were divine. Atmosphere was loud and busy but it's the experience that counts. Gordon Ramsey wins with another great restaurant."}
{"text":"The wait could be a little long this place gets busy! Pretty good for the price. Me and my gf ordered the gooey fries ($13), the farm burger ($15) and a truffle burger  ($21). The burgers look small when they come out but it's very filling! We had to to-go half of our food. I honestly think one order of fries and a burger is good enough for two people.  Gooey fries, comes with cheese, bacon, and an egg on top. Pretty good, but in my opinion way too cheesy and gets bland, the cheese hardens and it doesn't become edible, stick with regular fries!  Farm burger came with duck breast bacon and an egg. So filling but so good! I ordered medium rare and the Patty was so soft and flavorful.  The truffle burger for 21$ in my opinion was okay. It's a plain burger with pea sprouts and truffle sauce, I guess they really want you to taste the truffle and not have other veggies or add ons interfere with the taste. You definitely taste the truffle sauce, I'm not a big fan of truffle so it was okay.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The wait was a little long, the decor was noisy and nothing special, the service was adequate - the food was exquisite. I feel bad for those who have gone to a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and somehow did not get to taste the magic of this man's phenomenal talent, even as passed down through the restaurants and employees who represent his name. An unforgettable dinner."}
{"text":"The only reason why I had to take a star off is because of the annoying hosts but let's start with the...  GOOD= *THE FOOD Is perfection. First off who doesn't watch masterchef and dream of eatint Gordon Ramsey's food? He is world famous for a reason. The burgers were the perfect blend of flavors, the hells  kitchen burger was sweet and spicy, It was insanely good.  *The food portion sizes were just right *The gooey fries are the BEST fries I have come across in my life *Food was quick around 15 mins to prep *Bar with interesting fancy cocktails and drinks although pricey *Prices were actually not bad, it was about $16 for a burger. Totally worth it *cool and simple menu  BAD= *stupid hosts who stand around and create a line when there are several open tables, also gave a table of 2 to a couple behind us when we were waiting wtf"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and sides. Order the jalapeño poppers and you get a spicy surprise with one of them. Truffle fries are amazing not greasy at all. And the burgers....well you will mop the grease off your plate with your fries."}
{"text":"The food here is definitely the highlight.  The atmosphere is casual and lively.  The service is friendly but if you don't particular like something they do nothing to help fix it.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger wanting a little spice but it was bland when I asked for a little spice I got oh sorry and walked away.  Not what I would expect but it's in planet Hollywood and I am just one person"}
{"text":"A very satisfying lunch. Everything was good from the bun, the pickle to the burger patty.  Just as the restaurant opens for business, there was a line of people waiting to get in at 11am. I passed by about four hours later and still see people waiting for a table.  Definitely will return."}
{"text":"The burger was pretty darn good. Was it so amazing that I would fly back to Vegas for it? Probably not. Is it 3000+ review amazing? No. But it is a tasty burger. Coming from NYC where we have amazing restaurants stacked on top of each other (literally), I am a difficult customer to please. Never the less, I felt that the burgers here were juicy, well cooked, and well flavored. The ingredients of each burger complemented each other well. The truffle fries were great as usual. Just like truffle mac and cheese, once you've had it, you've had it, but it doesn't make it any less delicious.  The couple we came with got a milk shake which looked really good but seemed to be a little thinner than the ones I'm use to (i.e. jack in the crack, Micky D's). I got the toffee push pop thingy on the suggestion of many Yelpers. I talked it up so much before it arrived on the table, but once I tasted it, I realized that I didn't like it. The flavors were much too intense. Too much salt and sugar together. My tastebuds got no reprieve. Even so, I had to lie and say I loved it in front of the girlfriend because you know, I can't be wrong.  Anyways, if you're looking for fat and flavor, this is the place. There's nothing subtle about the food here, which is probably the same thing I could say about your waistline if you eat here too often."}
{"text":"Finallly got the try this place out after I spotted it being constructed last time out in Vegas.   Be prepared to wait, especially if you have a large party. This place is always packed and even though I was eating by myself, I still had to wait about 30 minutes. They do have a cool texting service though that will let you know through text when you're reservation is ready. AND not to mention that you can easily go shopping as well when waiting or gambling since there are tables and slots right outside of the restaurant.  Decided to order the Hell's kitchen burger with Truffle parmesian fries. The burger and fries looked fantastic and you could tell that they really put a lot of pride in their food based on the appearance of the food. The burger was very juicy, cooked medium rare just the way I like it! Contrary to what others say, this burger is not that spicy at all. It also does have a nice sweet taste which went with the mild spiciness of the burger. All ingredients were very fresh and the burger was great!   The fries were the the highlight of the night! The fries are humongous and easily shareable with two people. The parmesian went great with the fries and all of the seasonings on the fries provided a great touch. They weren't too crispy and weren't too soft; I highly recommend trying them out.  This place is pretty pricey though as getting a burger and fries could easily run you 30-35 bucks. SHARE the fries as it is definitely enough to share between a couple of people. Good stuff and great location real close to the miracle mile shops and planet hollywood."}
{"text":"Service is just phenomenal and burgers simply delicious. My favorite is the Hell's Kitchen Burger which has jalapeños."}
{"text":"I came here thinking it would be something amazing-- I left full, but not amazed. I got there early at 11:00am sharp to make sure I wouldn't have to wait too long, and I was correct, there was only a line of 6 parties before me. When I got seated at the table with really low seats, the menu great! So cute! We ordered truffle fries, Hells Kitchen Burger, Farm burger and the Oreo shake with Crème brulee pudding. The burger patty was not seasoned well, fries were just fries with truffle flavor plopped on top(which made it a little salty), and the Oreo shake with crème brulee was delicious but way too sweet and rich. My favorite was the oreo shake. I was expecting an explosion of flavor from the Burger after reading over 1,000 reviews and tips, but nope.. it was just a burger.  I am glad I did not have to wait too long because my food experience here was just ok. I was really full after the food, and took home half the shake, some fries and half the farm burger. The portions are good, but the flavor from the patty was lacking in my opinion.   Note to self: the Hells Kitchen Burger does not include onion. If you come back, please add onions. :) & ask to cut burger in half just in case you cant finish it (it will be less messy than cutting it yourself)"}
{"text":"Had the farmhouse burger and a side order or poutine. The poutine was unique with mushrooms and duck gravy. The burger was yummy and the two items filled two of us up. My only negative is the restaurant is very loud with no soft material to absorb sound. So don't come here if you want to have a friendly conversation."}
{"text":"The line is always long (hour wait) and right in front of the fireplace of Hell's Kitchen. Seriously, it's 100 degrees outside in Vegas and Gordon Ramsay needs a fireplace.   The burgers ranges from $13-$18 and extra cash for that... fries. Honestly, burgers are overrated and really the highlight. The winner here is the Oreo Cème Brûlée Pudding Milkshake #9 and Truffle Parmesan Fries. Yes, it that in your life. I'd put money on it. See what I just did there? It was a gambling joke people."}
{"text":"I must preface this by saying that I absolutely adore Gordon. I basically watch all of his shows and when it was made clear that we were coming to Vegas, trying his burger place and steakhouse were in the upper echelons of our bucket list.   First off, it's very important to note that this place has great service staff that are truly friendly and they definitely praise the Ramsay brand. Either way, back to the important part: the food.   My girlfriend and I started with sharing the jalapeño cheddar poppers which were absolutely divine. Good job, Gordon. We then went with two different burgers and a side of fries as well as honey mustard dip and mayo. The burgers were truly cooked to perfection: the meat was flavorful, tender and juicy. They had got the most difficult part of a burger right. Now, unfortunately, the simple stuff they completely failed at. A burger is not supposed to be pretentious and an example of BURGR trying too hard is that they pickled their cucumbers in cinnamon - fucking awful.   The mayo was absolutely terrible and I was shocked by how bad it was. It just tasted like olive oil. I'd pay 10x more to get regular Heinz Mayo. (Again, why complicate the simple elements?)  The honey mustard was among the most nasty sauces I've ever tried: again the distinct olive oil flavor was present and was paired with the flavor of liquid Tylenol. Ugh.  The fries that we got were cut too thick and therefore were mealy and hard.   This place gets a 3-star for completely disappointing me, charging us $80 for two burgers and screwing up the simple elements. Disappointed. There are better burger places for half the cost - the only difference is that they don't have Gordon's name attached to it."}
{"text":"Excellent all around.  You need to check in with a hostess at the end of the rope line and she will check you in and give you a time estimate.  If you are a ranked player with the casino you get higher priority.  You will get a update text while waiting and when to return to get your seat.  Then you can walk around the strip as you wait, depending on the wait time. The resturant was full when we got there around lunch on a Saturday. The menu is fairly small but there are options.  The staff are laid back but attentive.  The food was great and the pricing was quite fair for what you get.  We will return whenever we decide go back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I regret every minute that I spent waiting to eat at BurGR.    For my birthday in Vegas, my husband and I wanted something low key but still delicious.  So at 8pm on a Thursday night, we found ourselves waiting in line for a burger inside of Planet Hollywood.  Although there was a long line, I felt assured that the 4 star yelp rating and the name \"Gordon Ramsay\" was enough of a promise to make the wait worth-while.  Once we had finally made it to the front of the line, we were \"greeted\" by some \"I'm just here b/c it's a summer job\" hostesses.   In my opinion, the hostesses here are unwelcoming and rude; it wouldn't hurt to put on a smile and say something like, \"Thank you for waiting\" instead of the deadpan stare I got from the 3 blonds with \"mean girl\" attitudes; shoot, was I not supposed to wear pink today?!  It's such a shame because they're the first people you encounter from the restaurant after waiting 45 minutes!    Anyhow, maybe they treat you like crap b/c their food is THAT good.  Perhaps once I try their burgers, it'll be like an abusive relationship where although they make me feel like crap, I just keep coming back...Burger Nazi, perhaps?  But this sort of neglect continued once we were seated.  After waiting about 5 minutes without even being offered something to drink, we had to wave down a server to bring us some water.  What I still didn't understand was why they had 3 mean girls up front, just standing around and talking while the waiters were running around all short-staffed.  As Chef Ramsay would say, \"MANAGE THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE!\"   After some 20 minutes, we put in our order. And then.... MORE waiting. For appetizer, we order the onion rings -- which didn't come out as an appetizer, but with our burgers and fries.  The onion rings were good -- but not good enough to wait 45+ minutes.  Also, their open kitchen concept really works against them because I saw SEVERAL orders of onion rings and fries just waiting under the heat lamp for the longest time.  That's why when we got our fries with our meal, it was soggy and cold.  I didn't even bother to send it back for a new batch because who knew how long it would take to get food after that?!  The burgers?  Uneventful. I ordered the Farm Burger, which sounds better than it tastes.  My husband ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, which is better than the former, but still not amazing.  The meat inside the burgers were lacking juice and flavor, but it was the overall experience that was seemed sub-par.  And lastly, the white truffle fries, as delicious as that sounds, just had a mound of parm cheese on it -- it definitely showed a lack of quality control in the kitchen -- sometimes, less is more.  Gordon Ramsay must have a lot of backfire from doing his shows because he always emphasizes perfection and high standards for his food and restaurants.  It's such a shame that this place has his \"name\" attached to it because it really does a disservice to his overall brand -- it makes him look like a fraud.  Now, I've been to his other restaurants, so I know that it's not necessarily the menu that needs adjusting, but rather it's the service team and the communication between the kitchen and servers that is the culprit to BurGR's subpar standards.  They should really get their act together.   The manager came by at the end of the meal and offered to comp our onion rings because it didn't come out as an appetizer as we ordered.  Despite his efforts to offer an olive branch, I would never come back and wouldn't recommend this place to any one else."}
{"text":"So thankful for fellow yelpers!  I read the reviews and ordered the Britannia burger cooked medium.  My husband ordered the farm burger, and we shared an order of onion rings.  I can honestly say that these were two of the best burgers we have ever devoured.  I enjoyed every bite!  The patty was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  You can tell that the best ingredients are used.  The bread was perfectly toasted.  And the flavors blended flawlessly.   One extra tip: The waitress asked if it was our first time dining there.  After we ordered, she told us that we could keep the menus if we wanted.  Fun souvenir!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Me and my girlfriend order The Farm Burger, and it was a taste sensation. It's the best place we ate at in Las Vegas. Presentation, taste, service all great. I've never had a burger like it, and maybe I will never have one like it again. You have to go here."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place so much because of all the fame and notoriety of Chef Gordon Ramsay. It should have exuded elegance and quality but, instead, it bordered on mediocrity and disappointing.  Before planning our trip I researched Yelp, and YouTube and was super excited by all the raving reviews and accolades this restaurant has received over the years.  The pics and vids looked excellent and the food looked mouthwatering.  But, all was just a farce...  Ordered the No.1 Shake... Omfg!!! They've successfully managed to encapsulate a heart attack in a glass.  Not only could you not suck the contents through a straw, scooping out with a spoon proved no less difficult.  It must mean something when you cannot even pour out  the contents no matter how much you tilt the glass (I had it laying down horizontally on the table).  Ordered a Farm Burger,  Euro Burger, and a Fried Fish Crisp Sandwich.  Of the three, the fish sandwich shined above the others.  How ironic that a \"non-burgr\" item was the star!  It was light, crispy, juicy and tender the way a proper fish 'n chip should be prepared. And the bread was soft, tender and, from what we told, homemade.  The Farm Burger was utterly flavorless and dry (which was surprising since it was prepared medium rare) while the Euro Burger garnered some praise from our group due to the goat cheese (I'm not a fan btw). However, it too lacked the moistness and tenderness a burger should possess.  The Onion Rings were actually quite outstanding with the crispness and lightness we did not expect.  The Truffled Parmesan Fries... [/Gordon Ramsay Voice] TOO F*$KING SALTY!!!!!!!!  To add insult to injury, the overall condition of the place was abysmal. Tables were scratched up, the leather placemats were stained, utensils were heavily covered with detergent/hard water stains, and forks were caked on with dried food!  I left the place feeling full but not satisfied.  The one aspect of this restaurant earning two stars from me was the service.  We were greeted with a friendly smile, our food was brought out to us in a timely and friendly fashion, and all our requests were responded to promptly and efficiently.  I wanted to like it but cannot, in good conscience, recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious! A little on the salty side, but definitely A LOT of bursts of flavor. The buffalo chicken wings are delicious, but I would do without the blue cheese. The jalepeno poppers are AMAZING but very fattening so be prepared to feel FULL. I had the jalepeno chili dog also which was kind of salty but a lot of flavor!"}
{"text":"The yard burger chicken sandwich is great! Add some onion rings (with ranch cheddar dipping sauce) ahi burger appetizer and the creme brûlée cookies and cream shake and you have a winning meal. I recommend this place if you are looking for a great burger (or chicken sandwich) and/or a great dessert."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon BURGR by accident while perusing Miracle Mile after enjoying a show.  Here is the down low ... -Place is massive,  well decorated, and welcoming -The price caught us a bit off guard (then again, we are in Las Vegas, and dining in one of Ramsay's joint ... but after late dindin, we agreed it was well worth it! -Service was cordial-friendly -Our food arrived timely -Our Ticket/Tab was a bit too slow. We had to wave on one of the servers to finally bring it to us.  Overall, we had a lovely time. Yes. We are returning again! :)"}
{"text":"NOT ALL THAT...  We were, of course, excited to be eating at Gordon Ramsay's famed restaurant after having seen many of his programs and knowing the high standards he has, at least on his TV shows.  The hostesses in the front were very pleasant and professional, although their polyester cheerleading-esque uniforms were both strange and curious.  They seated us at a table after a 35-minute wait, after assuring us that this was short compared to most nights.  Once seated, it took our server quite a while to greet our table.  When he arrived he quickly dropped off an iPad, and rushed away to another table.  He didn't offer us water.    When he finally returned, we ordered an American Burger and Just Fries to share.  The burger was kind of average tasting and a little economical on the meat portion.  The bun was a bit too bready. The $9 fries, however, were really a bummer.  They were dry, luke-warm and overcooked.  We tried to dip them in the sauces provided but that didn't help.  The sauces themselves were overly complicated and uncomplimentary.  Our server did not return on his own to check on our meal.  We had to flag him down, to ask for a side of mayo, in one last attempt to salvage the fries.  The back waiter returned with two ramekins: one with mayo and one with a truffle aioli.   We tried dipping the fries in both of the sauces.  Unfortunately, they couldn't hide the dry and overall sad texture.    We gave our waiter the feedback on the fries, just so the kitchen could know.  He said he would take them off the bill, but that we \"should've told him\" and he \"could have sent out fresh fries\".  I have two issues with this: 1. A Gordon Ramsay kitchen should never send out stale fries. Customers expect fresh, consistent food. 2. A server should always simply apologize and ask what else s/he can do to make things better.    Our server made a cursory apology but his tone suggested he wasn't sorry at all, and moreover, that we were somehow at fault.  He didn't ask us if we wanted dessert.  He dropped off the check without  saying \"thank you\".  He only said \"here you go\".  It would have been so nice to hear \"I am very again sorry about the fries. Would you like some dessert on us?\" But, he missed that opportunity.  We were truly disappointed and surprised that BURGR doesn't have better trained staff and  excellent and consistent food.  I don't think Chef Ramsay would have been happy with our meal."}
{"text":"We decided to try this for lunch on a Wednesday and only had about a 30 min wait which was nice considering how long the line was.  It was definitely worth the wait.  I am 99.9% sure this was the best burger I've ever had in my life.  I ordered the Britannia burger and it was the most amazing, flavorful and juicy burger ever.  I ordered fries which were nicely done - crispy but not overdone.  We shared the Jalapeno poppers - six on a plate, each in their own individual ramekin with sauce.  One is supposed to still have seeds - ours had two and I happen to pull both of them!     I highly recommend for a great, reasonably priced burger on the Strip.    Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I may be a foodie, but when it come to Ramsay, this is as far as I go.  I should clarify that this is how far down I'll go on my standards knowing how he really is with his food.  I've tried his beef wellington and even after years, I still know the texture and taste of that delicious goodness along with his sticky toffee pudding and ice cream that blows Ben & Jerry or Haagen Dazs out of the water at his other restaurant.  I was sure disappointed about this place.  My family and I each had something different: the soba noodle dish, burger, and chicken burger along with the toffee pudding push pop.  The soba noodle had nothing too special about it except for the chicken, the burger my brother had was bland, and the chicken burger the waitress so absolutely gloated about with interesting flavors, was a huge disappointment.  After that one bite of the chicken burger from her description, I was bummed and didn't even finish it.  The truffle fries was nothing too special either.  Honestly, I would have preferred McDonald's french fries over this!!!  I think the only thing I actually enjoyed was the sauce they normally have on their wings, but for my fries.  You know the restaurant is bad when you like the sauce of all things they have to offer.    This place didn't justify the 45 minutes wait along with mediocre service.  I think I was the only person wanting to watch hockey in that place since my visit was during the Stanley Cups (just shows how disinterested I was in the food) and of all the TV screens on, they couldn't do it.  The manager exclaimed, \"Who watches hockey out here?\" and proceeds to make a joke about the Cubs.  Hmmm, lets just say that burning flame display in the front was a great indication of my mood for me that night.  This is another concept of Food Network chef's I'll scratch out from ever coming in along with Border Grill at Mandalay Bay.     Bottom line: Save your money and your time from this place and invest it for his more upscale restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing shakes however my burger and soba noodle salad were disappointing - lacked any kind of flavor.  I had a few bites but couldn't finish either one.  I just spent way too much on mediocre food.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ggreat burgers, cocktails, and ice cream treats.  And fun staff.  Would go back!"}
{"text":"Perfection! The only thing I would change is the volume of the music.  But at lunch time, it's tolerable."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if the long line was going to be worth it but it is.  Everyone is super friendly,  helpful and that wasn't the best part.  As a burger eating person I can tell you it was the best burger I've ever had.   Juicy, flavorful and absolutely perfect.  I had a shake and it was just as amazing.  Then you add fries and you couldn't ask for a better meal.  Powered sugar on fries was strange but everything went perfectly together.  Say what you want about Gordon Ramsay but he's a genius."}
{"text":"So before I begin let me be honest I am a HUGE Gordon Ramsay fan I was very excited to visit this restaurant and let me say it DID NOT disappoint!   The service was awesome and there was a brief survey to complete after your meal. I love the idea of the on the spot survey. It holds everyone accountable to provide customers with their absolute best and that was what they did.   The hostess was friendly, the waiter (Elijah) was AmazeBalls and he even had a team member assist him! The American cheeseburger was really good and was full of flavor. Anytime I'm in Vegas this is a \"Must\"."}
{"text":"Have been to this place three times now and have enjoyed it each time. We started with the poppers which are amazing. I had the fresh chili dawg which was wonderful and huge. My dad order the fish sandwich which was equally as good. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Onion rings were good. Truffle burger was eh. IMO, Umami Burger is a lot better."}
{"text":"For a Gordan Ramsay restaurant, it was just average. My family ordered the most popular Farm Burger (duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar, fried egg, and a monstrous medium rare patty) and truffle fries to share. I have to admit the presentation of the food was nice and the servers were very nice and attentive. But the food was on the salty side.   Sorry, Gordon, but I won't be back for the burgers. But I do wanna give the milkshakes a try!"}
{"text":"I had the Euro Burger, fantastic! Best burger I've had in a long time.  You could taste every element of the burger. The fries were not my favorite,  although real potatoes, they were very dry."}
{"text":"Gave it a second chance...over priced burgers lacking in debth, flavor and taste.  Good service, but you can pass on this mediocre burger bar, nothing special, except for the fire decor outside the restaurant.  Fish burger was greasy, no flavor and lacked total flavor, fries ok, how can you mess up fried potatoes. Other's ordered various mediocre burgers - meh..they said In and Out is better - wow...had the portobello burger last time, ok..nothing special...keep walking by...Do better Gordon, this place needs an overhaul or restaurant makeover by Robert Irvine!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger place for the price range ( I like Stripburger which is about 1/2 the price but not as good). I have been five or 6 times and tried quite a few things from the menu, but here are my favorites\"  Chicken Slider App- if you like chic-fil-a and appreciate a good chicken sandwhich I would try this. It is really flavorful chicken and comes with a good sriacha flavored mayo that is pretty amazing. You get 2 in an order.   Farm burger- I don't even know what duck bacon is, how it is made, or if it is even really a thing. What I do know is that it is delicious. Any burger with a fried egg is generally what I gravitate towards at a burger place and this egg was perfect- \"Breaking the yoke is the customer's pleasure\"- true words Gordon.  Truffle Parmesan Fries- comes with a great aoli- make sure whatever fries you get that you get all the dipping sauces to try them. I usually get sweet potato fries, and the ones here are great- but these are slightly better imo.The sweet potato fries come with a shaker of vanilla powdered sugar and while it is totally out of character for me I find it to be a bit much- every time I see someone shake that thing I hear Wilford Brimley in my head saying \"dia-beet-us\". Good in small doses, not a whole order.   If that isn't your ideal meal, here are some other good items  Jalapeno poppers- the star here is the sauce they come in which is delicious and creamy. I think many people don't read the menu but you get like 7 poppers, 6 are mild and 1 is much spicier - they don't tell you which is the spicy one so proceede with caution if you don't like spice.   Pig Bao Buns- these are great and only barely edged out by the chicken sliders.   Britania burger- the mangu chutney on this makes it super awesome. I would advice requesting they go easy on the arugula though.   Blue Burger- when they say blue cheese they aren't kidding- you get a healthy slab of it here not little crumbles- that can be good or bad depending on how much chest hair you have.    A few people have dinged the service- and yes the service is not on park with GR Steak- but its a burger place. The service is commensurate with the restaurant design. I will say the waitresses, while generally quite attractive, have to wear perhaps the most unattractive uniforms I have ever seen.  There is generally going to be a long wait during peak hours- this place is really popular and many out of towners want to go because they are GR fans. They will take your name and text you when your table is ready so there is no range restriction- go check out the Miracle Mile shops or walk around on the strip to kill time."}
{"text":"This place isn't all that great. Was able to try after a long family vacation in a mansion rental. My guest and I were dropped off at the strip around breakfast time to find stuff to do before we had to head to the airport. It was almost 11 when we saw this cool burger joint with a fire-lit sign. Enticed by the fact that it was Gordon Ramsay's (asshole from Kitchen Nightmares) restaurant, i thought to myself, \"i have to try this place.\" Unfortunately there is this giant picture of him, luckily my back faced it.   My guest and I asked for our patties to be prepared differently. When the burgers came out, half way into eating, we realized that they were mixed up! Ugh -- i actually enjoyed my mistake, but my guest did not. That's a pretty big mistake on the restaurant's end. The burgers weren't all that special anyway.  Maybe this place could be a late night drunk spot, but i don't see the hype. Yay for Vegas in general!"}
{"text":"The wait for this place was ridiculously long. I had to wait about 45 minutes just to be seated, then I have to wait another 40 minutes for my order. I ordered the Farm Burger, Truffle Parmesan Fries, and sweet potato fries. The house ketchup for the truffle parmesan fries was delicious! The farm burger was good but I expected more flavor. The sweet potato fries and their dipping sauce was great!"}
{"text":"There's a reason why there is a wait. It is totally worth it. The quality of food is amazing. I had the euro burger with sweet potato fries and the truffle fries. A for sure stop now every time I'm in town. Servers were really knowledgable of the menu."}
{"text":"Great restraunt. I had the Earth burgr and the flavors were exploding! My husband had the Euro burgr which was perfectly cooked medium. The Parmasean Truffle fries amazingly delicious. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Burger was good! Stay away from the fries. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger. Fries were old , i mean, time the fries to come out with the burger! This shouldn't be hard. For the price, it was good, but save some money and skip the fries."}
{"text":"The burgers were sexmazing , I would recommend this place for the burger connoisseur , start off with the wings they were fantastic."}
{"text":"The chicken burger was very good - the highlight of the meal (along with the house made ketchup). Fries were a little too rich (really, you need truffle oil and Parmesan on a deep fried food?). Farm burger was cooked to my liking (medium) and the duck bacon was tasty (although not crispy enough - the burger needed some different textures). They also committed a cardinal sin: overcooking the fried egg on the farm burger. The yoke was nearly solid when it should have been runny. Overall an okay meal and a good draft beer selection for those who prefer craft style brews but nothing to suggest that burgers are their specialty."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Waited in line for 20 minutes, which I thought took days! But it was all worth it! Our waitress was very friendly and prompt. Hell's Kitchen Burger was exceptional! What did it for me were the Jalapeno Poppers & the Creme Brulee Oreo Shake. Absolutely delicious! Everything from the burger to the ketchup had a unique taste to it. For a food lover like me, this is definitely a must have!"}
{"text":"First off, the address for Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is incorrect on this page. It is not in Caesars Palace, it is in Planet Hollywood!  Anyway, BurGR is always very packed in high clientele so it is obviously a popular place to eat. During my visit with my boyfriend, we ordered the honey pig bao bun and we both ordered the farm burger and the \"just fries\".   The hone pig bao bun was okay, the bun's texture wasn't the best I have tried, it would get stuck in my teeth, which is irritating. Overall, they were okay. We were both very excited to try the farm burger because all of the pictures we saw made it look amazing, plus when they finally had it served to us, it looked delicious. Well, as we ate it, we both thought that there was something missing... Overall the burger was okay, we both have had better.. The \"just fries\" were only okay as well.. The texture was so weird, it was like a rubbery texture, which didn't feel right as we ate them.  Overall, BurGR is okay. I apologize Gordon Ramsay, but it's a great concept you have going on at this restaurant, the food just isn't at the tip of the tea amazing. It was a good experience, but I don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Reviews and pictures for this place looked amazing so we decided to order take out from this location (and very convenient since we were staying at Planet Hollywood. it's in the casino).  You can only place takeout orders in person so we did. The hostesses were SUPER nice and accommodating. Even with a long line of people.  Picked up our food after 20 min. Burgers were sadly mediocre. I didn't get that wow factor. Just your standard burger with fancy ingrediants. Got the Farm Burger with Duck bacon and fried egg.  The parm truffle fries were pretty good. LOVED the truffle aioli dipping sauce. My fav part of the whole meal.  For the amount of money we spent, I woudln't get a burger from here again."}
{"text":"Best Burger Place In Vegas!! I had been wanting to try one of Chef Ramsay's Restaurants, so we all decided to try this place for lunch. We were not disappointed.   We put our name on the wait list and decided to walk around and play the slot machines in Planet Hollywood while we waited. Time flew by and about 30 minutes later they were calling us to go back because they had a table ready for us. It was a busy and the staff and our waiter was really nice.   I decided to try the Hell's Kitchen Burger and I was not disappointed. The presentation was amazing. Never had I tried a burger that looked exactly like it did in the picture. The burger itself was AMAZING! I also ordered fries and those were great as well.   I think the food is reasonably priced for the portions you're getting and the quality of food, but it also depends on how much you're looking  to spend. As for myself, I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!!! Onion rings are the best I've ever tried! OMG I can't get over how good they were! Farm burger is what I got and it was \"nummmmmmy\""}
{"text":"Was with a big group so was kind of loud not really a good place to be with if you want to chat and catch up. Other than that place was pretty neat. Good was fill of flavor and loved the curry ketchup with the fries.   I had the hella kitchen burger. Medium well and loved the taste of the meat. :) I'll be back again.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the servers. I really couldn't understand them since it was loud and they topped off  my Sierra mist with water and didn't ask if it was soda or water."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little small and it's in the middle of a shopping mall.  It has kind of a food court atmosphere.  But sit down and order some food and you will forget all about that.  The food is simply incredible.  The waiter was extremely helpful and knew the menu inside and out - then again, it is primarily burgers and fries.  But he gave great advice and then gave us time to decide.  The truffle fries are more than enough for two people.  We didn't even finish them.  They might be enough for three.  They taste amazing but do get a bit overpowering after a while.  The handmade mayonnaise dipping sauce was awesome.  But the burgers were simply amazing.  Mouthwatering beef with incredible toppings and sauces.  Wife and I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Euro and then split them so we each got half.  Both were incredible - the cheeses, the peppers, the aioli sauce, everything was amazing quality and flavor.  It was the best meal I had in Vegas hands down and it was just lunch.  I was in Vegas for 5 days on business.  I felt like I was being ripped off and gouged everywhere I went.  There were 2 restaurants all week that I felt like I got my money's worth and this was one of them; not because they were cheap, but because the food was so delicious.  For 2 burgers, 1 order of fries and 2 beers, we spent over $75. It was worth every penny.  If you like hamburgers at all, this place is a must."}
{"text":"Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una urbe oscura, ché la diritta via era smarrita.  Ahi quanto a dir qual era è cosa dura esta urbe selvaggia e guasta e forte che nel pensier rinova la paura!  Tant' è amara che poco è più morte; ma per trattar del ben ch'i' vi trovai, dirò de l'altre cose ch'i' v'ho scorte.  Io non so ben ridir com' i' v'intrai, tant' ero pien d'inedia a quel punto che la verace via assecondai.  Ma poi ch'i' fui al piè d'una filza giunto, là dove terminava quella marcia che m'avea d'inedia il cor compunto,  guardai in basso e vidi la Sua ciccia ben spesa si parlò de la moneta or che ammanita era per ogne faccia.  Allor fu l'inedia così queta, che nel buzzo altro non s'infilava la notte ch'i' passai con tanta pieta.  E ventraia di quei con me scoppiava, niun potè dar fine de la pappata, si volge il soldo a la serva grava,  la mensa prontata de tartufo e patata, pago lasciò lo mio giudizio che la quinta stella non è mancata."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Burgers are amazing. Fries are delicious. You HAVE to try their wings, they are fantastic. I always make sure to stop by before I leave Vegas"}
{"text":"I am a huge Chef Gordon Ramsey fan, so naturally I was excited to eat here. The wait was very long. Service was 3.5 out of 5. The food was a s solid 3. The dessert was a 4. Although I feel like I'm committing treason, I can't give them higher than a 3.5 because the burger wasn't the best I had during my stay and the server seemed a little bothered by my visit."}
{"text":"Burger was good, didn't take long but I have to say there seems to be little interest in service besides what would you like next! It's average that's it"}
{"text":"Mostly hype. The meat tastes like a buffalo meat mixture. None the less the other ingredients were high quality. The duck bacon was a nice touch. I really appreciated that they tried to do some things with the masala and chipotle ketchup. The service was not great at the bar and everyone wears  uniforms from the baby gap."}
{"text":"What can I add to 400 reviews of a place that is busy all the time?  I'll just give a bit from our experience.  Everything was just about perfect from the service to the food except for my hamburger.  I ordered the \"Über Cheeseburger\" medium.  The hamburger came out well done.  It wasn't just well done, it was really well done (you know what I mean), and it pretty much ruined the taste.  The hamburger ended up being good and bad - there were parts that were pretty flavorless and there were parts that were pretty good due to the selection of cheeses.  The truffle parmesan fries were excellent and kept the overall rating at four stars.  I probably won't be back; I mean, I've only spent two nights in Vegas in my life and there are so many places to try, but if it were close to home, this would be a regular destination."}
{"text":"VISIT! ASAP! ... and let me know which is better: their service or their food.  A group of girls and I got lucky and only had to wait 45 minutes for a table (and this was on a Saturday night). Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and he had a great attitude, very patient. We loved the interactive menu on the iPad that showed pictures of the drinks and merchandise for sale.  I don't know where to start with reviewing the food... We ordered the sweet potato and truffle Parmesan fries. The sauces that came with them were a perfect pairing. My one friend and I shared the Euro and Chanterelle Burgers. I don't want to talk about them; they were that good."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. I was so excited to try the Famous Gordon Ramsay Burgr. There was a small line to get in the restaurant that was moving very slowly. Lucky for me I am a platinum member. Which means I get to go in front of the line. Went with another couple and they were super excited as well. Our server was very patient and friendly. Burgers were a decent size but none of us finish our burger because we had all regret coming her. We  all agree In N out was much tastier. Fries were stale and over cooked. Bill ended up to be around $70 bucks. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Pros: Very professional service, great onion rings, very good burgers and the best milk shake you will ever have.  Cons: They don't take reservations so expect about a 30-minute wait for dinner.  Whatever you do make sure you save room for one of their milk shakes -- either as an appetizer or better yet, as dessert.  Perhaps the greatest dessert I've ever had in my life.  The onion rings are also top notch and the Bleu Burger was outstanding."}
{"text":"Get the Euro Burger - goat cheese, arugula & truffle aioli - simple, but delicious! Absolutely loved it and will be back to order again.  The onions rings were large, but had too much batter. The parmesan truffle fries were overcooked, but the truffle aioli dipping sauce was to die!  Was too full. I wanted to order a yummy looking shake, but would not be able to conquer.   We checked in at around 1pm on a Friday and we were told it was an hour wait. They took our number and said they would text us. Cool, so we can walk around and shop in Planet Hollywood or gamble. 20 minutes later, they paged us. Awesome!   The place is not that big, which is why the wait is probably long for some. I thought it was worth it though. Service was also awesome. Glad I got to try it."}
{"text":"Looking for a burger? Look no further! I was searching for a burger joint that would satisfy my craving while in Vegas and this fit the bill.  Located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel, the flames encircling the restaurant in the glass display really caught my eye.  We had a brief 10-15 minute wait and dined in for 2 people.  Our server was attentive and cheery.  I ordered the Euro Burger with avocado and had it as is (no substitutions) medium well.  My boyfriend had the Hell's Kitchen burger.  We ordered a just fries to share.  Our server brought us a little assortment of dipping sauces upon request which were delicious!  I enjoyed my burger greatly.  The truffle aioli and goat cheese were perfectly complimenting each other and the burger and the avocado was also a great addition.  I highly recommend this place.  The rest of the menu items also look wonderful.  Can't wait to return on my next trip here!"}
{"text":"Ok..this place has some crazy burger ideas. Mine had bacon made from a rabbit..and all i can say is these burgers are delicious..about the best ive had.service wasnt stellar but the food was worth the wait"}
{"text":"Came in for the Sticky Toffee Pudding Pops, they weren't bad, but definitely too sweet for my taste, especially when you get to the bottom. The salted caramel was great though. The service is awful (luckily my friends and I bypassed the lines and went up to the bar to get our order), but there were a number of seriously disgruntled patrons waiting in line. One couple ended up cursing at the hostesses (there were 5 of them standing there, a fourth of the restaurant was empty, and a huge line was piling up outside), and then stomping out."}
{"text":"Very tasty - I had the Turkey Burger (juicy  turkey breast, no ground dry stuff in here) and the Parmesan Truffle FRIES and the Sweet Potato FRIES (my favorite of the two, and I usually hate sweet stuff).   The portions are generous and apparently their hotdogs are monstrous.  The staff is quick and friendly.  We got a great view of the Bellagio fountains by sitting near the entrance at a high top table.  Plus the wall of the restaurant is on  fire!"}
{"text":"The food is five stars.  Easy.  Order anything on the menu (order everything on the menu), and unless you are a vegetarian who somehow ordered a meat burger, you will likely not be disappointed.  I'd suggest splitting a shake because that is an awful lot of sweetness with the pudding and ice cream and milk shakey stuff, but it's great if you're feeling decadent.  Which you do, because you're in Vegas.  What I had to remove points for was the service, which was slow as hell.  We had to wait about 30-45 minutes for our burgers, which is pretty damn unacceptable.  There's also likely to be a line in front, but that's more understandable.  Was it worth the wait?  I'm honestly not sure because it got really, really annoying.  I've seen Hell's Kitchen, I know how Ramsay would react to the food taking this long.  Recommended: Fuckn burgrs, obviously.  + Fries + Milk Shake."}
{"text":"Yelp challenge 2016 (78/100)  Being a TR member has its perks and we got to skip the long line hehe. I actually liked BURGR. It's definitely a pretty expensive meal. I wouldn't say it's worth the price but it was worth the try.   SHAKE #4.. Oreo with creme brûlée pudding on top was pretty bomb. Our server recommended the Hog burger, which was like a pulled pork and I really liked that one. My friend got the Truffle burger, which seemed a little too basic for me. It wasn't all that bad. We topped it off the the Truffle Parm fries. Those could've been crispier  I'd want to come back some other time if I'm really craving it.   Recommendations: Shake #4 and the Hog burger"}
{"text":"Vegas is not my favorite place in the world, but it's a convenient stopover on long driving trips. I was looking for good food that is still as family friendly as you can get here.    BurGR is spot on food wise. Interesting variety, tasted great, not pricey.  Beer selection was a little lacking, but I still managed to order!  Service was great, but the waitresses uniforms were awful. I know it's Vegas, but I have been to plenty of other restaurants here that didn't resort to their servers wearing such minuscule dresses. And here's where it ruined my dinner. I could not stop thinking about what had to be happening in these women's lives to make them take a job where they were so horribly objectified.  If Gordon Ramsey was going to go this far he might as well have them wear cow dresses with the price of different cuts of meat on them. I expect the dehumanization of people when I'm in a casino or outside, but not while I'm eating a burger."}
{"text":"Everyone in our group had different burgers and there was not one unsatisfied soul despite our high expectations. All-round verdict was that the burgers were beefy, just like how a burger should taste. Sure beats In-n-Out Burger... don't think I'll be going to in-n-out anymore...  Parties of three or more can leave their number and get a text message when their table is ready, which I thought was pretty neat as we could just walk around the PH casino. Parties of two have to stay in line but line looked like it moved pretty quick."}
{"text":"Attention spicy food lovers! Order the Hell's Kitchen Burger with two types of peppers, cheese and other ingredients that will spice up your Las Vegas trip! This is a must for burger lovers and Ramsay fans. The line is worth it so don't be discouraged.   It's well worth the wait and it will cost a few bucks more than a traditional burger but go for the experience."}
{"text":"Design/Architecture and location is great but what's with the ketchup? Some strange sauces. Had a hard time eating the \"Just Fries\""}
{"text":"I've been here twice; the food and service are fantastic. Always get the jalapeño poppers!! My acai lemonade was a bit too sweet this time but everything is so good here. We tried the hot dog this time; best hot dog I've ever had."}
{"text":"I wish this burger was more memorable. We ate here in may when they had a military 2 for 1 burger promotion so we took advantage of that. They didn't advertise it really, it was just on the website at the very bottom.   One thing I loved about all three Gordon Ramsay establishments while I was in Vegas this weekend was the Innis and Gunn beer selection on tap. Here they had a stout (a porter at Steam, and a pale ale at Pub&grill). They are oak aged beers and taste awesome. Apparently the server said they were Gordon's fav beers (at least on the menu)and I can see why.     I did enjoy my burger just didn't blow me away for some reason. I had the euro which was tasty and cooked well. The truffle fries and dipping sauces were very good. Wish I was hungry enough for a shake but too full since this was our third stop on our Gordon Ramsay crawl of the strip."}
{"text":"Was excited to go here since it's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, and it's affordable. The burgers were just okay. Server was nice, but be prepared to wait for a loooonnnnggg time for everything.   THE WAIT to get a table, and to get your food is LONG. I don't know what the wait is about outside the resto, but just go straight to the check-in table to give your cellphone number, and they'll text you if your table is ready. That helps so you can go around the shops while waiting.   Boyfriend and I had the HOG BURGER. It was juicy. It was good. But it's not the best gourmet burger I had.   We also shared the HONEY PIG BAO BUNS. I liked it, but Bachi Burger has better tasting ones.   We had the PARMESAN FRIES, which is good. I liked it.   My friend had HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER. He liked it, but his mouth was on fire.   His brother had the farm burger, and he wasn't impressed. He was pretty disappointed.   For waiting this long and getting \"okay\" gourmet burger, I'm not sure if I'll be back, unless I'm with a friend who really wants to try it. I might change my mind if I want to try their desserts, which has good reviews. Go to Bachi Burger (off the strip) or Holsteins (in Cosmopolitan) instead."}
{"text":"The worst part about BurGR is the wait, but it is worth it to give them your cell number & be texted when your table is ready so you can walk around until then. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which was delicious & my husband loved his as well. We also could not believe how good the truffle fries were!"}
{"text":"Since my first visit a year ago, I've been dreaming about my return to BurGR. I'm happy to say the burger was absolutely amazing and just as good as I remembered.   Here's what you need to know:   Line: there will be a wait. Get over it. Is amazing. Put your name on the list and hang around in Planet Hollywood. They'll text you when your seat is ready.   Food: get a burger. Any burger will do, but the Hell's Kitchen burger and the farm burger are amazing. The farm has duck bacon and a perfectly cooked egg.   Service: it can be slow, but it's usually because they are so busy. They keep the drinks full, but just like any other Vegas restaurant they don't like to split checks.   Just as with any other Harrahs property, show your total rewards card to save a bit of money.   Go. Eat a burger. Enjoy the deliciousness."}
{"text":"Menu looks great but food flavor is bland.  Honey-pig bao buns were bland and so was Hog Burger.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Farm Burger was good. The duck-breast bacon added good flavor but it was not crispy, which I'm guessing has something to do with it being duck-breast based. The burger itself was cooked well and had good flavor. Parmesan fries were good and crispy and served with a very tasty garlic aioli. It was a little pricey but I would go back to try one of the hot dogs."}
{"text":"Wow. I typically avoid meat, fried foods and soda but hey, it's Vegas and my bday so my hubby and I decided to splurge dietarily and hit this Burgr joint before heading out to the Strip. Only negative was the wait...if you have a players card or whatever you get right in but it wasn't that bad.   Once seated though we had a great server who took our order. Someone else brings out the food but our super busy server came by several times to check on us and refill my h's iced tea.   We ordered an order of ridiculously delish onion rings. Yum. Highly recommended Also a Dr Brown's Root Beer surprisingly distributed by Canada Dry.   Next up were the burgers. I ordered the blue cheese burger which was served on what had to be a homemade bun...light and seeded, it made the meal perfect. The burger was also delicious. Garnished with some arugula it was a simple dish elevated by the bun!!  My husband ordered the American burger and he said it was excellent.   The piece d' resistance however was the coconut pudding strawberry shake dessert which was seriously creative and extraordinary. Topped with a lovely spoonful of whipped cream and a chocolate cookie. So good.   The only odd thing here was what was on the tvs that surround the eating area. We were cool with basketball and hockey but there was this strange infomercial for some skin airbrush mechanism. It ran the entire time. No comprende.   Overall this was an outstanding dining experience and the food was excellent.   Highly recommend.     Nex"}
{"text":"Great bar service here, Raul and Jeff were awesome. Recommendations on point, a must eat place. Everything was delicious....and it was nice to see people \"doing there job.\" Burgr seemed to be a well oiled machine with a staff that looked happy. I loved the modern text when your seating is ready set up instead of the 1990's pager lol.... This was one stop ill definitely make every time I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Food was delicious. Service awesome. Brandon was attentive, friendly and quick. Overall a really great dining experience in the Vegas. Best place to eat for sure!!!!! Reasonably priced and portions were perfect size. Sides are not included which is the only downfall. Fries were delicious and perfect size to share."}
{"text":"This was by far the best burger I have ever had. We had the euro burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger. Both were made to perfection! So tasty and an abundance of flavors!!! We had the parmasean fries which were sooooo delicious. The truffle aoli was amazing. We also had the cherry whiskey lemonade. The drink was  strong and full of flavor. We will be back here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey doing burgers in Vegas! Decided to check it out and wasn't disappointed. There is a line, but the wait goes pretty quick. You can get a drink while waiting in line.   The line is next to a flame of Gordon Ramsey so this makes standing in line uncomfortable because of all the heat coming off.   Got the farm burger, I ordered it mw but came rare. The burger tasted great, the egg was perfect and the duck bacon was crisp. Perfect burger with excellent flavor.   The fries were standard with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup, both were excellent and different. The fries didn't stand out, but the ketchup gave them a boost.   Toffee cake push pops were an awesome after dinner treat. They had perfect flavor and the cake was moist.   They have a pretty good selection of beer. Try the angry bastard, an excellent choice with a burger. The Stella Artois was another great choice.   Would definitely go back if in Vegas."}
{"text":"Waited in line for ~30 minutes but it was worth it because the boyfriend and I are huge fans of Master Chef and Hell's Kitchen. The exterior already attracted us and the ambiance of the restaurant is definitely upscale. Immediately after we were seated down we noticed the extreme detailing of this place. Everything looked so pretty! Our server was also friendly (even though he took forever to bring our drinks).   We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was pretty good. The flavors were well-balanced. As Gordon Ramsay would say, \"the burger brings a lot of heat, it's got a nice kick to it!\" However, we wanted medium-well but that wasn't what we really got. We also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries and that was delicious. The sauces that we were given were unique-tasting, MUST TRY!   Overall, Gordon Ramsay Burgr met the standards of what a burger should taste like, but nothing stood out or was spectacular. We would like to return again though to try their other burgers or the devil dawgs."}
{"text":"Good food: The burgers are good.  They lack sauce though (even the BBQ one).  The fries are even better.  Know that the fries should be shared 1 per 3 people. Bad food: Service: A-, the service was great.  He told us about each burger and recommended one to each of us working with our some vegetarian, some no-beef requests. Ambiance: A-, nice looking place.  They have a really nice wall of fire, that actually doesn't heat up the place.  The only bad part is that the restaurant is in a casino. Price: $$$, For a cheaper alternative, just go to The Counter."}
{"text":"Incredible. From start until end my son and I were living the food and presentation. We got strawberry and orem shakes and both were great and massive. Jalepeno poppers were great. The sweet potato fries were also very good and a huge portion. My son got the farm burger and really liked it. I had hello kitchen burger and it was also great. Only downside was that I was stuffed from the shake, poppers, and fries by the time the burgers came. Easily could have fed four people."}
{"text":"Guy our server was great shared the Ramsey burger it was delicious!  Worth the trip! Be sure to get some malt vinegar for your fries.  Fries were a little soggy but still delicious!"}
{"text":"Sunman here with Reiki Gal in Las Vegas.  We wanted to try Gordon Ramsey's burger place as we are big fans of Gordon.  We had two bad experiences at Guy Fieri's place and hoped Gordon's would be better, turned out not to be so!.  We walked in about 1:30pm on Tuesday, May 24, 2016.  No line or waiting, we got seated right away by a most accommodating hostess. The chairs were really short and not terribly comfortable. First thing we noticed was the excessive noise level...over the top!  It was impossible to have a conversation with one another.   Place was only 2/3 full.  Menu is on folded cardboard sheet which held the napkin and utensils-clever!  We shared each others burgers.  She ordered the Hell burger which she requested to have the aioli served on the side.  I ordered the Blue Burger medium rare and requested sautéed mushrooms and onions to personalize my burger.  Food was delivered 40 minutes later. My burger was flawless.  We shared an order of sweet potato fries that we had requested to leave off the maple sugar dusting.  Reiki Gal's burger was prepared well though the aioli was blobbed on the bun.  The avocado chunks were not evenly spread over the burger nor were the roasted tomatoes or roasted jalapenos.  She likes a taste of everything in a bite.  The sweet potato fries came with...you guessed it!  They were dusted with the maple sugar.  The hell burger was too spicy hot for her and me. I took only one bite and gave it back to her.  We both had ice tea.  The fries were too big, half an order would have been plenty. A neighboring table had ordered jalapeno poppers which were served in individual shot glasses with ranch dressing.  They left two making us wish that they had been our new best friends and were willing to share.  They also left their sweet potato fries and truffle fries.  Gordon knows one of the best blue cheeses is Stilton...so why did he have them use Maytag blue?  I would have been more impressed if he had used English stilton.  We will not return to Gordon's BurGR, but we are glad we tried it once."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service!! Everything we ordered came out looking like a work of art as well as some darn tasty drinks!! Bring your appetite and your patience cause it took us 45 minutes to get in which we expected.  All in all Gordon earned every bit of the 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"We've visited Ramsay BurGR enough times to say it's consistently good.  After trying a few varieties of their burgers, my favorite is still the Britannia, because the mango chutney is an interesting complement to the rest of the sandwich.  The fries aren't always uniformly good throughout the basket, but enough of them are tasty that it's worth discarding a few squishy ones, and the two different dipping sauces are so much better than plain ketchup or mayo.  They have many drinks to choose from, so it's fun to pick out a new one each time.  We've been lucky on the service so far - during our last visit the waiter took the time to share a few ideas for which beer was good (we went with his recommendation of Magic Hat beer). They also have a practical system that lets any passing waiter at the chef's counter pick up an order and bring it out to the table so it doesn't get cold if our assigned waiter can't get to it right away.  There's usually a long line to get in, and we've been surprised a couple times to find more than a few empty tables when we're seated. Are they intentionally trying to make this place harder to get into, or are the hostesses just a little disorganized?  I wouldn't recommend visiting with a large group. The wait is long enough as it is just for one or two people - bring more than that and you'll be waiting a good long while before you're seated.  The location is right off the casino floor, but we didn't smell any smoke while waiting in line. During the winter I always end up taking off my jacket while I'm in line, because the decorative flames in the front generate enough heat to stay warm.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Wait time: 20 minutes  (week day)  Staff was friendly. Like the fact that they're technological. waitress showed an Ipad to choose my drink? Fancy, indeed.  appetizer: Maui onion rings..Delish!  decided to put my taste buds on fire. I went with the hells fire burger? Nice bite , but I wouldve expected a lil more heat with it? I guess my tollerance for heat/hotness of peppers is high?   My friend sampled my burger, she said it was \"too hot\" for her. eh...wuss.   Overall, Not bad. I wouldnt make this a \"must\" dining experience  They needed our feedback on this service/food after we ate. I thought it was \"optional\"?  I guess not at this place.  so a restaurant finding its weakness'? bravo in improvement."}
{"text":"The jalapeño poppers were awesome! They come in their own individual shot glasses with dipping sauce! I wasn't crazy about the sweet potato fries but the Parmesan truffle fries went fast! :)"}
{"text":"Farm burger, Euro burger, and sweet potato fries served after 32 minutes of waiting, shake#4 served after 23 minutes of waiting, and brewed coffee came to our table about 5 minutes within placing the order. Overall, burgers were okay, sweet potato fries was good, shake#4 was surprisingly yum, and coffee tasted terrible."}
{"text":"I wud give BurGR a 10 star if I could. My husband I went there to see what the fuss was all about. My review is based on two things - Food and Overall Experience.   Food - I ordered their vegetarian (Mushroom Burger ) and my husband ordered their chicken burger along with their Parmesan Truffle Fries. The burger was huge but tasted good. The mushroom was cooked really well although overall it lacked the flavors i was actually looking forward to. The Parmesan Fries were really good!   Overall Experience - Here is why i would give these guys a 10 Star ! The que is ridiculous. So we thought maybe sitting by the bar may not be that bad an idea. However, we forgot that in December sitting by the door is not the best idea. We asked the hostess if she could move us. The lady we spoke wit initially could nto be bothered, but the lady we spoke to not only ensured we were comfortable wherever she put is but helped us make sure hot food was served to us at the new space. We went from sitting by the bar to sitting by the kitchen ! IT was amazing ! Watching the team do their thing... fantastic !   Highly Recommended - Sit by the Kitchen ! The Head chef is super sweet   All in all we loved the place and will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Overall had a great experience. Waited about 15 minutes for a table for 3. Our server was very attentive and took our order quickly. Burgers take 20 minutes to cook after you order just a heads up. I ordered the Britannia burger, which had arugula and a mango chutney. Omg. Great burger. Definitely top 3 burgers I've ever had. Also ordered the onion rings and truffle fries because of the high praise from other reviews. I though the rings and fries were decent but not out of this world. The house made ketchup on the other hand is amazing!! Definitely will be coming back again anytime I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Burnt burger. Undercooked hot dog. Burnt, broken, crispy fries.  Best milkshake of my life.  It should've been called mlkshake instead of BURGR."}
{"text":"I'm thinking about breaking up with Gordon over this debacle of a restaurant. And that says a lot because I love this man's restaurants.   You almost get the idea when you walk in that you're going to be disappointed. From the cheap looking outfits the girls wear, to the crowded, pushed together tables with everyone sitting on top of each other, you feel mediocrity permeating this place from the onset.   It seems such a weird thing to be eating here as I'm vegetarian, but they do have ONE option for me so I wasn't staring into space while my friends noshed on their burgrs. That's how you spell it, right? No? Okay, sorry.  First the service. If you were thinking this restaurant was on the mediocre side then the service would have you falling over into it. Completely unable to wait on more than one table at a time (both times I visited). My water glass the first time didn't even recognize its use as a water glass. The second time was a little better, but the waiter buzzed around like a robot barely talking. Apparently he was working on his multitasking. Also, how unsexy are jeans with the intials \"GR\" on the pocket? A little overboard on the vanity methinks.  I had the Earth Burgr (ha, I just love doing that) consisting of grilled portobello mushroom, fontina cheese, arugula and roasted tomato. The combo sounds good and it's fine, but not for $15. I mean, it's not even meat, it's a mushroom disguised as meat. That lessens the chance of me raving about it considerably. I like to get what I pay for or I lose the ability to rave about anything. The taste is fine, the bun is soft, the arugula is a nice touch, but it seriously is just OKAY.   Let's just get to the fries. I have never in my life tasted fries like this. I hated them. They are too big, they are too SOMETHING and it's not something that's positive. I had both the regular and the parmesan. Just no. The flavor is just wrong. I can't even really put my finger on why. I regret ever tasting these at all.   Now to dessert. Sigh. I was hoping that after just spending $80 on a meal prior to dessert that I would somehow be redeemed for that colossal wasting of money. HA! I'd be wrong! Ordered the sticky toffee pudding ice cream on a stick thing and wondered who in the hell I'd pissed off at this place. What a joke of a dessert. First, it's so obviously made ahead of time (it's frozen, so of course), but it tastes it. I'm not a fan. I can't even go on about it, it was just such a disappointment.   I've been to GR Steak and the GR at the London (NYC) and have come from both feeling like I would never taste better. I think GR is much better at gourmet then low brow burgers (yeah, I even got tired of it)."}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant I have been to. I haven't been to many fancy places, but that doesn't take away from the fact that the food here was amazing! My friend and I were in Vegas last weekend walking the strip and just happened to see it. There was a small line which was great but it was also 2am. We each got an IPA which was priced well at 8 bucks, and was also delicious. We started with the hummus, and let me tell you, I have had hummus everywhere and this was easily the best I've ever had. It came with bread and fresh grilled veggies both in butter and garlic salt and I never wanted to stop eating it. My friend ordered the Farm Burger which he said was fantastic and I got the Portobello Mushroom Burger, which I've never had before, but at this place is now my all-time favorite burger. I can't even explain how good it was. We also shared fries which were good. The server was fine, nothing amazing but he was very nice. It was expensive for burgers but it didn't matter because we were in Vegas and the food blew our minds. I will now go here every time I go to Vegas, and will try to find more Gordon Ramsay restaurants."}
{"text":"Utter disappointment and overpriced for a sub-par burger.  Wait - Looked very long when we were walking out but we went when it opened so it wasn't bad at all for our large group.   Truffle Fries - Meh, nothing special. We originally ordered 2 orders to share with our table of 6. However, after receiving 1 and trying it, we cancelled the 2nd because no one really liked it enough for 2 orders.  Farm Burger (Medium Rare) - Overdone. I sent it back TWICE. Twice!!!!! and it was STILL overdone (and no, I wasn't being anal, it was completely well done through and through both times). I just sighed and ate it because all my friends were done and I was still waiting for mine (and it was very obvious that my new burger order was sent to the BACK of the line). Nothing from the waiter to make up for their screw up or my wait. I had high expectations because it seemed like Gordon Ramsay held his kitchen staff to high standards on his show. Why isn't he here testing the meat and yelling at the staff!? They definitely need to be told that they're all incompetent nincompoops at this location!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Everything was great and I rarely eat hamburgers. Service was on point and fast, no fluff. Drink refills automatic. Had the euro burger and sweet potato fries. If you want a good burger and experience, go here. Expect long lines at night or make a reservation or go during off peak hours."}
{"text":"Oh. Em. Gee. Loved this place! The was a huge line, but they came to take our cell number, and texted us when there was a table ready, which was awesome. An hour wait, but we shopped in Miracle MIle while we waited, so no big deal.   The folks working at the front seemed a but snooty, but once we were sat all was well. Our server was friendly and genuine, which helped make the meal great. We started with the onion rings, which were perfect: fried and crispy without being greasy, good flavour, and topped with cheese. Yum! We all enjoyed our burgers a lot - I had the pork burger, and it may have been the best burger I've ever had. Fresh, tasty bun, great ingredients, perfectly cooked meat. Can't ask for more!   We paired our meal with their cider on tap, which was delicious and a great complement to the food, without being too heavy. Everything is made in house from the burgers themselves to the sauces - and it shows in the freshness and quality. Also, the price was certainly right. All round a great experience!! Will be on the list of places to go back on in Vegas for SURE."}
{"text":"A little overrated. The menu looks and sounds great but the food wasn't great. I ordered the fish and crisps. The fish didn't have the right seasoning and seemed bland. The sweet potato fries had powdered sugar which I didn't like. I also tried the Hell's Kitchen burger which was HOT!! My mouth was on fire!!   The service was great, the food came out quickly, and the prices were a little above average (then again, Vegas has overpriced food everywhere). I probably won't go back to this restaurant since I didn't love it."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The menu was very different and sounded delicious.  Although I know the flavors would have been amazing, they were a bit camouflaged due to the extreme salty flavoring in both mine and my boyfriend's burgers.  I would have liked the flavors of the cheese and sauce on my turkey burger to have taken precedence over the salt.  The Parmesan fries, though, were delicious."}
{"text":"It was good but not the best I had the duck burger but I did really taste the duck. The flavor profiles weren't their for my burger,  but my girlfriend had the all American burger which was good. The fries were the best out of my meal. It was overprice, basically you paying for Gordon Ramsey name."}
{"text":"Words can't describe this place and this review is gonna be tough to write because I'm pretty speechless haha long story short, go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR, like, right now! Haha  The Place - BurGR is located inside of Planet Hollywood and depending on what side of PH you enter in on, it could be pretty difficult to find.....or maybe my sense of directions is just absolutely horrible haha. Once I made my way around to the entrance of BurGR, I was surprised to see how open it is. The bar is a pretty decent size and located right next to the hostess stand. The decorations are very modern and urban and the big wall of fire is definitely something to take a picture of. I couldn't quite see the entire restaurant as I sat at the bar, but from what I saw, it's fairly well-sized and can fit any size party. The line and wait time to this place can get fairly long so try and make reservations, if possible. Luckily, I came to BurGR by myself on a Tuesday afternoon and there was open seating at the bar. REALLY great location and carries the theme well! You can definitely tell Gordon had a vision and he did a good job delivering! Great job, BurGR! *****5/5 Stars*****  The Service - The service is nothing short of amazing as well. I arrived at the hostess' station and, despite the long line they had, I was promptly greeted. Since I was by myself, I automatically assumed that the bar was open seating, but wanted to do my due diligence and ask anyways. I was greeted with a smile and after asking about the open seating, I was welcomed to the bar. I'm gonna go ahead and get this out of the way and, being in Vegas, it's almost expected. Sex sells...so with that being said, the hostesses and female waitresses are dressed to impress as well as with the guys, but tastefully done. When I sat at the bar, I was greeted, by not one, but two bartenders..and that wasn't because one bartender didn't know what the other one was doing, but because all the bartenders are very social and make sure you're well taken care of. For my visit, I both had Eric and LaLa serve me and they were nothing short of amazing, so shout out to them! THANKS GUYS!! *****5/5 Stars*****  The Food - My oh my...where do I begin?? The menu is so simple, but it's so darn delicious with all the unique burgers they offer, the sides they serve, and the delicious shakes they conjure up. I, unfortunately, did not get to try a shake, but I could've sworn the whole bar ordered the Shake #4 (Creme Brulee Pudding, Oreo Shake, topped with an Oreo cookie), so I'm assuming that's the shake to get. I decided to go with the Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings (See Picture). The rings were perfectly fried, the dusting of parmigiano-reggiano gave that rich, smooth flavor it needed, and to top it off, the Chipotle Ketchup provided just the right amount of kick to set it off. I'm a BIG fan of onion rings and these are probably the BEST I've had to date! Definitely recommended! Now, onto the main event haha....the burger. After seeing all the Yelp reviews and the majority of pics that everyone has posted, I decided to go with the Farm Burger (See Picture) and I'm soooooooo glad I did! The burger itself is grilled over Apple Wood and Older Wood and topped with Duck Breast Bacon (yes, Duck Breast), English Sharp Cheddar, and of course, a fried egg. They ask how you would like your burger cooked and I went with a medium well. The burger was cooked perfectly, had a savory flavory from the being grilled over the Apple and Older wood and juicy as a great burger should be. The duck breast bacon, although different, was absolutely delicious. It gave the burger that saltiness it needed while providing you with a different profile when compared to traditional pork bacon. It was my first time having duck breast bacon and, after sampling it on this burger, is something I'll definitely look for here on out. I cut the burger in half when I received it, and the fried egg's yolk cracked perfectly and distributed itself over the burger. If you never had a cracked yolk over a burger before, I HIGHLY suggest you start trying it and start with this one! Haha Excellent food, BurGR! Bravo! *****5/5 Stars*****  Overall - I think out of all the burger joints I've been to (and as a burger fanatic, I've been to a few), this has got to be one of the best burgers I've ever tasted, the best onion rings I've ever had, and one of the best services I've been a part of. I know there are some people out there with negative reviews of this place and it truly is a shame they didn't enjoy their experience because Gordon Ramsay BurGR is definitely one to have. Stop thinking about going already and just go! Hurry! Haha"}
{"text":"This is a very pretty burger restaurant and the portions are quite generous.  The fries are tasty and the sweet potato fries (with powdered sugar and an incredible dipping sauce) are delicious.  The burgers we ordered were quite tasty, but to be honest, far too rich for our blood.  My wife and I both ordered the same burger with egg and duck breast bacon (the Farm Burger) and, sadly, we each only ate half of our burgers - we should have shared one.  We ended up giving our leftovers to a homeless person on one of the bridges (they had a cat) and can only hope that they didn't experience the same rush to the bathrooms that my wife and I did.  Don't get me wrong, the food was great and flavorful, it was just too much for our systems."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, customer service, very good food for the money. Delicious burgers, not the greasy type from the fast food restaurants that give you a heartburn, but a very delicate, tasty, creative ones that leave you feeling full, yet not overloaded. Great beer selection as well."}
{"text":"I am OBSESSED with Gordon Ramsay. I love his insane television personality and I also love his recipes. I'm big into cooking and oftentimes when I'm food-shopping I hear myself thinking, \"Gordon Ramsay says _____ about this. Gordon Ramsay says ____ about that.\" I'm annoying to even myself.  That said, I really believe we may have come here on an off-day. Our fries were cold. I ordered the truffle burger. There was such little truffle flavor, I honestly thought I may have received the incorrect order. But I realized with the amount of frisee on it that it must be right. That's mostly what I tasted. My boyfriend got the farm burger, which was better. Unfortunately, mine was the more expensive one.  The restaurant itself also does little to obscure the fact that it's smack-dab in the center of a casino/mall, which may be intentional. I didn't really like it though. They also give you iPads for perusing the alcohol menu and ordering drinks. Our iPad didn't work very well, and it seemed gimmicky.  The good: the burgers were JUICY! Cooked to perfect temperature, and I liked the buns. The service was good too. Our waitress gave me the rest of my beer in a to-go cup, which blew my mind (only in Vegas, right?) and made me very happy.   It wasn't bad at all, just not really worth returning when there are 1 zillion other restaurants in Vegas to try. That said, I still love GR and when we come back in January we're going to try Fish & Chips for sure. Gordon Ramsay... you are my bab-ay."}
{"text":"I liked BurGR, but I didn't love it. I had the chanterelle burger, and it was good, but nothing super special. One of us had the farm and the other had the blue burger. We all sampled each others and I still liked mine for it's savory-sweet flavors.  I think I enjoyed the fires more than the burgers though. The truffle parmesan fries with garlic aioli was my fave. I also liked the jalapeno mayo that came with the sweet potato fries.   The sticky toffee pudding (in my profile picture) was also great. And it's good to share for 2!   Service was meh. They were slow to seat us even after they called us to say the table was ready. It's also pretty loud inside, but if that's your thing you may be fine with that.  Overall the food was fine, but I feel like I enjoyed our sides and dessert more than our burgers. And for a place that's called Burgr that's a little sad. I won't come back, but it may be worth it to try at least once.   Everything ordered above plus one root beer came out to about $80 with tax and tip. That's with our Total Rewards membership card! Make sure you get one to save a dollar on each menu item (it's literally around the corner to the right when you walk towards the casino area). It's free to join so why not?"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my bf because the truffle fries and pudding shakes were highly recommended to him.  We were not disappointed!  We also had the Farm Burger and I forgot which hamburger my bf got, but everything was delicious!  The truffle fries were crisp and absolutely heavenly.  My burger was piled high, and the fried egg just made it that more delicious!  I made sure to save room for the pudding shake, which we shared.  We had the chocolate hazelnut coffee shake and I was surprised how good it was. Not overly rich or sweet.  A must try!!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay in LV? Wow, I never thought it could happen.  A lot of people complain about the line or the wait time to be seated, but my family member owns a seven star card that allows us to skip right ahead to the line, so I really can't complain about the wait time.  The food is good. I ordered the farm burger with butter lettuce and the onion rings. They were spectacular and the food definitely is top notch for a burger restaurant. The  wait time for the food however is a totally different story, it took a good 40 minutes or so for the food to come out, I mean come on now really?  So to recap, the price is moderate and the food is good. The wait time? Not so much, but I'd consider it to be worth it. Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Thanks to YELP, we decided to try this place.  First off, it isn't easy to get in...always a line and people with \"Diamond Status\" at Planet Hollywood skip the line, so even though we were only the second group in line, it took 20 minutes.    About the food, the truffle Parmesan fries are awesome, but the beer batter Maui onion rings were out of the world!  The burger was great as well, ate the whole half pound, but left a bunch of fries and rings that we split.  Split a burger and get the rings, you will thank me.  The only drawback is that the burger is not cheap at $14-$15 a la carte."}
{"text":"Wow!! Awesome food. The euro burger and truffle fries are off the hook!!! Don't wait in line if the back bar is open. It is so worth sitting at the bar and watching the cooks"}
{"text":"This is hands down the most awful burger I have ever eaten. I came here because of the reviews and 2 burgers and soft drinks will run you $50 bucks. I don't care so much about the price but how does a guy who yells at people in kitchens for a living for making crappy food allow this debacle to be served. Just go to In and Out, Bobbys Burger Palace or Red Robin if you want a good burger. It's just a thick patty made of salt with some beef in it. It's pretty hard to screw up a burger and this man has mastered the art of it."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night. They quoted a 45 minute wait but it ended up only being about 25. The burgers were spot on! We both enjoyed our meal & would definitely recommend it to other burger enthusiasts. My burger had mozzarella, avocado & bacon. The fries were great too! It was convenient also since we were staying at Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Right there at the top with best burgers I've ever had! Very reasonable prices for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, even if it's burgers.  We had the Hell's Kitchen Burger - perfectly prepared medium rare, with oven roasted tomatoes, asadero cheese, and roasted jalapenos. All the flavors worked well and the texture of the bun was great! I had this complimented with a glass of Boddingtons (of course, being at a GR place)  The American Burger was a classic taste. Again, the texture of the bun was perfect, which made the burger so much better. We also had the Truffle Parmesan Fries with truffle aioli which made it a great side combination.  We ended the meal by sharing the Shake #1 - caramel pudding + chocolate shake + toffee cookie. It was amazing and delicious! We were already pretty full from the burgers and fries though, that we couldn't finish the entire shake.  What a fun place and great for families! There was a bit of a wait, but they texted us when our table was almost ready, giving us a chance to roam around the casino floor. They have a good selection of BurGR souvenirs, from shirts, to hats, and shot glasses. We decided to purchase of couple of their beer glasses, a great reminder of a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not a big Burger fan but when we came across Gordon Ramsay's Burger restaurant it was a no brainier the service was excellent and the food was even better The Hell's kitchen Burger was to die for and the fries were overloaded with cheesy perfection . we will defiantly be returning here next time we visit Vegas"}
{"text":"I just so happened to by pass this place and there was a line of about 15 people. Since I was hungry, I decided to see what's the line for. It turned out to be only a 15 minute wait. The staff was friendly And cool. My server was knowledgable and it seems liked she enjoyed her job and the place.... I had the truffle burger and it was outstanding!!! But I also had an order of onion rings.... And I must say they are some of the best onion rings I've ever had!! .... The menu was a little limited but the food was outstanding!!! If you love burgers and don't want to spend a lot of money on food, this is the place for you. I will definitely  be back..."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey offers delicious burgers with a gourmet feel. I love to keep things simple, especially with cheeseburgers but if you add a twist and know what you're doing it can be a nice surprise.   I went a little simple this time and ordered a medium well burger with mushrooms. It was very tasty, the beef was hearty and the mushrooms were grilled and delicious. I also ordered the sweet potato fries and I think this was my favorite thing lol. It was the sauce that got me. I want to say it was a mustardy sweet kind of sauce, it was very good. The fries also come with powdered sugar on top so you have your sweet and savory party in your mouth.   I also tried the parmesan truffle fries which were amazing! The bold flavors really kick you in the throat but leave you wanting more. The truffle was not overpowering either so don't be afraid. They serve them with their house ketchup. Most places make their house ketchup with more of a marinara flavor, but not Gordon! This was sweet but flavorful and robust at the same time. If you want a decent burger and don't mind paying a little more, please visit! I'll be back to try some of their milk shakes and other  desserts"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant and it was not a great experience. The food is good but not worth the price and it's very unorganized. They kept forgetting food items, didn't cook some of the burgers correctly, and there was no communication between staff. Our waitress and the manager were nice at least, but it seemed like the kitchen was out of control. They said they wanted us to leave happy but did little to accommodate for their mistakes."}
{"text":"Are here for lunch yesterday with my wife. I'm a fan of chef Ramsay and was really excited to eat here. Got the farmers burger and it was fantastic. My wife got the chicken burger and she really enjoyed it. We split an order of fries. Portions were generous. Neither of us finished our meals. A bit pricey but it is Vegas. Service was a little slow or I would have given a 5."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, delicious truffle fries, and good beer on tap selections!  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and while not the biggest burger I've ever had but one of the largest in terms of flavor.  It was also perfectly located right by the Brittney show so perfect place to grab something to eat before the show."}
{"text":"Ok, truth be told, I don't like Gordon Ramsay, never watch him on TV and I'm not a big burger fan because I don't eat beef.  So why did I find myself at his restaurant?  Because my husband is a true meat guy and wanted to give it a try and since I'd looked at the menu I knew they had stuff that I'd eat.  First let me say if you're hungry, get there early.  We hadn't had lunch so opted to eat around 6 instead of waiting and were glad that we did. Service is a bit slow, I mean how long does it take to cook a burger, so when we got out it was after 7:00 and there was a line half way down the corridor.    Lots of different burgers for the meat eater but my husband opted to just have a good old fashioned hamburger with lettuce, tomato and pickles.  I had a portabello mushroom burger, yum.  Both were served on really great buns which I'm guessing are home made in house.  Be aware that if you want fries or a side, it's separate.  However, the sides are quite large and big enough to share.    Both sandwiches were absolutely yummy and huge which made eating a challenge.  We got onion rings instead of fries for a change and they came dusted with cheese.  Except that they were a tad greasy, best onion rings I've had in ages.  Great crust that didn't fall off when you picked them up and amazing flavor.  So if you want a burger on the strip, check this place out.  They don't take reservations so plan accordingly and try to eat in the off times."}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat at Gordon Ramsay BurGR, and his name did not disappoint! Amazing, delicious, juicy and innovative shakes, appetizers and desserts. The star of the show are the amazing burgers!  Chanterelle mushroom burger - so delicious and exceeded my expectations! The meat was tender and juicy, and was topped with perfectly cooked chanterelle mushrooms and arugula. The bun was soft and melt in my mouth, just the way I like it.   Honey-pig bao buns - I loved the juicy pork belly and the crunchy cucumber, radish and cilantro. The honey-hoisin sauce was sweet and went perfectly to complete the experience of this amazing appetizer.  Truffle-Parmesan Fries - Delicious truffle and cheesy goodness on each fry. Served with a luscious truffle aioli. Huge portion, one order can definitely be split by two people.   The restaurant is located at a prime location in Planet Hollywood. The flames at the exterior of the entrance is phenomenal and hard to miss. The decor is awesome and futuristic with the cool lights and fun interactive menu at the entrance.  Service is friendly and prompt. We arrived right before the restaurant opened and fortunately were seated right away.   Make sure to get their early if you want to be seated soon. There are no reservations, and often a wait at this popular burger joint.    Overall I really enjoyed Gordon Ramsay BurGR! Food is delicious and the experience is fun. Definitely worth stopping in here for amazing burger goodness while in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had hell's kitchen burger and it was perfectly cooked and full of flavors. Service was also nice that my glass was continuously refilled. I had really good dinner time. I strongly recommand you to visit here."}
{"text":"45 minute wait.  Worth it? Absolutely not.  The food took long to come out.  I started off with the pork belly bun.  The pork belly had nice flavor to it, thus the 2 star.  Otherwise it would have been a 1 star.  Pork belly was good, but the ratio of meat to veggie and bun was absurd.  Tried the farm burger along with all 3 different fries.  I thought the patty was a little flavorless and the overall taste did not meet my expectations of going to a world renown chef.  Looks like that place needs hells kitchen!"}
{"text":"My burger was simply delicious. Perfectly cooked and the quality was great too, especially for the price. The truffle fries were great but portions are pretty generous so order 1 per like 4 people and it should be enough."}
{"text":"The best burger that I have eaten!!  And, the shakes were also sooooo nice. That pudding... I never forget!  Really hope that this burger house open in NYC!!!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible hamburgers.  Highly recommend the Hell's Kitchen Burgr   Great atmosphere, service was very good and prices were not bad at all considering your in Planet Hollywood , Las Vegas. We waited over hour so be prepared for that when you come"}
{"text":"Ahhhhhh ok BurGR you are pretty damn tasty!  The place can get pretty packed I think, but judging by the quickness of the service and stuff, it seems like the wait doesn't get too bad. But what do I know, my bf('s dad) is some kind of diamond premium 7 star 10 million points bla dee bla member so we didn't have to wait in line. HELL YA!  Anyway so as usual, the bf and I ordered too much food but whatever...... lol. Got some onion rings, side of fries (truffle I think?) and we each ordered a burger. We each also ordered a shake lol...  I got the special burger of the day, so I don't even know what it's called lol. Totes forgots. But it was a pork patty, cheese, lettuce, the usje. Also had avocado, duck bacon, and some spicy-ish relish. Pretty damn tasty actually! Patty was cooked perfectly. But now that I know what a pork burger tastes like, I think I still prefer a beef patty. Good ol beef!  Speaking of beef, the bf got the farm burger, which is a beef patty with... I think a runny egg, cheese, and some duck bacon.. among other things. Honestly his burger was better lol. I just remember enjoying his a tad bit more.  Fries were goooooooooooood. Nice and CRISPY outside, soft inside... whew got all hot and bothered for a sec. So deliciously cheesy with some truffle aioli and what I believe was curry ketchup? Perfect fries paired with some perfect sauces. Same with the onion rings. SO nice and crispy with some real good dips!  And then there's the shake....... I got the banana/butterscotch and bf got the strawberry/coconut. It's a little different than your usual milk shake. Mine was basically a banana milkshake topped with a butterscotch pudding. Not sure if you were supposed to mix it together lol but I did! I think it made the texture better/smoother and the flavors more in yo face. No need for dessert if you got yourself a shake lol.  Overall, some of the better burgers/food I've had! Definitely pricey lol but it's Gordon Ramsay. That guy knows."}
{"text":"I don't get all of the 4 star reviews. The burgers were okay, I've had better in my hometown. Burgers are \"fancy\" and pricey because of the name attached to the restaurant. Only good thing is that it was close and walkable from our hotel (Elara which is connected to PH). The staff however was friendly and patient with our semi large table."}
{"text":"This was our third visit here, the server was lazy but the food was good.  Enjoyed seeing chef Cristina/ our table mate felt the farm burger could use more salt.  I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was supposed to be spicy but wasn't.  I will try it again.  The sweet potato fries with powered sugar we're my fav."}
{"text":"Honestly wasn't blown away by the burger but the service was amazing. Taylor was our server and gave us the best service we experienced all weekend. The gooey fries were amazing...and we happened to get luck enough to be there on an afternoon that Vin Diesel was guest bartending. Quite a coup!"}
{"text":"you have to try the place just because it is gordon Ramsey.  Great burger"}
{"text":"Still the best Burger I have ever had. OMG Gooey Fries....LOL the best."}
{"text":"Pretty solid 4.5-5 star rating.   A friend of mine wanted to try Gordon Ramsey's Restaurant for lunch today so here we are... For groups of 3 or more, you must check in with the hostess who then adds your name to the wait list. We were to receive a text when your table was almost ready. While waiting for our table, we went next door to the bar to kill time. Another 15 minutes or so passed and then we receive a text!  We found think to be really quick because we overheard other patrons saying they had to wait for almost an hour..   We were seated in one of the comfy, booth tables located in the main dining area facing the decent size TVs, airing sports games. Our server Matt, who is one of the GM trainers was our server today. Matt is all-around one of the best servers we've ever had who waited on us! He is extremely polite and carries himself well, plus he displays just they right amount of attentiveness.   Let's discuss food.. As you know with its name they offer different types of burgers here. The Hog burger was the talk of the town at our table. Man, I don't even like pork but this burger is absolutely phenomenal, it offers a pork patty with pulled pork resulting in so much rich flavors! Second to that the Hell'a Kitchen Burger was the next favorite. This burger offers a beef (juicy) patty with jalapeño aioli, white cheese and sautéed jalapeños within. The spicy flavors can be found throughout this burger, my fav! The least favorite, which was good not great is the Truffle Burger; with is beef patty this burger also includes arugula, and the other main fixtures. First couple bites are good but then the arugula becomes very empowering.   We also ordered the 3 types of French fries options:  1. Gooey Fries: whoa, simply mind blowing! Imagine cheesy fries with slices of salami, more cheese and an over easy egg drizzled on top! Rich, filling, but super tasty!   2. Sweet Potato Fries: I ordered these to try the jalapeño-honey dipping sauce, yum yum!   3. Truffle Fries: all around table favorite! Good crunch with every note and perfectly seasoned. These fries are the wider-wedge cut. Good stuff right here!   For dessert, my friend ordered Shake #4, mainly made with Oreo. First and for most, these shakes are huge so I would recommend you share with another person.  Thank you so much BurGR for the wonderful experience, we are excited to tell all of our friends about your wonderful establishment.  ...Hopefully we can meet the big guy himself, Mr. Gordon Ramsey, they say he randomly comes I every month and half, and he is due for a store visit soon..."}
{"text":"Til this day my husband and I will randomly bring up how amazing the chicken wings were. I still get random cravings for the fish sandwich. This place is a must go to when in Vegas.   Oh and the jalapeño poppers---- ammaaaazing. They come in these tubes.  Trust me, it's not just the hype."}
{"text":"We went to Las Vegas to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday. Being fans of Chef Ramsay's shows, my 21 year old wanted to dine at one of Chef Ramsay's dining establishments. Not a let down from the moment we were greeted by a very welcoming and friendly staff/manager, but all throughout the meal, we were delighted by all the food! The burgers/fries were the best we have ever tasted! On leaving, I went up to the manager and thanked her for a wonderful evening, celebrating my oldest daughter's big day. I said the only thing that would make this better, would be to have her meet Chef Ramsay. It turned out, that the famous Chef was actually showing up for this restaurant's anniversary and the topper of a fantastic evening, was the picture Chef Ramsay took with my daughter! Thank you so very much Chef Ramsay for an unforgettable memory!! Would love to visit your Hell's Kitchen some day!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. The service was also very good and the waiter was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"The burger was great! I got one with duck topping and it really popped! Stick with the sweet potato fries over any other type though."}
{"text":"Went back for the 2nd time in Vegas last week and am already looking forward to my next visit. The place screams contemporary Vegas. Giant flame display at the front of the place, Gordon's crazy face on the menu, the neon red bar, waitresses in tight spandex. It almost feels like a theme park of a restaurant. But the food delivers. The wings with blue cheese are amazing. The farm burger is great and truffle fries with fresh made dipping sauces, ah yes! Very friendly and speedy wait staff to boot.  Little pricey but what isn't in Vegas?!  Go GORDON OR GO HOME!"}
{"text":"There's always a line at this place. Friends and family who have tried it recommended me to try BurGR. I split half of my Farm burger so I can have room to try out the appetizers. I never had or heard of duck breast bacon before, so I gave the Farm Burger a try as their recommended picks. You can also choose on how you like your patty cooked, which I had mine at medium rare. We had the highly rated truffle fries and jalapeno poppers for appetizers. The truffle fries wasn't for us. It came with 2 dipping sauces and the fries were a bit salty with a dust of parmesan cheese on top, which wasn't to my liking as many Yelpers have mentioned their truffle fries as a must. The jalapeno poppers were pretty good, hot, and crispy. Each pieces came in their own little shot glass dipped with its sauce. The size of the burgers is average, not too small and not too big. If you're hungry enough, you can be full after a burger and maybe a shared appetizer. The burgers were really good and flavorful. It's a bit pricey for a hamburger for about $15, but it was good! My nephew had the Hell's Kitchen Burger which had the hint of spice and enjoyed his. I also had the Shake #4 was my dessert and it was one of the best shakes I have had. I had my nephews sampling it and they also liked it. My friend normally hates milkshakes told me that it's actually the best milkshake she has ever had and told me to try it when I visit BurGR. I'm glad I listened to her because I agree! Prices weren't too bad, a bit higher than a typical burger place, but you're paying for quality under Gordon Ramsay's name. We recommended my sister to try it out with her husband and they did and they liked it. The waiting time varies, but it's that good coming from a stranger replying back to me when I said \"OMG it's an HOUR wait!\"  Tip: You can save $1 off of each menu item if you're a Total Rewards member!"}
{"text":"Quick review I expected the wait for seating, but not the long wait for the food (it's only burgers). After the wait, still got my temp wrong  on my burger (more waiting) Taste was good but portion were small for the high price on Maui onion rings, fries and burgers. Service was real good.  I believe KGB (Kerry Gourmet burger) and Burger bar are much better burger places. Still a fan of Chef Ramsey."}
{"text":"Amazing taste. Ordered the chef's special and it was delicious. Great customer service and a nice atmosphere. Second time there and it was as great as the first time :)"}
{"text":"The burgers were in fact absolutely amazing as was the fish and chips!! I had a banana pudding and oreo shake which was also very good.  The only issue I had with this place was the waitress outfits, the placemats oddly enough, and the chair height. Sounds nitpicky I know, but this is why I couldn't give it a 5 star.   The waitress outfits were a short skirt onesy that is stitched is a way that is awkwardly unflattering. This sounds really rude but I kept glancing at the mid sections.  The placemats were a really thick leather that I kept felt like I was sticking to and couldn't maneuver the items on the small table around. I just put the on the side of the bench seat and fixed that issue.  Lastly the chairs are really low to the ground. As I looked around everyone was eating and upper chest level and my knees popped when I got up after dinner.  That all said the food is absolutely outstanding!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 8 people and the wait was about 20-30 minutes. I ordered the Farm Burger[duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, fried egg] and it was one of the best burger's i've ever had. Fried egg on burgers is underrated. As for the much talked about Truffle Parmesan Fries it was a huge miss with me. Everything was really salty and I couldn't even finish them."}
{"text":"There seems to be a long wait and the prices are on the high side, but they had the best burgers I've ever had. The onion rings and sweet potato fries were also amazing as well as an attentive staff made this one of the best times I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"With over 2000 reviews and a 4-star rating, my review will do little to impact the average. I'll still put in my two cents:  After finishing the meal, my thought was that those giving Burgr 4* don't get around much. Maybe they live in a city with lousy food and this really mediocre burger is \"the best ever\".  My first reaction to the menu was that I may come back. There are a lot of fun items on it in addition to the burgers. I ended up ordering the Farm Burger and the Aioli / Parmesan fries. This was on the strong recommendation of the server (and many reviews here). In the end: Ho-Hum cheese, ho-hum duck bacon, a fried egg that was over done ( the yolk should be runny and become like a sauce to the burger; it was fully cooked). Worse yet, my Medium-Rare burger came medium-well. I wanted to yell out \"You Donkey! You overcooked the #@$%@ Burger\". I dealt with it as unless something egregiously bad I don't like to send it back as I know it goes straight to the bin. The parmesan fries are large rectangular cut. The aioli was good, but that's hard to mess up. The fries were a bit chewy. Not crisp outside, soft inside as they should be. I get way better fries from fry trucks at home.  I don't get the four stars. Even if the meat was done right, it would not have been great."}
{"text":"It is a must to visit this place. We have been in a line for 45 minutes , but the food and the great service took all of that tiredness. Such a pleasant experience. The original sweat potato has a very tasty sauce on the side. If you are a fan order that. I really enjoyed my time. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"A must go eatery if you are fan of Hell Kitchen.  Their burger is delicious and oh the Truffle Fries is a must try!!!   The Hell's burger is great for those into the spicy delicatessen! nom nom nom... I will go back there if I go to vegas again!"}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be good but maybe a little disappointing because like a lot of people I've watched Gordon Ramsey on tv and feared it wouldn't live up to my expectations.  I was pleasantly surprised. I got the Uber Cheese Burger at the recommendation of our server. I LOVED it. The burger, the bun, the cheese...all perfect. My friend had the Hell's Kitchen burger. He really enjoyed it as well. He mentioned thinking the burgers were on the smaller side. I thought they were decent sized. He said it was such a good burger, he didn't mind that it wasn't monstrous.  Truffle fries...also at the recommendation of our server. FINALLY a truffle item that lived up to the truffle hype. We both loved those as well. There was one fry in the middle that was insanely salty but they were so good, I dealt with it. Loved the house ketchup and was told the aioli was delicious.  I thought prices were very reasonable. Especially considering it's las Vegas and there is the Gordon Ramsay factor at play. I also thought it was a nice touch that after seeing us pose for photos like total nerds with the menu, the waiter asked if we'd like to take home a free collectors menu. Probably avoids people stealing them and made my friends night.  We had sticky toffee pudding push ups for dessert. They were good but I was so full I couldn't even finish it.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As an avid Gordon Ramsay fan & after going to Gordon Ramsay Steak (located at Paris hotel & Casino) the year prior - I knew I was stopping in the visit BurGR.  No I didn't spell that wrong - that's what it's called. The last GR is Gordon Ramsay's initials.   As soon as you approach this place you see the large wall of fire from the casino floor.  I knew we had a winner here!   When walking in , you can already tell that from GR Steak- it's a more casual feel/atmosphere.   As soon as you sit- you already see that GR has paid attention to detail. The menu/ place setting is set up in a unique way.   The Service is typical GR service, Phenomenal Service!! The prices for the Vegas Strip are pretty darn good!!  There is a wide selection of how the burgers are topped off with - but the Burger itself is thick, juicy, and cooked to perfection. DELISH !!!  The burgers don't come with fries but that's ok because side order is good enough to split. Parmesan Truffle Fries might I add! BOOM!   I knew that since this is a Gordon Ramsay place That dining here wouldn't be an upset. Didn't realize it was that good!"}
{"text":"Sexy waitress...definitely eye candy for the all the Man out there. Burger was great too..will definitely be back here when I am back in Vegas next time."}
{"text":"I came here because I am a big gordon fan plus I saw this place features on buzzfeed. They made the burgers look amazing so I decided to give it a try.  I got The Hog burger and it was pretty good. Certainly above average. The pulled pork and really gave the burger a lot of flavor. Is it worth the money? Probably not. This place is more expensive than it should be because of Gordon's name. I would not say it's a must visit. You will probably find better \"value for money\" burgers around Vegas.  Service was great though. Burgers take a while to get out but that's understandable. Maybe around 20 minutes. As Gordon says \"customers will wait for good food\"."}
{"text":"Gordon does not disappoint at this delicious burger place. We ended up having lunch here twice on our trip because we were so pleased with our first visit. Both times we ordered the onion rings. My husband and I agreed that these were the best onion rings we'd ever had. They came with a cheddar ranch sauce for dipping which was out of this world. The burgers were really tasty also, and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the hot dog too, but honestly probably would have preferred a other burger! We also sampled the jalapeño poppers which my husband adored (I'm not big on spicy in general). You could tell that everything was fresh and homemade. Also, the service was awesome on both visits. Each table has a server and an assistant so there's always someone available if you need something. I will definitely return here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it zero stars.  Went with a party of 8, me and one of the other person showed up a little later since we had to walk from the MGM. By the time we got there the rest had already ordered there meals.  I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the sweet potato fries. Everyone's meal came out, and I waited a few minutes then I asked the waiter what was the status of my fries. He said he never put my order in because the last person was still reading the menu because he was getting a full meal. I asked he could just put my order in since I only wanted fries, he got upset and told me to wait and relax the fries only gonna take 30 seconds to make and stomped off. Everyone at the table asked me what was going and I explained and by this time they were almost done with their food. He came back with some plates and puts them in the middle of the table, I asked why the plates everyone already had there food? He said for me to share the fries I told him I had no intentions of sharing my fries, again he got upset and told me to take the plates and slam them on the floor. By this time I was fuming so I decided to get up and leave before this situation escalate any further and I wasn't paying my hard earned money for bad service."}
{"text":"Definitely an over-rated spot. The wait was an hour on a Saturday night.  Good thing we came early.  It took forever to get seated after the hour mark.  The service was really good in general.     I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and added a fried egg to it because I love fried eggs on my burger.  Was the burger good?  Yes, but not worth an hour wait or the average sticker price of $15 a burger.  For that price I actually prefer Red Robin (I know, how blasphemous but so true).  And that even comes with bottomless fries and the burgers are juicier.  The fries here were pretty good but not worth the high price tag.  I did try someone's Oreo shake and it was REALLY good.  That's probably worth ordering for sure.    I'm glad I tried this once but I probably won't come back again, nor recommend this place.  Not worth the wait or the price."}
{"text":"Delicious and my new favorite for a burger when in Vegas. The line for waiting is a bit obnoxious (would prefer a reservation system) since the heat from the sign is actually pretty warm. Food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Admittedly, I was neither super excited nor super hungry when this suggestion was brought up by a friend. Sometimes I feel that people go to a place just for the name. As a result, a 'name' can make a place somewhat mediocre while still drawing in the people. The first sign of its popularity was the 90 minute wait.  Luckily for us, we had made arrangements limiting our wait to five minutes. Although I wasn't hungry, I couldn't bring myself to order a salad at a burger joint, especially one that demands such a long wait. Not knowing if or when I might come back, I just went for a burger and figured I'd just eat as much as I could.   I went with the Hell's Kitchen Burger, as I don't mind some heat but it also seemed like their unofficial signature burger. I mean, I could just get an American burger anywhere. One of the ways I judge a burger is whether they can nail the way it's prepared. So many places can't get medium rare to save their lives. Of course, quality of meat and seasoning are the other factors.   This place nailed it all and what happened next was me devouring the entire burger. It was really good, perhaps worth the wait, and probably worth the name. Ramsey got this one right and people know it! I'm a believer."}
{"text":"\"Meh.\" That was my overall impression of the food.   Living in Southern California has given me a lot of opportunities to eat gourmet and fast food burgers. I went in expecting Gordon Ramsay's burgers to blow my mind, but I was disappointed. The burgers weren't anything special and I don't see myself craving another one. The burgers we got were about $13-14, which is typical from my experience. Hell's Kitchen Burger was spicier than I thought it would be! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone that can't handle moderately spicy food.   If you want fries, you'll have to order them on the side. The \"Just Fries\" are plain \"fat/thick\" fries that'll run you about $7-8. It comes with a spicy curry dip and and house made ketchup. In the house made ketchup you can really taste the brown sugar (yum). Again, the fries were \"meh.\"  However, the presentation and atmosphere of this restaurant made the dining experience was fabulous."}
{"text":"The service and food here is amazing! We waited for about 45 minutes in a line to get in but it was well worth it.  They apologized for our wait time but it was understandable because its 4th of July weekend.  We ordered jalapeño poppers, the Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle fries and beers. All of the food was what you would expect from a restaurant that has Gordon Ramsey's name on it...delicious! Prices weren't too bad. The total came out to about $65.00. The service was incredible. The manager and waitress took the time to chat with us and make us feel welcome. On top of that, considering how busy it was, no one seemed frazzled or stressed out. Definitely would recommend coming here If you're in town."}
{"text":"Gordon, practice what you preach on TV!  Came here with my boyfriend to celebrate my audition for Nevada Ballet Theater. I was quite hesitant to begin with because of the prices, but being that it was GR I thought, sure, why not?  Now I'm not saying the food was bad, because it wasn't. But, I'm also not saying that the food was amazing, because it also wasn't. I ordered a delux burger, but was given a bluecheese burger- WRONG WRONG WRONG! My partner got a Royal burger, which was good but wasn't amazing. We've definitely had muuuch better. We got an order of truffle Parmesan fries, expensive, but they were amazingly delicious.  All in all, this was the most expensive burger experience we've had yet, and maybe not most worth it. But, definitely give it a try! $50 meal for 2. Our waitress was phenomenal, but it did take us quite a while to get our food."}
{"text":"Nice looking place!  Greeted with a flaming wall with the BURGR logo.  Name is catchy I must say!  Ordered a Farm Burger which has duck bacon, sharp cheddar, and an egg.  Just fries for a side.  I wish I would've ordered my burger medium well.  Accidentally said medium and well, I realized I like my meat cooked more.  Bacon was delicious!  Could definitely tell it was duck.  Over easy egg all in a multi seeded bun.  Simple combo.  I do wish the meat was seasoned better but overall pretty good burger.  Not a fan is steak fries!  Wish they were a different cut.  They came out piping hot with some interesting ketchups.  I would say, I prefer the regular Heinz ketchup :) for fries.  Sauce wasn't bad, just didn't seem to pair right with the fries.  Overall nice ambience is fun and not so bad burger!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was decent. I had the farm burger which was good but I didn't think it was worth the price. They have really good Parmesan truffle fries and dipping sauces but the service was horrible. It took forever to get our food and our waitress rarely came over."}
{"text":"I love Gordon Ramsey on TV and never had any of his food. Since he has like 5 places in Vegas, we decided to check out one of less expensive ones.  I ordered the meatless mushroom burger, my mom had a classic cheeseburger.  They don't serve their burgers with ketchup and let me tell you, the cheeseburger does not need any condiments. The burger was cooked perfectly, the lettuce was crisp, the tomato wasn't soggy, the bun was grilled and buttered nicely. You could taste the quality meat and the fat that they cook with and that flavor was fantastic.  I loved my mushroom burger... I thought there was too much bread though because it doesn't have the same height as a meat burger. We didn't get any fries or sides and we didn't need any.  I would love to try another burger there, something I wouldn't normally try.  The wait is long... It's vegas... I don't give them a knock for that but the food takes a long time to get.  Great Job Chef Ramsey."}
{"text":"I love BurGR. I make it a point to always eat here every time I'm in Vegas.   So why 4 stars and not 5? Well this is solely based on my last dining experience.  First off, the wait to get a table was a little ridiculous. 2 hrs for a table? Umm, no thanks. Luckily my dad has the highest status as a total rewards member (rewards program offered at Planet Hollywood) so we didn't have to wait quite as long.   If you haven't yet, I would highly recommend checking this place out. I would just try coming during off times to avoid the long wait."}

{"text":"I've been looking forward to eating here since watching Christina win HK! Finally had time this trip to Vegas. The short of it is, we left.   The long story is that while over-priced (my beer cost the same as a 6-pack of the same beer at home) the beer was solid. The onion rings were really salty, but we blamed it on the parmesan.  The sauces were amazing.   Then came the burgers.  We ordered them medium and medium-well. They were both on the rare side of medium-rare. That would have been ok. We would have still eaten them, but our fingers literally dripped grease with the first bite.  The bottom bun was completely saturated.   Hungry, we paid more than $30 to leave, and had dinner at a sports bar at MGM."}
{"text":"I just wanted to add a review on a different burger I tried here called the Britannia. It definitely trumped over the other burgers I had the last time I came here. OMgosh that mango chutney yo! I didn't know what mango chutney was at first, but it appeared to be a spread/condiment with a spice and mango blend. It's the perfect topping to compliment the the flavors in this burger. If you like sweet and savory, then I highly recommend this burger.  Similar to my last visit here, the fries were soggy. This time it was also a little burnt. The portion was pretty big though for $8 worth. I shared a side of fries with 2 other people and there was still half left over at the end. I will probably try a different side here the next time I come back since soggy fries 2x in a row ain't going to cut it."}
{"text":"Hands down, best burger you'll ever eat! This place is a must try, you won't be sorry!!"}
{"text":"This place serves legit burgers that is for sure.  We ordered few burgers to split between 5 of us and it was plenty.   Food is pricey and the line & wait can be long but if you are a foodie just try it.  Docking off one star due to slow service"}
{"text":"Down to the facts:  Located inside Planet Hollywood on the strip. I love Gordon Ramsay I'm a huge fan(Biggest crush ever) and It met the standards of his quality. Not to mention the gorgeous menu of his big head, and amazing hair.  When you walk in they have a huge flame wall with a fire contained inside its pretty awesome.   I got the Uber Cheese Burger which had fontina cheese, raclette cheese and goat cheese. Im a huge fan of mushrooms so I added a mushroom. I cooked it medium it was really tender and juicy the mushroom was like this huge portobella right under the bun it added an extra component of crunch just amazing. I also had to get one of the milkshakes and went with the shake #4 crème brûlée pudding + oreo cookie shake.   They bring your shake out and the shake has this like top coating of pudding that lies right on top of the shake. I wasn't a huge fan of Creme Brulee pudding but the oreo shake part was amazing. I definitely recommend getting one with your burger.   Despite the restaurant always having a line here are some things to know:  1. Get in line and give your name to the lady with the IPAD ASAP so they can seat you as soon as they can.   2. If you were walking the strip a lot all day, give your phone to them they'll charge it if its dead.  3. They don't rush you at all, and you can take as much time as you need to order.  4. IF YOU ORDER A PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM ON TOP OF YOUR BEEF BURGER THEY CHARGE CLOSE TO 8 DOLLARS AS IF YOU ORDER A SECOND BEEF PATTY.  Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Good service, great presentation of meals and taste burgrs thanks for having lagunitas on tap. Just need fresher avacado but it is understandable with how much is on the shells kitchen burger. My wife loves burgers and loved hers. Also the jalapenos where really spicy and good. Recommended everything here and the jalapenos poppers amazingly good."}
{"text":"Really liked it! There is a unique twist on each burger. We were a party of four and each one received burgers cooked to perfection. The plating is tasteful and suits the ambiance."}
{"text":"First things first.... the chairs. Everyone that sat down commented on how terrible the chairs are. They are so low to the ground that your knees are above your hips, and your back hunches because the only place to put your feet is to spread them out across the table. Also, when I ordered a milkshake it was so tall, that when sitting straight in the chair I could barely get my mouth to the top to take a sip. Really... its just plain ridiculousness. The burger I had wasn't all that to write home about (Hells Kitchen Burger), but the Gordon Burger was on point. It was a pork hamburger with duck bacon, and it was bursting with flavors! I wish I would have ordered that in hindsight, but I did really enjoy my milkshake."}
{"text":"Lines can get long but if you go to the hostess booth they can get you in faster. Food can take a bit but well worth the wait. Ordered the duck burger with duck bacon. Very tasty. The Gooey Fries were AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"We stayed at Planet Hollywood and found ourselves at BurGR on our first night. About 20 minute wait as they had told us. We had a great server that made perfect recommendations for our first time. I have the farm burger and my wife had the Euro burger and we split an order of onion rings.  Quite frankly the best burger I have ever had.  We went back 2 nights later and again it was great!! Not sure if I will eat a burger  here at home because I will be thinking of BurGR!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, GReat burger!  What a great place to come for lunch. There was no wait and we were seated immediately. Our waiter was very pleasant and took our orders quickly.  I had the American burger which was pretty standard (cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle) but cooked to order and delicious. I requested extra pickles and received an entire bowl of them. I also had the strawberry shake with coconut pudding...amazing! Beware the portions of the fries are huge and easily shareable with 1 to 3 people.  Another hit for Chef Ramsey! I'll be back."}
{"text":"So babe had to stay almost an hour in the line to get us a table in GordonRamsay 's BURGR last night which was not a problem, we had high expectations and were uber exicited to eat there! we ordered signature Hell's Kitchen burger, Brittania burger and one portion of sugar powdered sweet potato fries, plus asian buns with honey pork as starter. And Unfortunately it was such a disappointment! Everything tasted sooo greasy( buns were soaked with fat that even hubby couldn't eat it (he is not a picky eater at all), fries extremely greasy and the sauce was off , in asian buns pork were so chewy and blend I had to take a burger out of the buns to be able to eat at least smth  ( meat tasted good though) but common what about the rest? Major dissapointment! and don't even let me start about the service(((( I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan so for me it was such a bummer I hounestly felt like I'm being punkd and they are filming another Kitchen Nightmares episode"}
{"text":"We went here a few years ago and let me just say it was so amazing. The burgers were perfect and he has such a great list of beers"}
{"text":"this place is everything that i thought it would be and more!! the service was amazing and the Burger surpassed any and all expectations!! my Husband and i split the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  yes! Yes!! YES!!!!! soooooo goood! in addition to the beer and service ... it MUST be said that i wish this place was in a Chicago!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is busy!!!! I went at 11:30 pm thinking it shouldn't be packed but it was. Had to wait a little for a table.   I got the truffle burger for $21. The burger meat itself was grilled perfectly, but I did not taste any truffle or foie gras in my burger at all. I wouldn't order it again. I also ordered truffle fries. It was good until I got to the end when it got too salty and oily. Their beer selection wasn't good.   Overall it was good but not great. The place is a bit pricey for burgers. Burger is huge so you can split one, and when you do they cut it in half for you so it is easier to share. I wouldn't go back. Just a place you should just try once just to say you've been there."}
{"text":"Was shocked here... Just not impressed.  There was 5 of us grabbing a quick bite.  When the table next to you is less than 3 inches away and the persons sitting next to you are so close they may as well be at your table... It's to close.  The food.  We all ordered different burgers, couple orders of the fries and some jalapeno poppers and shakes.  2 of the burgers were overcooked and dry (well done, not the med rare we ordered).  Would have sent them back but we couldn't get the attention of any server for so long we just wanted to get outta there!  The staff was so scattered getting service near impossible.    My burger while cooked perfectly and juicy (upper side of med rare) was well.. BLAND!  The whole thing was just lacking on seasoning.  Just really underwhelming for a burger.  Seriously, bland.. The bun litterally had more flavor than the burger on it.  The shakes came much later than the food.. WTH?  Its not desert.. it part of my meal.. But coming 15 mins after the burger is just... well... sad... Again, couldn't get the attention of ANY server.. all to busy I guess...  The Jalapeno poppers sadly were the star of our meal and by the time we got them they were so cooled down that the cheese in the middle was setting up already.  So here it was.. well... just not up to snuff... the service was slow and timing was off, people were jammed in like sardines, under seasoned burgers and 2 very over cooked ones...  Everyone at the table was like \"ehhh\" nothing special and not sure if we would even want to return.    I wouldn't go back.  Better burgers in many places in Vegas.  Disappointed this is a Ramsay restaurant..."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp I knew I had to try this place for myself. My friends and I ordered the following:  1. Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings [$9] 2. Roasted Jalapeño Poppers [$12] 3. \"Just Fries\" [$8] 4. Chanterelle Burger [$16] 5. Hell's Kitchen Burger [$14] 6. Farm Burger [$15]  If I had to choose one item from the list above I would choose the Roasted Jalapeño  Poppers!   The food and service was great but if you go during a busy time you'll most likely end up waiting 30+ minutes before getting seated."}
{"text":"Good food long ass wait we literally waited like two hours to be seated and an extra hour just to receive our food food was okay"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie: I have a man crush on Gordon Ramsay. Don't get me wrong, he's not Sam Jackson or the Rock, but he's definitely on the list. So when I was in Vegas for my buddy's wedding and happened (or, more accurately, drunkenly stumbled upon) this place, it was game on.   Located inside Planet Hollywood, Bugr has the now trademarked glass enclosed fire that Gordon Ramsay seems to enjoy a little too much. (I'm not saying that Ramsay is an arsonist, but if one of his restaurants burned down I think we can all agree he's a preeeeeety good suspect.)   I went on a Sunday afternoon around 1 and it was packed. The line snaked around the perimeter of the restaurant, and many of the bigger parties left because of the 45 minute wait time.  Smaller parties, like mine, waited about 20 minutes. The hostesses were extremely courteous and polite, which I imagine can not be easy when you consider the the sheer number of drunken assholes trying to grab them inappropriately. I don't necessarily know why Vegas (and Bugr is no exception)  feels the need to put every woman working in the town in a short/tight/skimpy outfit, though. I get it if I'm at the Spearmint Rhino, but at Bugr? It just seemed a little unnecessary. However,  that being said - wooo! I love boobies, so maybe I'm being a bit disingenuous.    After our short wait we spent pondering gender inequities in modern society (cause, you know, were deep like that and stuff) we were escorted to our table. There is a giant touch screen menu on the exterior of the restaurant, so we already had a fairly good idea of what we wanted. The menu is fairly small with maybe a dozen burgers, (some chicken, fish, and vegetarian options available), a few hot dogs, some appetizers, a handful of salads and a smattering of milkshakes. I went with the farm burger, which had duck bacon and a fried egg, and my buddy had the hell's kitchen burger. We also ordered the Parmesan truffle  and sweet potato fries. To start we had jalapeno poppers. Those jokers may have been the highlight of the meal. They are served in individual dipping cups in case you're worried about getting cooties from your dining companions, and come with a bacon cheddar sauce. One of the six does not have the seeds removed which makes for a fun game of intestinal Russian roulette, especially if someone in your party can't handle a little spice. The fries were OK. The truffle Parmesan were a little too crispy for me, closer to being burned. The sweet potato fries had some seriously delicious dipping sauce accompanying them. I think it was honey mango chipotle flavored or something like that. The burgers are fantastic. My first bite literally melted in my mouth. The duck bacon was an interesting component, but ultimately,  it was overpowered by the burger itself. I saw some kid next to me put ketchup on his burger and it was all I could not to snatch him  out of his chair. You should NEVER  put any condiment on a good burger or steak; the meat speaks for itself. (Sidenote: who brings their kids to Vegas? You mean your kid will appreciate a trip to the land of debauchery and excess more than a trip to Disneyworld? You could be having pictures with Micky and dinner with Goofy, but instead your kid has pictures with penis impersonators -seriously happened - and dinner with Chardonnay,  the stripper?! Parenting fail.)   Overall, Bugr is a great place. The wait staff, particularly Chris, was phenomenal and friendly and the burger was great. The price is comparable to other Vegas locations and you can knock eat at a celebrity chef's restaurant of your fatboy bucket list. Its not the best burger I ever had, but its close."}
{"text":"I have been searching for the perfect burger for a while now, and I have my top pick for all that is burger at a little place called Maple & Motor, located in Dallas, TX. It's legit, and make no mistake, I can't exactly compare the two, so I'm going to claim a new favorite burger... outside of Texas! Yes, I know... there will be some dissenting views and opinions, but the world has much to offer and Gordon Ramsay has done it right in Las Vegas with his latest creation. It's BurGR time!  This particular night we went to BurGR, we had just left seeing Penn & Teller at the Rio, where we were staying.  Knowing full well that we probably couldn't eat late on a Monday night, I suggested we go anyway to Planet Hollywood and see where the place was first and then just spend some time gambling in the casino.  Turns out, we got there by 11 and the restaurant was still serving.  We hadn't eaten since Noon, and figured why not? Let's eat now!  Not knowing where we were going exactly other than Planet Hollywood, I'll go ahead and say the one negative about out experience, and then I'll move on.  The restaurant had only been open for about 3 months, and the signage in the hotel had not been updated to reflect where exactly the hell it was.  As tourists, we figured it would be simple to locate, but Planet Hollywood has a shopping mall behind it called the \"Miracle Mile,\" and it really is about a mile long in diameter of retail shops located behind the hotel. With this said, finding someone to help, much less give you directions when the mall area is closing, as well as the long walk to the front of the hotel where BurGR is located, is a bit much with no signage or any sense of direction, but after a few minutes of parking and asking a few questions, we finally made it to our destination.   When we arrived, the hostess was awesome and excited that we had come to join them for a fantastic meal.  She said, \"I have a couple of servers working, but I have the perfect guy for you.  He's awesome, and you're really going to have a great time!\" This set the tone for the night, and we were not let down.  We sat down, got our menus and began looking them over, while looking at all of the wonders the restaurant had to offer in regards to decoration and experience.  Next thing I know, a guy named Alex (with glasses) walks up, says \"Hello,\" and thus began our journey to Awesomtown.   A glass of wine and a Boddington's for myself were quickly ordered.  The menu was fully explained, and then we were given a few minutes to decide.  There was little debate for the both of us, as we both quickly found our favorites.  My Mom decided on the Hell's Kitchen Burger (Asadero cheese, jalapenos and avocado) and I chose the Farm Burger with duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar and a fried egg.  We also decided to split a side of truffle Parmesan fries with truffle salt, truffle aioli and chipotle ketchup with molasses. Wow!  The burger was served medium rare with a solid  1/2 pound of a chuck, short rib and brisket mix.  The 600-degree wood burning grill gives the meat a texture like no other and the apple and alder wood gave an amazing smoke flavor.  This burger was juicy, flavorful, a bit glamorous to taste, but with a bit of a backyard feel that made me love every bite.  It was simple.  No dressing, no veg and a made from scratch daily sesame seed bun that was to die for.   What could possibly make this any better? Yes, those previously mentioned truffle Parmesan fries.  They were amazing, and the truffle aioli spread that came with them, I could have eaten by the spoonful and had been satisfied.  Turns out that night at Midnight, Alex (with glasses) was having a birthday.  We started talking and I told him about my Mom's birthday, where we were from and why we were there.  Next thing I know, the manager Emily from the restaurant came by, and then Alex (with glasses) brought us out an amazing treat to share with him for his birthday.  I never would've thought prior to my night at BurGR that I would ever enjoy this particular dessert, but we were brought a salted peanut ice cream and chocolate maple pudding cake, served push up style.  All I can say is, \"Damn, that was a tasty treat!\"  I'm officially claiming this Burger Hunt as the best I've ever had, outside of Texas.  The greatest I have experienced in the Lone Star state still hands down is Maple & Motor, but I would be hard pressed to claim a winner if these two establishments were in the same town.  The style and atmosphere is 180 degree opposite of each other, but the food doesn't lie.  Great burgers and great people serving up something they believe in always wins.  Well played, Gordon Ramsay! You're not just another TV chef with attitude anymore in my eyes.  Now that I have experienced what you have to offer, I have a whole different respect for what you've accomplished in your life.  Till next time my friends... stay hungry and keep on the hunt!"}
{"text":"If you visit Las Vegas this is a must try! Hog Burger is bomb! All the different flavorings put together are very tasty! All the fries are good! You also have to have a shake! Its not your typical ice cream shake...its like a dessert! It has a layer of custard pudding or caramel pudding consistency with the chocolate or oreo ice cream shake together! (depending which flavor you choose). The best shakes i have ever had! Its a gourmet \"fancy\" shake! Its located in Planet Hollywood. Theres always a line but its worth the wait! Theres Miracle Miles mall to shop around, las vegas blvd entrance is right there to sight see, and the casino you can gamble so the wait goes by really fast! They text your phone when your table is ready! You have 10 minutes to check-in once they text you. Great technology!  We went to J.Lo show after, down the hall. I highly suggested you eat or check in at least 2 hours before the show starts.  I have also taken children. They allow kids:) There is no take out orders or ordering by phone. Dine-in only. Prices match what you get. Not too expensive but you do pay more for gourmet! Burgers around $15, fries around $10, and shake around $10!"}
{"text":"This is more than a burger restaurant, it's an culinary experience that everyone should enjoy. I really didn't think that it would be that great but it exceeded all of my expectations. It was well worth the 30 minute wait! I at the all American Burger and fries which went great with my drink (B52)."}
{"text":"I can't believe I finally got to try this place last week. It was worth the wait and the food was phenomenal.  It's located inside Planet Hollywood, near front entrance and hard to miss. The enclosed glass fire flame feature really draws your attention, providing the perfect setting and makes a bold statement that this place rocks! The atmosphere is lively and the colorful décor really compliments the space well. There's a huge bar next to the front entrance equipped with flat screen TV for checking out the game.  We got here after 10pm and there was a small line. The wait wasn't too bad, 15 minutes in and we were on our way to burger blitz. Our server was very friendly and got us started on some yummy shakes and refreshing beers.   Crème brulee oreo milk shake was amazing. So rich and ridiculously good....two of my all-time favorite treats infused into shake. Everyone at our table raved how awesome it was. Forget dessert, I just drank it!   We ordered the chanterelle burger and farm burger. The burgers were cooked to perfection and so flavorful. Everything was fresh and juicy. It hardly needed additional sauces or condiments. They were good as is!   Sweet potato fries was scrumptious. It was lightly dusted with powdered sugar and accompanied with honey jalapeno mayo dipping sauce. I bet you can't just eat one...so good!  If you love burgers, I highly recommend you check this place out. The food is a bit pricey, but worth it and portions are just right. Best burger joint in Las Vegas. Looking forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Service was great too!  We had the bleu burger and the turkey burger. Both were outstanding!"}
{"text":"\"Go for a meal\" Service slow hence a 4. The food was excellent. Chicken and beef burgers were amazing and the jalapeño starter as good. The sweet potato and truffle fries were big do sharing even between 3 possible"}
{"text":"Hm... can you really give a \"burger joint\" four starts?? Well I could not give it any less! There is no better way to start you \"next day\" in Vegas.  Gordon did a truly good job setting this place up. There are no hick ups, the service is as fast as it needs to be when you are in the burger mood. Me being a truffle lover their fries is a must. I could actually go here just to eat the truffle fries, but hey, then i would miss out on their burgers!  Burgers are so big there is no way i can eat a whole one, but let me tell you i am trying my best! I like to sit in the bar where you can see the food being cooked. Its a perfect burger-entertainment.   My favorite burger is the Euro Burger. It comes with truffle aïoli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomato. It is like Gordon called me and asked how my dream burger would be composed and then he did it! Ha"}
{"text":"The line can get pretty long, so arrive early or plan to wait. The Hell's Kitchen Burger was really great (as a $15 burger better be)! The truffle fries were okay, but overrated in my opinion. I would also like to see more craft beers on the menu. Our sever, Paul, took good care of us so all in all it was a pretty good meal!"}
{"text":"Ever since I watched a video on someone's experience here and what they got, I've been wanting to come try this place real bad. I finally got the chance to.  I got here around dinner time so about 5:30 and the line was growing long. A server came out and asked us how many people and if we wanted to sit at the small cramped lounge or a table. Of course I opted for a table.  We waited a good half hour or so to get seated. Our server didn't get to us immediately but we knew what we wanted as she brought the ipad menu. I ordered the farm burger. My sister got the hell's kitchen burger. We also got the truffle parmesan fries and a oreo shake with creme brulee pudding.  We told our server to bring our shake first because after reading the reviews on how long it takes to get your burger I figured it's better off starting with dessert.  The shake took about 20 minutes to arrive. I understood cuz the place was packed for a Monday night but regardless of the day I knew this place would always be busy. Anyway the shake was really damn good. One of the best shakes I had in my life.  The bad thing after that was the wait on our food. We ended up waiting nearly 40 minutes total for our burgers and fries to show up.  When I finally got to take my first bite of the burger the egg literally oozed out making a mess. The duck bacon was good but I would've guessed it was regular bacon. Honestly I wasn't blown away by the taste of the burger. I got my burger cooked medium and it was juicy but the flavor was kinda lacking. A little under seasoned.  My sis enjoyed her burger although it was a bit too spicy for her. I took a bite of hers and I got that moderate heat from the roasted jalapeños. My mouth was on fire for a moment. I thought it was an ok burger.  The truffle parmesan fries were really delicious. They came with 2 sauces. One was ketchup with some seasoning and the other was some kind of aioli. I liked the ketchup more overall.   The service here was decent as our drinks were refilled and we got extra napkins.  My only issues with this place was  Food took kinda long for a burger Fries were good but overcooked Prices were high  Overall I did like this place and I would return again."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town and bang for your buck. Plates/ servings are neat and clean as would be expected of Gordon's restaurants.   Jamie our server was excellent and efficient. Ensuring our needs were met throughout our service. Make sure you turn up slightly earlier ahead of the main meals times or be prepared for a wait.   Food came speedily as would be expected.   Hells kitchen burger did not disappoint! Really brings its jalapeño kick! Avacado kept the burger light with a hint of freshness. One of the few times i've had a burger plated so neatly. Did not even come apart whilst slowly working through it.   Burgers do not come with sides, but you can order a side of fries to share. 3 types to choose from and share, sweet potato, truffle and just fries.   Didn't have room for snacks or dessert but by the peeks i had at other tables, they all looked great. Try em and let me know how they tasted!"}
{"text":"We waited 45min to grab and early dinner; we ordered, waited....3 of us got our food; hubby didn't; Manager came over and apologized about the order problem and his food should be out shortly; but it seemed like every waiter that walked by our table kept apologizing about the order mix-up and we felt all other table eyes were on us...food came along with an order of garlic fries.  When it came time to pay, hubby noticed his order wasn't on bill.  Nice.  If we wanted to be the center of attendtion then I would have given a 5 star rating, but other table waiter overload with apologies for a hamburger --- it wasn't stake.   I think it would have been more personal for just our waiter, the Manager and just our table to know what was going on with the order- Not the whole eating area."}
{"text":"The food, theme, vibe of their environment is beyond phenomenal. The restaurant actually feels like \"Hell's Kitchen\". The burgers tasted great and i felt the soul Gordon had put into his work. GREAT JOB GORDON. Their customer service was nice, but they had my girlfriend and I waiting for too long sometimes when it came to checks and ordering."}
{"text":"Had the Farm Burger - duck breast bacon, english cheddar with a fried egg, med rare. It was without a doubt the best burger I've ever had in my life. Can't wait to go back. Service was great and the price was incredibly reasonable."}
{"text":"This was the best burger I've ever had!!!  It was cooked to perfection (exactly the way I like it) and just had great flavor.  The milkshakes are amazing, as well.  The only thing I didn't care for had nothing to do with the food, but I thought it strange to have to share ONE iPad for 6 people to paruse a fairly large beverage menu -- by the time the waitress came back only 3 people had a chance to see the iPad choices and two if those thought they already had ordered it off the iPad!!  Didn't seem very efficient to me.  Everything else though was great!!  I'd definitely pay $14+ for a great burger like this again!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high?   Don't get me wrong..really great menue, good service..just not EXCELLENT. ...so I could not give it 5 stars.   Menue is a bit limited, and nothing about the price impressed me.   Ramsey is great...but needs to come sort out a few issues here"}
{"text":"Sempre que vou para Vegas não deixo de ir no Gordon. Cada vez melhor. Atendimento. Preço e Sabor. Vale a pena conferir"}
{"text":"Sadly, they do not have a veggie burger. I ordered the portobello burger and it was greasy. Like burger greasy and def cooked on the grill that is used for burgers. It was gross with the exception of the bun. The bun had a lot of sesame seeds. Yum. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the parm fries were good. The ketchup is way too vinegary but aioli was good. Way overpriced as well. Would not recommend this place for vegetarians."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY .. Last night we went to have late dinner which was at 11 night time we arrived and it was no line so we head to the hostess and she asked how many of u I said 4 she looked inside and said you have to wait 45 min I looked inside the restaurant and literally there is 9 tables completely empty also the one of the bars had ONLY 2 ppl sitting there so I told her there's plenty of empty tables she replied IN VERY RUDE WAY I can text u when your table is ready I said we can sit in the bar she said IN THE SAME TONE the bar is reserved (which is I'm sure all of you know that there's not such a thing \"reservation on the bar\") . Now as of an business owner and let me make it more clear multiple business owner including 3 very successful restaurants in NY and LA if I get a review like this for hostess let me tell u you will be sent home the next day for good. And for Gordon Ramsy you should fix your restaurant first my friend before u fix others (kitchen nightmare) I think you should consider your restaurant to be in the next season .."}
{"text":"This place deserves 10 stars from me. This fine establishment is the birthplace of my obsession of truffle. Darn you Gordan Ramsey!   But let me tell you my experience at this fine establishment. So since it was my boyfriend's first time in Las Vegas. I wanted to show him around, he noticed so many Gordan Ramsey restaurants he was dyyyyinngggggg to try one. So we went to BurGR (the GR in BurGR stands for Gordan Ramsey btw haha), since it was a weekend we forgot to make reservations, but it's okay we decided to just wait since we were only a party of two so we waited for about 30 mins and we were sat. The wait wasn't so bad, they said they would text us when a table was ready and there's a lot to do while you wait anyways.   So we sat and we were greeted by our server. She was nice, very helpful, she recommended which milkshake to try and yup, it was on point like she said. Then it came down to ordering our burger. I was stuck between the Euro Burger or the Farm Burger. So I ended up getting the Euro Burger since it has truffle aioli something. I wasn't so into truffle before so I wasn't expected a huge truffle kick taste when I tried my burger. I was so surprised, the Euro Burger is so good. And on top of that, the truffle fries I got was even better with truffle aioli sauce. IT WAS MFING TRUFFLE ON TRUFFLE. My taste buds were dancing foreals. I didn't regret a thing of what I ordered and so worth the wait.  Overall, my boyfriend and I loved it and DEFINITELY be back to dine here again the next time we go to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was on point definitely up to GR's standards. The sweet potato fries were the star of the night. Close second were the jalapeño bites I had the burger with the pork belly it was so good. The only thing I would say is that medium rare was more rare than I normally eat and those who chose the medium option it was more well then medium. Very impressed with management and our waitress. Was visited by both mgrs and asked about our service and food. Our waitress was extremely informative about our food options and everyone that presented a dish made me feel as if i was on top chef or Hell's Kitchen. Will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I recently dined here for a late dinner. There was a line but it moved very quickly. The service was great and everyone was friendly. We were starving when we got there so we ordered right away! The burgers are obviously delicious and there are plenty to choose from-including non beef items. The burgers do not come with a side so my fiancé and I got a side of sweet potatoe fries to share. The fries were accompanied by a delicious aioli dipping sauce and powdered, vanilla sugar. We waited for about 20-25 minutes for our food, so not bad. Overall I would come here again, I'm a Gordon Ramsey Fan!"}
{"text":"Good burger cooked to order, fries only ok.  The flavored ketchup was weird to me.  I asked for the plain one.   The place if very busy especially on weekend.  I wait over 40 minutes to be seated.  Service was good.  I liked it the first time I went but the second time I was not as impressed.  The shine has wore off.  But over all one of the better burger place on the strip."}
{"text":"Crunchy light memorable onion rings, juicy tender flavorful beef patty, and soft sweet bun.  What more could I ask for?    Burgr cooks up a great burger.  Flavors and toppings were balanced and tasty.  The Hell's Kitchen burger has a nice jalapeño bite cooled down by the avocado and cheese.  The Euro was a cheeseburger unlike any I've had.  The aioli sauce and goat cheese made the burger explode with a flavors.    The bun to meat ratio was perfect, and the brioche bun provided a slight sweet, soft, chew to compliment everything inside.   Most memorable were the onion rings...eat them while their hot!!!   Tried the truffle oil fries...they were ok.  I love thick wedge fries, but for the price and hype, I was expecting sensational, exceptional..not so much.   Definitely would go again.  I'll make sure to get fries without the truffle oil nonsense."}
{"text":"Coincidentally I had marathoned Gordon Ramsays shows and developed a mild obsession in the weeks before my vacation to Las Vegas.  I was overjoyed when I realized that my hotel, Planet Hollywood, was home to Chef Ramsays affordable burger joint.  We came in at 1:30 am on Friday and enjoyed not having to wait. Our service was friendly and the food was amazing.  I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger.  It was tasty but the grilled jalapeño it came with was way way way too hot.  I'm just going to assume this was one of those flukey hot jalapeños.  Usually I have no issue chomping down a jalapeño pepper but this was the hottest thing I have ever eaten... My whole throat burned.   I pulled the pepper out and enjoyed the rest of my burger.  Our table scarfed down the truffle fries too.    Saturday we came in for lunch and there was a wait.  There were 4 of us though, so we could give them our number and then meander through the casino, which really helped.  The Oreo shake is AMAZING.  It's rich but its like heaven through a straw.  The farm burger was yummmmy as were the onion rings.  None of us had a single complaint about anything!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the service!  The line was a little long, and the hostess came out, took our phone number, and texted us when our table was ready.  What a concept!!!!  We were able to walk around PH and even catch the 3rd quarter of the Sunday Night Football game around the corner in the Extra bar.  When we were seated we had several servers and the manager check in on us during our meal.  The meal was wonderful too.  My husband had the euro burger and raved about every bite.  I had the Damnation Chicken burger that was packed full of the flavor of buffalo wings.  The blue cheese was perfect!  The fries are separate and I read several reviewers complain about this...if that's something that bothers you, you will probably not appreciate this place so don't bother.  The truffle fries were amazing, and would be perfect serving for 4 people.  We had tons left over!  I can't forget to comment on the drinks.  WOW!  The best mixed drinks we've had in Vegas.  I had the Ruby's Kiss and my husband had the the whiskey cherry lemonade.  Both were perfectly well mixed.  This is a must stop for everyone."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Tried the Hell's Kitchen burger & euro burger, truffle fries & reg fries all were just delicious. We had eaten at Hoisteins for burgers & these was probably even better for a little less $$$&. Def will eat here again when in Vegas"}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced... as is most of Las Vegas.  The Uber Cheeseburger was decent but nothing special and certainly not worth $15.  $11 french fries were bland.  Frankly not worth the truffles.  Had the Hog Snack appetizer... tasty but again, not worth the expense.  I'm a fan of Ramsey's BBC show.  Hate the American version.  Had to try it.  Now that I've tried it, there is no reason to go back.   Next time I'll get a double King at Fatburger and be a much happier man.  $50 better spent at the Bellagio Buffet....  :  Masochist that I am I went to GR's PUB for lunch as well a few days later.  Thought I would try the Authentic Fish and Chips.   $27 for Fish and Chips?  They were fine but I got a place down a few blocks from where I live that has just as good for around $7.  The Scotch Egg was very very good.  Not Greasy.  Extra bits of bacon really made it worth while.  I know it's Vegas but I long for the Mob Run days when you could get a great steak dinner for under $10."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious! The sweet potato fries were sweet and savory- a perfect combination. The music is so loud- I will never figure out why restaurants make it impossible to carry on a conversation without raising your voice to the point of hollering.  Service was great, and the sticky toffee pudding pops- a little piece of heaven!!  I will be returning here- I would love to try one of the pudding shakes."}
{"text":"I just had a cheeseburger but it was very tasty.  Really enjoyed the presentation of everything being in the industry, especially the jalapeno poppers we ordered as an app.  They were delicious.  We shared a truffle fry it was okay I'm not big into fries though.  Overall a good time, wouldn't have waited in the 2 hour line it had many times in the evenings. It was good."}
{"text":"I got the Farm Burger. It was perfect! The frys are great too. Along with the Cream burleigh and Oreo shack. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just one word, DELICIOUS! Loved the tables and how the height of the chair is. Waiting line to be seated wasn't long at all. 10 minutes on a Saturday afternoon. Best burgers ever! Thanks Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I am so sad I live so far from this restaurant.  I want to eat here every weekend!!!!  Cool atmosphere.  Wait for two was pretty short.  Make sure you check in with hostess when you have a party of three or more otherwise when you have a table for two you just stand in line and wait your turn for a table. (We only waited about 25 minutes)  Our server was real sweet.  I got the Hell's Kitchen burger with the peppers on the side so it wouldn't be too spicy.  Oh lord.  Love love love!!!!!!!  Highly recommend.  My mom got the Hog Burger.  Don't recommend.  It is cooked one way, really raw, greasy and didn't taste like much :/    For desert we had to try the sticky pudding :) it was good.  Not amazing but good.  Our total was $50 for two burgers (no fries), desert, and two drinks.  Not bad I say!!!    I will be back BURGR"}
{"text":"I really had high expectations coming in, and it really was a good experience.  I just think 120.00 for burgers and fries for a family of four is a lot.  If fries were included with the 16 to 19 dollar burgers it would definitely rate four or 4.5 stars.  The Parmesan fries were the family favorite and they went quickly.  We also got the jalapeño poppers for the table and they were spicy for the kids, but we're done pretty well.  If your gonna get a shake I recommend the toffee.  It was almost like eating the best part of a Carmel sundae.  The burgers were very good and cooked as they were ordered and the kids ate them up quickly, no complaints."}
{"text":"5 stars from this yelper! I had the American Burger and truffle fries. It was absolutely the best burger I have ever had. There was a line but even though they said 30 minutes, it was actually 5. Service was quick and efficient. Definitely a must eat place while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We came here 15 minutes before it was open at 11AM and there was already a line forming. We passed by a number of times before and there's always been a line so be prepared to wait!   I got the special off-menu Gordon Ramsay burger. You have a choice of a beef patty or pork patty. I opted for pork and it had avocado, tomato, lettuce, and salsa. I ordered the meat to be medium and it was the perfect amount of pink for me. The sesame bun was so soft and delicious. It complimented the burger so well. The ingredients weren't extravagant, but somehow it was definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had.   Our table ordered the truffle parmesan fries and they were amazing. My friends said they had to savor every bite because it was so good you didn't want it to end. Don't miss out on these delicious fries!  I loved the atmosphere as well. There is a glass wall where there's literally fire burning inside of it, and there's no way you can deny how cool it looks. Can't wait to bring more friends here next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I suppose when it's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant you expect more or better than average. Like everyone else I have watched his shows and he seems to be a passionate chef. There was a 45 minute wait to get a table- that's fair it was a Friday night so we went and killed some time until our text message informed us the table was ready. The staff uniforms are RIDICULOUS, so blatantly inappropriate, ill fitting and unflattering. Please change them- what a joke they are. The umbrella girls at motorpsorts events are wearing more clothes than the poor girls working at BURGR. The burgers took another 45 minutes to come out and they were okay but not great. My husband got the truffle fries with the truffle aioli, which frankly all just tasted like garlic and not much else. I cook for my family most nights so the burgers were not earth shatteringly good or something I couldn't whip up in 15 minutes. i just expected more. Well I did get more when the bill came $150 for 2 adults and 2 kids for a burger meal.  We won't go back to BURGR, but there certainly is a slew of Gordon Ramsay restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas. He seems to be a hard worker and he's making hay while the sun shines."}
{"text":"Great ambience and service... Loved how they had an interactive iPad drink menu and also a survey on the iPhone to take afterwards... Really neat.  Now for the important stuff: felt the food was overrated, we ordered the jalepeno poppers which were our favorite of the night but after that it just went downhill from there. The farm burger is supposed to be served with an overEASY egg so the yolk is all runny but we got a way overlooked egg and missed out on the best part of the burger. The chanterelle burger, supposed to be topped with a lot of mushrooms... There were hardly any on it! And the truffle fries!!! Couldn't eat more than an handful they were way too salty!   Overall, overpriced and overrated! Wouldn't come back here for a 2nd time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burger joints on the LV Strip!! If you're coming to Vegas and you want a quality burger, I would definitely recommend going to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR. Everything about this place reeks of \"sleek\" and \"trendy.\" From the fire lit sign outside to the menus, BurGR is a fantastic spot. There are TVs lined throughout the restaurant so you won't miss a beat if you're watching any live sporting event.  Yes, the lines for this place can be long but you can leave your phone number and they will text you when your table is ready. Since it's located right on the casino floor of Planet Hollywood, you can just play a couple hands of blackjack or test your luck at the craps table while you wait! Heck, you might even eat at BurGR for free if you come up at the tables!  I always pick the farm burger (duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar and a fried egg) and it never disappoints me! The yolk from the egg just oozes out as soon as you take a bite from the burger. The cheese is perfectly melted over the juicy, delicious patty. So gooooood! The burger can get a little messy with the yolk oozing everywhere but that's what makes it so darn delicious! As a table, we split onions rings and the gooey fries. While I wasn't too big of a fan of the gooey fries (too much going on in my opinion and I wasn't really a fan of the thick fry cut; more of wedges), I thought the onion rings were fantastic. The onion rings were HUGE.   While Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is a great place to grab a quality burger, it comes at a price. It's a little on the pricier end of things but then again...what place on the strip isn't overpriced?"}
{"text":"It takes allot for me to give out Five Stars, but Gordon Ramsay you have won me over.   We were in Vegas a few weeks back and were all craving a Gordon Ramsay Burger.   I generally don't go into these celebrity chef establishments with high hopes, as unfortunately they let you down more than they live up the expectations.  GR BurGR did not disappoint though.  First off the hostess takes your number and sends you a text message once your table is ready, which allows you to go have fun in the casino while you wait.  I absolutely love this idea, I highly recommend other busy restaurants follow this lead.   I recently had my Gall Bladder out, so I couldn't partake in the fried food digestion with my friends but they loved the French Fries and thought the Jalapeno appetizer where you get a single random extremely hot one mixed in with the regular poppers was a brilliant idea.  They all got different burgers off the menu and raved about them, I stuck with the Turkey Burger and was extremely happy. It was moist, flavorful and plenty filling.    What goes best with a Burger? The answer is obviously beer and this place has a great selection on draft.   For everyone going to Vegas I can't recommend anything higher, you must check out Gordon Ramsay BurGr."}
{"text":"This a bit of a let down Mr Ramsey! I Watch Your Show Religiously exspected a lot more. The service was terrible,  I decided to sit at the bar and ordered the lamb burger which set me back 19.00 bucks. I was shocked at the presentation when it arrived,  bland and boring nothing to it. Then the server who was tending to me ignored me during my entire stay. I needed some more ketchup and had to flag down a passing bust boy as I couldn't get the attention of my server.  Like I stated this was a big disappointment especially as I stopped by to eat here just before my flight back to new york."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We had the Hells Kitchen and Chanterelle burgers and shared a Just Fries. Excellent flavors! Topped off with Guinness on draft! Highly recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"Two weeks ago, I went for the first time. Got the farm burger and shake #4 (creme brûlée and Oreo milkshake). They were excellent!   Tonight, got the Hell's Kitchen burger. Nice heat, but my burger was charred on one side so all I could taste was the char. I asked for medium well and they gave me almost rare. My friend ordered medium rare and she got rare. Service was slow, but our waitress was nice. It was hard to get a hold of her though.   I let our waitress know about my burger and she kindly took the cost off the total. She re-ordered my friend's burger and half of it came our medium rare and the other half looked rare. What's going on, chef?  Tips: -located inside Planet Hollywood's casino.  -Don't jump in line. Walk past the line and check in with the hostess. They will text you when your table is ready.  -Plan for at least at 30 minute wait on weekdays and 1 hour on weekend nights. Always a wait! -order the farm burger. Best one there. Hell's Kitchen burger was ok. Uber burger is good too, but farm burger is the best.  -Parmesan truffle fries are ok to good. But truffle isn't my favorite thing.  -service is slow. I checked in at 6:30pm on Friday night, got seated at 7:15pm, got our burgers at 8pm, got my tab at 8:50pm. I had a show at 9pm and flagging our waitress down was near impossible.  -Have your Total Rewards membership number to get one dollar off each item (located on your membership card, emails, or account login online).   Been here twice, but will only go here again if my friends really wanted me to go."}
{"text":"Um holy diggly this was the best Vegas meal decision of our lives!! So worth the only 20 minute wait in line (no reservations) on a Sunday evening about 6-7 pm for my husband and I!  Our waiter, unfortunately forgot his name, was extremely helpful and attentive. We ordered Gordon's favorite beer which was very light and had no bitter aftertaste, called Innis & Gunn. We also ordered the butterscotch snicker doodle cookie, banana and walnut shake to share! Omgosh so much yummy goodness.  The truffle Parmesan fries were yummy on the first few bites, but Were not as fresh as I would've liked. I think because they literally fire up a bunch of orders at a time, since it was a hot menu item.  We both did not hesitate to order the Hell's Kitchen burger. SO good, and not too overwhelming. Very doable.  I will definitely come back here and try some other items! A++ Would've been the extra icing on the cake if Gordon happened to be there ;)"}
{"text":"Went to BURGR with friends at the conclusion of a great Vegas bachelorette party weekend. Was definitely not disappointed! The line to get in was really long, but they keep things moving along really well. My burger was delicious, and the truffle fries are excellent."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for the AVN's and my friend and I were starving!  As we were walking through Planet Hollywood I look over and saw BURGER, I was ready to eat, I didn't even know that it belonged to Chef Gordon Ramsay.  I walk up to the lovely ladies in front and they sat us immediately.  it was really busy in there, so it took a minute for our server (Matt) to get to us.  First off you get to keep your menu as a keepsake which is cool.  Second try the shake.  I didn't get one my friend got one because it had pudding in there and to me at the the time, it seemed weird and not appetizing late me say I was wrong!  It has an ice cream shake at the bottom a flavored pudding on top and then fresh whip cream and a cookie on top.  I had some of my Friend's and It was SO GOOD!  I had the Hells kitchen burger.  It wasn't spicy, but it was tasty!  My friend and I shared the Parmesan truffle fries, which my friend loved the house made ketchup I was all about the truffle Aoli.  I also had a draft beer that tasted like Apples, which is my favorite taste in a beer and I had two other drinks a regular raspberry tea ( which was so fresh to me) and a shot called a Baby Guinness which was Coffee Patron with Irish Cream on top, so it looks like Guinness in a shot glass.  That was great.  The staff was great they are always chatting with you and telling you how everything is made at the restaurant from scratch which is important to know that your food does not have any chemicals in it.  I didn't even finish my burger I wanted to take the other half home so I could experience it again.  And it tasted great the second time around.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is WOW!  This restaurant gem is located on the 1st floor of the Planet Hollywood hotel.  I went during dinner time and it gets REALLY crowded fast.  The good thing about this place is that you can put your name and number down and they will give you a call when your table is ready.  This is super convenient because this lets you go do something else (like gamble) without having to wait around a table for 1+ hours.  I also have to praise the decor here as well. The restaurant logo in the front on fire, literally.  There are tiny flames that are ignited to surround the logo to really give that wow factor, (and maybe to emphasize how flame-broiled the burgers are here).  When I get here, we started with the jalapeño poppers and onion rings.  Both were delicious and came out in these amazing plates/containers.  I personally thought the onion rings were much better than the poppers so if I had to choose one, I would get just the rings.  Then I ordered the chanterelle mushroom burger which was cooked to perfection.  The bun is soft and compliments the flavorful meat and toppings.  You can also tell this restaurant is well established because every dish ware here is customized for this restaurant.  Lastly, we also ordered the coffee hazelnut milkshake.  This drink is just AMAZING.  There is a layer of milky coffee on the bottom and there is a thick creamy hazelnut pudding like texture on top.  I believe you mix the two to get the perfect consistency but they also taste so good separately.  One of the coolest and tastiest milkshakes I've had!  To top it off, the service was fast and great and really looked after us because we were sorta in a rush.  Thanks BurGR, I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I ate everything the I could when I came! jalapeño poppers are plentiful and delicious. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and added bacon to it, yum, yum.  my boyfriend ordered the fire roasted chili dog which was unlike any hotdog I have ever eaten. I rarely do hot dogs at an eating establishment but I would order this one. They also have a variety of milkshake options. Staff was super friendly and prompt. The one thing I didn't like was the fact that they had a photographer that would come over to take pictures, I don't like people getting in the way of me eating lol nor do I need to capture the memory of eating a burger."}
{"text":"Just do it. Freakin delicious burgers. Super creative burgers & awesome sweet potato fries! They're definitely sweet but come with a honey Serrano dipping sauce--YUM!   Great beer selection. Of course you pay for the GR name & Vegas location but it's worth it.   Go at off-peak times otherwise you'll wait quite awhile in line. We went around 3:30 & were seated immediately. Otherwise lines are LONG. No reservations."}
{"text":"Ordered the farm burger and the truffle fries...AH-MAZING!   I really wanted to try to find something I didn't like so I can go Gordon-Ramsay on the waiters but I really couldn't. The farm burger's duck fat bacon, sharp cheddar, and the egg blended so well with the soft buns and juicy beef. Furthermore, the truffle fries were out of this world. Perfectly crispy and the truffle spread evenly throughout the whole cup.   Service was friendly but the wait to get in and the wait for the food to come out was long. However, I think it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers. Party of four I dined with and we all tried something different. We were in no hurry, did beverage, appetizers and conversation before moving to entrees. Overall impressed with food. Our waiter was a bit pushy; removed plates and glasses from table before we were finished. One point he grabbed my beer which had a third of a third of a glass left and then returned and offered another beer. One guest had a 1/2 burger left, she was chewing and he offered her a to go box. I politely commented we weren't finished and he needed to take it down a notch. He stared me down before walking away never to return. I ended up getting up 15 + minutes later and speaking to the Manager/Jenn. Told her what had happened and she was very apologetic and seemingly concerned. We did praise the food but felt service needed improvement."}
{"text":"Ok, first off, I love this place.   We waited for about 50 minutes for a table for four on a Saturday night. The wait was so worth it!   Our waiters were really nice - they let us keep the menu for the heck of it (and because we are big fans of Gordon Ramsay).   The burgers. Oh my gosh. So delicious. Worth the $15. We got the farm burger, the Hell's Kitchen burger, and the American burger (something like that). They were all so juicy and tasted like heaven. Our fries, on the other hand, were dry and not so good. Coming from Utah, we eat fries with fry sauce but they had some weird BBQ or something sauce. I'm not totally sure what it was but I did not prefer it.   I'd recommend this to anyone! I'm not a big burger fan but I'm a big fan of this burger!"}
{"text":"Burgr is one of our favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It is located inside Planet Hollywood. You can't miss it, there's a huge fire wall.   The atmosphere is very loud and exciting. Everything is done in bright colors and it's always really, really loud.   The burgers are good and the fries are good, but what we really come for is the jalapeño poppers! My husband and I have searched high and low for anything even remotely similar. When we come we usually order three orders and just eat them all. Something fun about the poppers is that they serve six, and one of them they leave all the seeds in. It's like Russian roulette with peppers! Another wonderful thing to order is one of the shakes, which you can definitely share. The burgers honestly aren't enough for me to return for. If you order the fries which are hugely expensive (13$ for one) you can definitely share. They are massive!"}
{"text":"It was good, after visiting Gordon Ramsays Steak at the Paris, I was expecting this burger to blow me off my seat like at his other restaurant, but it was just a decent burger, nothing to get off your seat and yell \"Oh MY GOD\" over. Their sticky toffee pudding push up pops, MUST TRY!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers and even better service. The man the myth the legend really knows how to treat his guests. You can be sure to receive an excellent meal and waited on better than any 5 star restaurant I've been to on the strip. If your drink is ever close to empty any team member will beat you to the punch before you are parched from your next delicious bite. This spot is a must go to every time I'm here."}
{"text":"First thing is first.  I came here on a Monday night and there was a line already out the door...mind you this was close to 8 at night.  The name Gordon Ramsey is linked with quality and gourmet food. I had high expectations.  I follow Masterchef and Hell's Kitchen so I expected the Ramsey name to bring out the best burger in Vegas. The wait was long. I came solo and tried to get a bar seat but the hostess kept telling me she's checking on it and to stay put. I saw a seat open up but the hostess pretty much ignored me at that point.  I pointed it out to another hostess and she told me to take the seat.  The server at the bar was a beacon of niceness and smiles (think her name was Brenda?) and she turned the mood around.  I decided on the farmers burger which had a beef patty, a bacon with some hinting of duck in it, melted cheese, and a fried egg. I asked it medium prepared. When it came out and I took a bite it was like heaven on a plate. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned to a level I had never tasted. My sensory overload hit extreme awesomeness.   I have never tasted a better burger in Vegas (Burger Bar WAS my spot).  I took a side of onion rings also. Those were crisp and also perfectly cooked. I don't know how they did it but they managed to get just the right level of fried goodness and not burn any part of the onions at all.  By far the best onion rings I have ever eaten.  This definitely is the premiere burger spot in Sin City.  The lone miscue with the hostess was my only minor complaint in an other wise perfect foodie experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I each had a burger and shared a milkshake and sweet potatoes fries. It was plenty of food for 2 people. And you must try one of each. Food was incredible and our server was super friendly and helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"Checked it out figuring it would be good since he is in the business of inspecting/helping out other restaurant owners. The very first thing we noticed was the shivering hostesses and watresses. The place is very close to the outdoor of the building. The girls were freezing! We were told they are not able to put on a sweater or jacket or jeans. They were all very sweet but I felt very uncomfortablewith them being so cold. The outfits were embarrassing...so short anfd tight they had to wear thongs underneath, I could the outline. The service was good and they were very nice. The dogs looked really great! The burgers were smallish and ok!!! The drinks were very small for the prices. The fries were fine but super expensive and not that worth it. Really? How much do potatoes cost? Ihave to say I wasn't very impressed and felt reallybad for those girls!!! Comeon and adapt the uniform so they can be comfortable in the winter months."}
{"text":"Best burger EVER! Had the Hell's Kitchen burger and Jalepeno Poppers. The poppers were really spicy ( and I like really HOT food) and I have not a single complaint about either one. Will probably be stopping by every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fans of Ramsey so we couldn't wait to try it out. There was a line but it moved fast and we were in within 10 minutes.   Once seated our waiter came right over and was super nice. Had an iPad to view the menu which was awesome. Then told us we could keep our paper menus for souvenirs.   Our burgers came out within 30 minutes and we ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Euro Burger.  The burgers were both absolutely delicious. Unique in their own way and couldn't have chosen a better place. At $14-16 per burger it was very reasonable for Vegas and we'd definitely go back. Nice Job Gordon!"}
{"text":"Did not expect much but was VERY happy I ate here.  Ended up being the best burger I've eaten.  Got an American burger and added bacon (actually was Duck bacon - sounded nasty but was actually good - although I prefer pork bacon).  The bun was super-fresh.  The temperature was ordered medium and was delivered perfectly!   Overall it was worth the celebrity hype - I'd come back again for a really amazing burger."}
{"text":"Amazing burger..had the Hell's Kitchen burger with truffle fries..best fries I have ever had, meat was very juicy and tender..recommend to everyone"}
{"text":"TRUFFLE BURGER IS THE JAM.   Farm burger was also delicious but I'd always order the truffle.   Buns were soft and the perfect size. Meat was well seasoned and high quality.   Sweet potato fries were a nice side to the burgers. Sauces are made in house, even their ketchup.  Nice service, pretty restaurant, not too bad of a wait in line and for food on a Tuesday night, service was friendly."}
{"text":"We really liked this burger joint....These days burgers are all the rage in Vegas and you have lots places to try...BURGR does not disappoint!  The only reason I knock off a star us because somehow a burger lunch for 2 created a $95 bill. ..but at least we really loved our meal! We ordered a couple of drinks and started with the Jalapeño Poppers...freaking wonderful! Nicely presented and delicious though pretty hot so be prepared..loved em! Also ordered the Truffle Parm Fries..also fantastic with fresh made catsup and curry sauce...great! I had the Farm burger with a fried egg on it....LOVED it! Friend had a Blue Cheese burger that he said was great ..and he is really picky! Service was just fantastic from start to finish. .and they give you an iPad menu which adds to the uniqueness of this restaurant! There was a really positive energy level here and we liked it alot...noticed the other patrons really seemed to as well. We will definately come here again! (Visited in July 2013)"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing burger and service. Ordered the duck bacon burger and chanterelle mushroom burger. Was so excited with high hopes. Burgers came out super dry even though we ordered medium well! Server told us this was \" normal\" for medium well. Huh?? Since when is medium well dry as a desert? Five guys burger owns this place for a fractjon of the price. Truffle fries was the only redeeming item. Presentation overall is lovely but taste and execution horribly disappointing. As Ramsey would say \"bloody hell! This deserves only one star!\""}
{"text":"I rarely review places but the farmhouse burger was the best burger I've ever had. It didn't need any condiments and I'm def a ketchup girl."}
{"text":"When I arrived I expected a long wait, but they were able to seat us immediately at the bar. Drinks were a little pricey, but SO good. I chose the Antioxidant, and then wanted a brew. The bartenders were excellent, asking what beers I typically ordered and allowed me to sample some of their recommendations.  For my meal I went with the Kale Cesar Salad. The apple slices in the salad made it light and crunchy. My friend and I also split the truffle fries. They were almost TOO good, even good leftover (I don't know how we had leftovers in the first place.) I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A great place for people who like burgers and even great for people who don't care for them. The mix of flavors are as simple or as complex as you'd like and the menu is small enough to prevent the 'paralysis of choice' that many people face when they don't have an idea of what they want.   The restaurant is located immediately in the front of Planet Hollywood with a large sign. However, there is no signage or indication of where it is in the Casino area itself if you're approaching from the Miracle Mile mall. We got lost a couple times on the way in and actually had to leave the casino to get our bearing. You'd expect a hot ticket venue like BurGR to at least warrant some signage in the Casino, but apparently the only thing listed is the buffet.   One piece of advice: Make a friend or two before you go in or say hi to random strangers!  There are essentially two lines to get into BurGR. One line, which is usually empty unless there is an event, is for the 3+ parties. This group is either seated immediately or have to wait a couple of minutes. The other line is for parties of only 1-2 people with a MUCH longer line and wait time. While the number of 2-top tables is the vast majority of the restaurant, the number of couples far exceeds this which can lead to half hour to hour waits. Honestly, I never understood why people in the line didn't just turn to the people behind them and ask \"Hey, you want to share a table?\" and shave time off their wait and split the check.   Service was excellent. When asked questions we were given clear and concise answers. When asked for recommendations they were able to quickly provide both the 'most popular' and 'personal favorite' with a detailed description going beyond the menu that clearly showed some personal experience with the dishes. Our table was constantly watched without being intrusive and the moment our drinks emptied or got low they swooped in and refreshed it so we always had something on hand. Though the fact that we didn't order any alcoholic drinks may have contributed to the quick turnaround as it is easier to fill up soda, ice tea, and lemonade than a cocktail. After we ordered we were told that it would take 20 minutes to be ready and the food was on the table at 19 minutes.   If you're expecting 'big portions' or full plate you WILL be disappointed. However, don't scoff at what you're getting as it will pack a punch. The burgers are simple and packed with a rich variety of flavors that leaves you both wanting more and feeling satisfyingly full at the end. You will have to order fries or sides extra, but the extra attention to the sides makes them somewhat worth the price.   Personally I got the Truffle Burger (on our server's recommendation) and it was a very simple burger with almost garlic buttery overtones from the truffles. It is surprisingly simple and filling for having a singular theme to it. I cut mine in half and after eating part of it just sat there for a while savoring the flavors that lingered in my mouth for a while. If I rushed it and ate it in one go I probably would've found it a bit small and heavy, but taking it slow made it more enjoyable and filled me up from just how rich it was spaced out over time.   All in all I suggest going to BurGR and enjoying the experience. Perhaps I was lucky, but from how packed it was it seems like it's not just the name drawing people in."}
{"text":"In his TV shows, you might find Gordon Ramsey shouting \"Hell No!\", however this burger place is a \"Hell Go!\"  Located in Planet Hollywood this burger joint serves up large (7oz) burgers that take 30 minutes to cook.  That's right, a full half hour, not to mention the wait in light.  However, if you have the time, it's worth the wait.    The burgers here are juicy, meaty, and topped with delicious toppings like duck breast bacon and roasted jalepeno peppers.  As far as sides go, their fries come with 2 types of ketchup, one chiptole, one curry.  While this might upset the purists, the flavor profiles really work.  If you're super hungry, they also served fries covered in gooey melty cheese and a fried egg.  To save on your wait times, talk to the hostess in the front and she'll enter your phone number into their system.  Instead of waiting in line for 45 minutes, our ticket was called in about 5."}
{"text":"If anyone has seen GR on TV, then you know he expects the best food & service when it comes to his restaurants.  So, I figured this would be a great place to have a lunch meeting with some business associates. It started off great, got seated fairly quickly and ordered some appetizers that came out hot, fresh and delicious.  It was then on to our entrees, I ordered the Hog Burger because why not it sounded delicious and it was.  Everyone else loved what they ordered and had no complaints.  We also ordered truffle fries for the table which they forgot and quickly corrected when we brought it up and even took it off the bill since they brought it to the table when we were pretty much finishing up our meals. Definitely would come back when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"There was a long wait, which I don't mind if the food is worth it. Let me tell you, I didn't mind the wait at all. The hells kitchen burger was quite possibly the best burger I have ever had. It was cooked to perfection. The truffle fries were also excellent.  The homemade catchup was pretty good but the truffle aoili that accomanied it was absolutely amazing! I would put that stuff on anything! I would highly reccomend this place."}
{"text":"So I have watched this man's shows and have always wonder how his food would taste.  This weekend my partner and I thought we give it a try.  So we stopped by BurGR at PH Resort.  The customer service is actually very good, our waiter went out of his way to get my partner his favorite drink so that was awesome, plus he was super hot! (the waiter)  Anyway, we ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the sweet potato fries.  The fries were actually really good, sprinkled with powder sugar served in a metal cone.  The burger left something to be desired for.  The presentation was, well Bla!  The burger was small and not very mind blowing or what you would expect from such a renowned chef.  The patty was actually very dry, that it was hard to swallow the burger, I had to take a sip of water every time.  The flavors were all there it had the potential of being a good burger but it was just so dry, I mean DRY!  If this had been served on his tv show, he would have thrown it in the trash.  We order two margaritas to accompany our burger, the margaritas were actually the best part of the meal, they were delish.  Again our waiter was awesome and went out of his way to get my partner a jalpeno margarita, perfectly spiced!  And why am being so catty about a burger?  Well 2 burgers and two margaritas and 1 order of fries, $90 tip and tax include of course."}
{"text":"I'm such a huge GR fan that when I found out via Yelp he had a burger restaurant in Vegas, I knew it was going to be a must stop. After filling up my Fat Tuesday drink and walking the strip in a drunken hunger, my man and I ordered two GR burgers to go, refilled ours drinks and hit the strip back to our telly.   Can I just say, wow. Wow! Hands down one of the next burgers I've had, and that's coming from a gal dating a burger master. Such jam packed flavors, a wonderfully seeded bun, the freshest lettuce, and a patty that melted in your mouth upon biting into it. I absolutely adore cooked to order burgers and did I mention we added bacon?   I'm happy to finally have tasted some GR food after watching so many of his shows. This place is a definite must go to for every trip that I make to Vegas."}
{"text":"My wife and I checked this place out.  GR has a good rep so we were excited to go.  The atmosphere and branding were all spot on.  We ordered the onion rings, the truffle fires and we both got the Hell's kitchen burger.  The onion rings were poor at best.  They have so much better around the onion that you barely could taste it.  It was also a little on the soggy side.  The fries were good.  Flavor was good and the sauces that came with it (i forgot them already) enhanced the flavor.  The burger was good.  I added a fried egg to mine and it made the difference.  The only knock on the burger is that if it is a  \"Hell's Kitchen\" burger (I am assuming that it has to be spicy) that it in fact has some heat.  It barely raised the temp.  The only heat i got was when I ate have the pepper in one bite.  With all the options there are in Vegas, probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"3.5/5. We snagged a table for 2 after less than 10 minutes in line on a Monday night. I know it's Vegas, but having your waitresses in unflattering spandex dresses that are less than a centimeter from baring their bottoms is unnecessary and a bit unsanitary. We were quickly approached by our waitress with an iPad for the drinks. She was good throughout and came to fill waters and check on us a few times.  We ordered the jalapeño poppers to start which came with one 'fiery' surprise that absolutely ruined your palette for the next 20 minutes. While the poppers came out less than 5 minutes from order, the burgers took over 30 minutes to arrive. I had the Farm burger with came with duck bacon, cheddar, and a fried egg. It was tasty but super heavy and not for the faint of heart. The boy had the Yardbird with chicken and bbq sauce which was also okay. We opted to skip the fries, but at $10 an order and $15 for the burger, it does make for an expensive meal for what it is. Had we not done steaks the evening before, I would say it would be more worthwhile to do that instead."}
{"text":"Amazing milk shake.  Great Burgers.  Its on par with all the other specialty burger restaurants, like Umami Burger and Father's Office. I'm giving it 4 stars because I'm waiting for one of these places to really outshine the others so i can give a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I loved GORDON RAMSAY BurGR! We went on a Wednesday night so the wait was only about five minutes. We sat and were given an iPad full of choices of booze and a little fold out menu for the food.  BurGR has a very decent craft beer selection, which pleased me. I had a Squatters Hop Rising and a Stone Ruination, both on tap. We also ordered the fresh roasted jalapeño poppers. Man, those poppers were good, but way too frickin hot for me. And I had chapped lips to boot! Ouch!  For the main course I had the simple Gordon Ramsay Cheeseburger and an order of the Sweet Potato Fries. The burger was excellent! But those fries were served with a shaker of powdered sugar and chipotle mayo. They were easily the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.  Between great beer choices, bomb sides and hearty burgers... I'm a fan!   4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I take eating pretty damn seriously, especially when I travel outside of my local area.  I \"train\" for the trip like any athlete would for a big game. I do weeks of research (no, seriously), read reviews, examine menus, even ask friends for feedback just to ensure I compile a more than awesome list of MUST EATS during my trip.  Anyway, with the bevy of gastropubs and burger joints Vegas has to offer, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR wasn't even a speck on my radar.  GRB didn't pique my interest until a friend said they made their burgers with deckle-meat. Deckle-meat..the buttery, fatty, extra marbly outskirts of that delicious ribeye.GRB quickly made it to the top 3 on my hitlist.   So after having somewhat dieted all day -- told you I took these experiences seriously- I was more than prepared to sink my teeth into one of these burgers.   The restaurant itself isn't anything notable. Orange-themed and contemporary, down to the silverware. Service was fine, attentive and friendly.   The menu isn't so lengthy that you would need to spend 20 minutes deciding on an order, BUT all the options appeared so appetizing that it certainly took about 17 minutes to finally come to some decisions. My boo is very steak and potatoes, doesn't deviate much from culinary fundamentals.  He ordered the American burger, added bacon I believe.  Since I knew I would be able to steal a few bites, I got the fresh roasted chili dog. And yes, I did order this a bit for the shock value since I had seen yelp photos of this particular item. Our buddy got himself the farm burger which is something I would have ordered if I wasn't so interested in that hotdog. We also got regular and truffle parm fries.  We also got shakes. Man did we get shakes. If I were to pick only one item off this menu and nothing else, I would get a shake from here. i used to walk all the way to cosmo for a Holstein's shake but the GRB shakes are exponentially better. Like to the umpteenth power.  I got myself the coffee shake with hazelnut pudding, which I killed in literally 2 minutes. I couldn't keep my hands off it. It was a freakish newfound addiction. Our friend got the Oreo and creme brulee shake which was just as sinfully, almost painfully delicious.   Our food came and the burgers were juicy, rich and what you would expect from the deckle claim. Although since it was thrown into ground beef, it didn't impart a noticeably different flavor.  Burgers were also on the smaller end of the spectrum especially given the higher price point.  My man enjoyed the hotdog more than I did. Other than the hotdog length far exceeding the bun, it wasn't memorable.   The truffle parm fries were piping hot and very generous on the toppings. Wish the fries were cut slightly thinner to lessen their density.   Overall, we were quite satisfied with our meals.  I may even venture to say that I enjoyed it more than Holstein's.  Dang those shakes really got me."}
{"text":"Based on this restaurant, Gordon Ramsey is not yelling at his staff enough.  I did not think British food could have a worse reputation until I came here.    Basically beach food : burgers, hot dogs, wings, shakes.  The hot dog was served with a gigantic amount of yellow mustard (French's?) and ketchup.  Gross.   My first and last time at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  He goes on the list with Guy Fieri for celebrity chefs to avoid.    Popular place - long line waiting to eat here."}
{"text":"Pros: Open late, 2AM on Friday. Good service, food came out at a reasonable time.   Cons: 30-minute wait at 11:30PM. I ordered the Fish Sandwich and it was fishy so I didn't eat it. My friends were not thrilled about their burgers. I think the only decent burger was the Farm Burger with the duck bacon and fried egg.The fries came with two gourmet ketchups. I cannot remember one but I definitely remember the other. Don't get me wrong, I love indian food but this tomato + curry flavor was all wrong! I have had curry ketchup before but this one was not balanced. So I ordered a regular ketchup and all I could say think was I want some Heinz dangit!  Final Impression: For the price and the famous name, it didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Vegas has great food. It really does. And you can also get great food super late at night, which is necessary for late nights, but thankfully rarely an option where I live. My waistline spoke for me.   BurGR has great burGRs.  I got the American burger and split some truffle Parmesan fries with my friend. The burger was a perfect balance of ingredients. The patty is thick and juicy, really one of the best simple burgers I've ever ordered. The l/t/o were crisp and fresh. The cheese was just the right amount of melted.   The truffle parm fries deserve their own paragraph. They were so effing delicious I found myself taking smaller bites to extend the life of our basket. They. Were. Great.   There is only so much I can say when I order a normal burger and fries, but I'm confident it's one of the best burgers I'll have...until I come back again. Chef Ramsey never skimps on quality. This casual eatery is no exception.   The location is bustling. You're right at the entrance of Planet Hollywood, the street entrance, and you'll spot it by the flames that create the side of the restaurant. We sat at the kitchen bar and got to watch the magic happen."}
{"text":"Awesome wings.... service was great.  burger is unreal The fries r great with homemade catchup."}
{"text":"Is it me or was it weird to send food back at a GR restaurant.    I want to first say that I am an avid fan of GR tv and. I was so pumped to eat at my first GR restaurant.  And to top it off ir was a GR burger joint.  Heaven is all I could think.  So I paid the $15 for cab down to Planet Hollywood Casino and after about 30 minutes found the holy land.  There it was BURGR.  And to add to the excitement there sitting there enjoying GRBURGRS was all 50 miss America pageant contestants.  (I assume it was all 50 I didn't want to seem creepy by standing there counting them all).  The restaurant itself is completely what what you would imagine/  Modern, Sleek, Clean/  The Waitress/hosts were delightful.  Unfortunately, that is about where all the compliments have to end.  The first thing i ordered was the onion rings.  They came out shortly after and were sopping in grease.  Yes grease. Onions Rings !!!!! Greasy.  So sad i must say.  The waitress came by and asked how it was and i had to be honest and sent them back.  Yes i had the nerve to send food back at GRBURGR.    Next was my burger.  It was beautiful, cooked to perfection but had absolutely no flavor.  It was like taking raw ground beef, cooking it up throwing it on a bun and serving it.  No salt, No pepper, No flavor.    I ate my BURGR, drank my Drink, finished my replacement fries, snapped a few unobvious pictures of the MS America girls and promptly left, thoroughly disappointed.  Maybe i thought it would be better ...  Maybe with the 50 Ms America girls, the chef didn't care about me ... Maybe they were totally swamped ...  Maybe i am just making up excuses because i really wanted to like this place.  Maybe i am being too hard expecting too much ...  But this is one time , what happened in Vegas, Didn't stay in Vegas.  I'm completely bummed ..."}
{"text":"Pork belly bao buns were decent, though not the best. But their euro burger was delicious! Truffle Parmesan fries with aioli dip was perfect. And their shakes topped with pudding is a genius invention. Everything was delicious! Eat here."}
{"text":"Mix between 3 and 4 stars. Let me explain why!  Went here with many relatives since they've watched Hell's Kitchen before and were curious of how the food actually tasted like. We ordered a few different burgers and dishes. The ones that tasted good were the food that I munched off of my parents' dishes instead of my own.  I myself am not a big burger fan. But my brother wanted to try it so much so I followed suit. I ordered the honey-pig buns and the chicken burger sliders (both as the snack dishes). Both were Mehh ( a true 3 stars on both of these dishes)  Chicken sliders: really dry for some reasons; if there was a little more of the sauce, it would have added itself another star in my book. The buns were grilled a little too burnt (I could taste the burnt part- blehh) Not really that good. The chicken was tender enough though, that was probably my favorite part.  Honey-Pig Buns: the bun was soft and the pork part was tender and tasted like it really was glazed with honey (in a good way), however, to me, the pickle part made the whole dish tasted weird... like its taste didn't compliment the pork bun at all. So 3 star.  My mother used her motherly instinct that assumed I can eat a lot and that I want to try her dish, so before I could even voice my opinion, she cut for me almost half of the portion of her fish and chip dishes and made me eat them. However, IT WAS REALLY GOOD. The fish was soft and marinated well. If I come back to this, I would definitely get it again!  My brother absolutely LOVEDDDD the Farm Burger. But since he sat too far from me I couldn't steal any piece so no comment from me. But It's something I can make my hubby get it so I can try some :P   Waiters are very nice and friendly; convenient location; but for a restaurant made with recipes from a famous chef, it could be better."}
{"text":"The name Gordon Ramsey is synonymous with delicious Gourmet... And his Burgr restaurant is beyond any star rating I can give .. if you come here you will set a standard that may never be reached .. A hamburger is no longer a hamburger but now forever will be known to me as Burgr."}
{"text":"GReat burgers at GReat prices. Stays open till late. The best part is the eclectic choice of gourmet burgers that live up to the hype around celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsay ( I do not suppose he is behind the kitchen screaming choicest words at his sous chefs!). Been there twice- and just for the juicy patties, the soft sesame buns and fresh ingredients that make the Vegas experience from bla to good. The southwest burger is really really good (I prefer chicken).  My rant that keeps it away from 5 stars- The servers are very snooty somehow! The staff looks overburdened from serving all the weary Vegas crowd. Part of the reason why they first handed out an Ipad for looking through the menu- to minimise human contact. It takes a long time for them to serve you but the wait is well- worth it. I'd go again- for the BurGRs."}
{"text":"The burgers were good but they weren't amazing.  I rather go to in n out and save myself a couple of bucks"}
{"text":"We went to Burgr for dinner on a Sunday evening.  There was 20 minute wait to be seated. It seems to be popular.  As a vegetarian I was not keep on a burger joint and the menu has only 1 burger for vegetarians, the Earth Burger ( portabello mushroom burger ). I am not a fan of portabello mushroom, the kitchen obliged me with a grilled cheese with veggies and their mango chutney.  It was fantastic. I would recommend that again. The staff was courteous and accomodating and so was the kitchen staff. Do give it a try, even if you are vegetarian."}
{"text":"Awesome!!  The burgers were delicious. We had to come here and it didn't fail. Our only problem was that we ordered too much fried dished. That's our fault though. Each dish was great. The onion rings were awesome. Truffle oil parmesan fries were on point. The Hell's Kitchen burger and the Euro burger were both really juicy. Different but equally great. We loved it."}
{"text":"Could've been a 5 star rating but the 20 min wait in line plus 30-40 min wait for the food knocks it down one star. Sorry Gordon.  Went here on a Sunday night for dinner with friends. We all got greedy and ordered ONE burger and all of their fries. Yeah. Greedy. Haha.   Ordered:   Euro Burger: truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomato. Huge portion! I like my meat pink. Yeah judge me. But it's so juicy and the taste of the goat cheese, truffle and arugula just blends into some kind of goodness.   Fury Chicken Wings: Ok this is not for kids! It has a kick to it...a spicy-ness kick.  Sweet Potato Fries: Vanilla powerdered sugar and honey jalapeno mayo. Ok, powdered sugar on SWEET potato fries? Ok too much sweetness going on here.  Truffle Parmesan Fries: Hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt and truffle aioli. OMG. Just truffles left and right.   Just fries: the safest type of fries you can get.  The restaurant is fairly small. OR I thought so. Again, expect for a long wait on your food and long wait in line...unless you're the God/Goddess of Total Rewards points and they will just let you bypass the line."}
{"text":"When I go on vacation, I am huge on trying restaurants that are not within driving distance from my hometown. We came to this restaurant located in Planet Hollywood after discovering that the PH restaurant was not in the hotel, but in Ceasar's Palace... who would've thought!   We were seated within 30 minutes, which flew by as they let you leave and will text you when your table is ready.   Our waiter was attentive in the beginning, giving us his recommendations on what to try and his favorites. But after that, he was M.I.A. I was sadly unable to order a burger, as they do not have sesame seed free buns, and I have a tree nut allergy. This was a major let down, and I had to settle for the wings, which were good, but I really wanted a burger.   The food took about 30 mins to come out, which we were told about ahead of time. They brought out the wrong burger for my dad, but quickly brought out a new one and even comped it off the bill! That was great of them, very unexpected.   All in all, it was a great place, but if I were to return to Vegas, I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Being an avid burger lover who is always in search of the ultimate burger, Gordon Ramsey's BurGR has been on my bookmark for the longest time.  We were excited that we were eventually there!  This place must be popular.  At around 2:30PM on a Sunday afternoon during the slower season of October, we were still quoted a 20 - 30 minute wait.  We were seated in about 30 minutes, although I really think that they were a bit slow in clearing tables and seating customers.  Not a big deal but I would rather that they give us pagers instead of making us stand in line, so we can at least hang out in the casino.  But then standing in line would probably have saved me some money.  I absolutely love the Farm Burger - topped with sharp cheddar, duck breast bacon and a fried egg.  The duck breast bacon is not for everyone as it's really not like the regular crispy kind of bacon.  It's made with lean meat (no fat, NICE!) and has a slightly chewy texture - probably more like ham than bacon.  It's flavorful but I love that it's not overly salty.  It complements the burger perfectly.  Add a fried eggs with the yoke oozing, and it's close to burger heaven.  The American burger was topped with a generous portion of lettuce and thick slices of tomatoes.  The veggies were really fresh.  The best part was the pickles which were absolutely dee-lish and tasted like they were homemade.  The patty was cooked perfectly medium well just as ordered.  The fries were sprinkled with coarse sea salt which made them really tasty.  They came with the famous house chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup which were delicious.  The fries were served very hot and fresh from the fryer.  Awesome!  Service has been good and our server Jared has been really cool and helpful.  He patiently explained the menu to us as it was our first time there.  He checked back with us several times during our meal and our drinks were promptly refilled.    Probably not the ultimate burger experience, but it's pretty close.  Although I must admit that I have yet to find the ultimate burger, so this is probably as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Was not even served with napkins (may be the busy long weekend). Food was good but over priced.  Its a good place only if u wanna waste your 1-2hrs for just a burger. Gordon Ramsay needs to send some undercover camera persons to find the crack in his own plates. Customers will expect quality service as being portrayed in his television shows. Over all its not too bad, not too good."}
{"text":"Burgers were actually excellent. In hindsight I should have got the Farmer's, the one with the fried egg. Looked extra delicious.   Milkshakes were also terrific as well. Pudding on the top, nice tough. They are tall, but thin, so not as filling as they appear.   Fries were a disappointment however, neither of us finished them. Not awful, just not great. Or even good actually.  We arrived right at 12:30pm, in the middle of lunch. The wait line was 20-45 minutes long. By the time we finished eating around 2pm, there was no line at all, so skip the rush hour and get right in."}
{"text":"Their Farm Burger was outstanding, and filling. We enjoyed the atmosphere. My only complaint is that the hostess staff seemed a bit confused, they were all early-twenties and obviously hired for their looks. But all-in-all it was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"A good meal with a tourist friendly waiter who gave us a brief history of the place.   While I had a good overall experience, I learned that I should just get what I want and screw the \"get something different so there's more variety to taste\". My Chanterelle burger was good but not great. The Britannia burger with the mango chutney jam is great. The Kobe burger was the best of our meal. Their thick steak fries are amazing (and I prefer thinner ones) and come with tasty different ketchups, including a chipotle and a curry choice. They were served perfectly crunchy and warm and you get a lot in that cute cone presentation.   The wall of fire is cool and mesmerizing. We got there right when it opened for an early lunch to avoid lines we read about.  The service is a little slow, prices are ok for Vegas dining. Enjoy $1 off everything except drinks with a Planet Hollywood club discount membership.    There may be better burgers than others but you'll wanna try at least one shake. The Brûlée cookies n creme shake amazing. One flavor on top of another and I think I tasted blobs of brulee in the cookies portion. The shake is also surprisingly light.   The menu and drink coaster you can keep as a souvenir. I love freebies! :o)  I wish there were one in LA. We need a BurGR in LA, Chef Ramsey! We get sick of kale salads!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing, however the low review is due to the terrible hostesses (multiple bad ones). First of all, my partner, a concierge, called to make a reservation for a party of 6. He was told they don't take reservations but you can come in person and put your name on a list for a certain timeframe. He walked over there and they said they can't take the reservation till everyone's there, which wouldn't be for another 4 hours. When he told them about the hostess giving out wrong information as a courtesy to them, they were rude and disrespectful. Now when we got there, we waited for our table for almost 2 hours. Even after are name was called (or texted) the rude hostess yelled at us to stand in a very specific area because apparently she was overwhelmed with her side conversations. So we waited another 10 minutes after our name was called and got to listen to the hostesses complain about customers aka the people who fill there paychecks. IF YOU ARE IN A CUSTOMER SERVICE INDUSTRY, YOU SHOULDNT COMPLAIN ABOUT  CUSTOMERS BECAUSE YOU WOULDNT HAVE A JOB WITHOUT THEM, just saying! But the waiter we had was very kind and tried to be helpful while reciting a 2 minute long introduction that he clearly spent a lot of time memorizing. Both the appetizers and the entrees were absolutely amazing. I would recommend this restaurant if you simply just want a delicious meal and nothing more. Not a great dining experience, date, birthday, or any special event, just some really good food."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough.  It's annoying that the wait can be long and I really don't like the seating options they have - but the food is so amazing.  The gooey fries were amazing.  Next time we go we're going to split a burger.  The fries and onion rings are so good, the burger becomes secondary among it all."}
{"text":"Despite waiting for over 20 mins. The food was delicious!! I am a hugr fan of gordon ramsay, and it now i finally know how awesome his food is! I wanted to try the gordon ramsay steak house but it was on the higher end side. So i guess ill wait until next time!!  We ordered the farm burger and chicken burger with truffled fries.  The burgers were amazeballsss. It was the juiciest burgers i have ever eaten. The truffled fries are to die for!! The cream dip it comes with is bombbb!  A photographer took a few pictures of us.. But we never found out where or how we could obtain them?? Wouldve liked to know what happened to them.  Anyway, love this place!! Not too fancy but it definitely hits the spot!"}
{"text":"We are there two nights ago on the strip, it was amazing! Probably the best burger I've eaten, the onion rings were incredible as well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the hostess staff was appeared annoyed and rude, we waited 7 minutes to even be greeted at the table by a waiter...it HaD to be a fluke because the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was very good, atmosphere is very cool. Stopped for dinner at about 6:15 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately. Beer selection is decent but not spectacular, I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was cooked perfectly and couldn't really have been better. Pricing is on the higher end for what it is but not outrageous. Would definitely recommend stopping here!"}
{"text":"I finally had the pleasure of dining at a Gordon Ramsay establishment! I've spent years watching him scream at poor contestants on Hell's Kitchen while inspiring home cooks on Master Chef and last but not least helping failing restaurants come out of the ashes on Kitchen Nightmares.   Quick Tip: party greater than 3 or more skip the line and speak with the hostess. They will put you down and send you a text when your table is ready. Sorry, if you are a table of two you have to wait in line  I opted to try the Hog Burger since its one of their signature dishes. I was pleasantly surprised at how moist and tender the pork was bite after bite. It was cooked to medium perfection (recommended) and seasoned just enough to not steal the lime light from the porky goodness.  Fries were decent but nothing to write home about. We also got an order of wings for the table to share. Wings were fall off the bone and flavorful but for the price and size it felt a little steep.   Overall Thoughts  Gordon Ramsay, 1 for 1!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic place this is!!! I'm not just saying this as a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay, but I'm saying this as a burger monster!! My husband and I woke up after a late night in vegas, just to go stand in line to get a taste of Burgr and it was worth all of it!!! We started off with the roasted jalapeno poppers, which were served in individual little shot glasses with the sauce at the bottom. They were delicious. Definitely one of the best I've tasted. My husband ordered a cocktail, while I decided to go with the Shakes - Shake #1 which was a chocolate shake with caramel pudding (yes pudding!)... We ordered the uber cheese burger and the southern yardbird burger with a side of truffle parmesan fries. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The staff was friendly, efficient and helpful. All in all a five star experience and I will definitely go back there!"}
{"text":"Been several times.  Each time gets better.  Blows away Holsteins and even Bacchi burger (which I go to frequently).  It seriously does not get any better.  Great beer selection.  Unbelievable bun.  Incredibly knowledgeable staff.  Some of my most memorable meals of the year.  And that is saying a lot!!!  Absolute perfection!  It even tops Todd English's.  I will never mock Gordon again.  He hires and trains the right people.    I still visit Todd English's and Bacchi several times per year.  Save your time and money if you were considering Holsteins."}
{"text":"This place was great!! Fun, energizing environment and the fries- OH WOW!!! The burgers have more complex and interesting flavors that gives it a hearty, yet light taste. Been to Vegas 2x and been to this place 2x :-)"}
{"text":"Burgers look great but been here 22 min and still waiting for fries and the place is dead with a ton of staff. Hope the burgers are worth it.... They were. The burgers were amazing and so were the fries. 3 stars because the wait was horrible."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch, chicken, coated in corn flakes, sliders, an appetizer, you get two.  They were great, buns good...sweet potato fries, fresh, delicious, jalenpeno honey mayonnaise, too sweet, and NO spice; replaced with siracha mayo, much better...BUT, not worth the 25 minute wait  after being seated and ordering...Gordon Ramsey needs to take notice of the poor service related to waiting time, drank three glasses of water, waiting and waiting."}
{"text":"Ive always wanted to try this place ! I had the truffle fries and the onion rings ! They were both unique and tasted really really good. As far as the burger I got (farm burger) it was good but its not something that will make me come back xD"}
{"text":"farm burger amazing got coffee shake...heaven in a glass, there was a mix up with our appetizer didn't come til after the  burgers,  manager was right at our table comped the apps! Amazing! Really value their customers! Will come again for sure, my husband got the Chicken Burger, hands down best Chicken sandwich of his life!"}
{"text":"I am a firm believer of food first and service second. The ingredients are fresh and items are made from scratch, the combination of flavors is outstanding. The meat used is very good (good ratio of fat to meat), recommend lower temp cooking (med-rare to medium), in order to enjoy the real flavor. Now, service, needs some attention from management. It is a burger joint, I understand that, but when you eat at a Ramsey's restaurant, even if they are serving a peanut butter sandwich, the expectation for good-ramsey trademark service, should be the norm.  1. Told the server it is my wifes bday, not even a \"happy bday\", dessert, or any type of acknowledgement.  2. Sodas are empty, server asks \"what is that\", not even pointing at the soda. I asked what are you referring to, he said \"the drink\". How about, would you like a refill on your drink, what are you having today? 3. 40-45 minutes into the seating, no mention from server about the food delay (its a burger, everybody ordered med rare-medium, it should not take that long). I had to ask her to verify the order. 4. Kids under 5 years in the table, drinks served on heavy tall glass. No question about a high chair or booster chair for the 2 year old.   Little things- details that makes people remember and come back.. I would definitely order to go next time, but sorry, service did not cut it for me. Her interaction with us, was the same you would get at a burger king or Mcdonalds."}
{"text":"While the food was as good as a chef-inspired restaurant should be it was grossly overshadowed by the extremely poor service.  Ginger took care of us, and I wouldn't wish her on anyone else.  In my experience, waitstaff that have to write down the simple order of a two-top should be looking for a new career.  I'd echo the previous comments on how good the poppers, hummus, burgers, and especially the truffle fries are, but after more than two hours, and a 20 minute wait for desserts we were more than turned off.  Great food,  soon to be doomed by incompetent front of the house service from the 25 minute wait for a table in a half empty restaurant, to a waitress asking everyone around her for help as she drowned, to a floor manager that didn't seem to care..."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been wanting to try this since we moved to Vegas last month, finally went last night. The wait for 2 was about 20 mins, on a Friday night at about 10 pm. Not a bad wait time in my opinion. Our waitress, didn't get her name sadly was AMAZING. She greeted us almost right away and showed us the drinks and made some suggestions. We ordered 2 drinks, some signiture beer she suggested and a Whiskey Cherry Lemonade. They were both amazing drinks. We ordered the Onion Rings as an app, let me tel you, they are by far the BEST onion rings I have ever had. Amazing!! For dinner we both ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and shared the truffle fries, since she suggested we share since the portions are big. I'm glad we shared we barely finished. The fries were really good and so was the burger. Everything was amazing but the onion rings really stood out to me. I can't wait to take guests here when we have visitors."}
{"text":"Their fish sandwich was just out of the world. Fries werent great but one should truly try their fish sandwich."}
{"text":"Hungry and winning in Las Vegas, I knew I had to find food. After seeing a fellow yelper's review about this place (Hi Jacqueline R), I knew I had to try it out but I didn't expect to be in love!!! Located inside Planet Hollywood, we walked in to find a long line standing next to the restaurants name in flames of fire! Exciting!!! We waited a few minutes before being seated. The place has a nice feel to it without being too overwhelming. It's very modern and spacious. It gets even more modern once you get to place your order, which is placed thanks to an Ipad.. yes you read that right, on an Ipad!! So cool.   Our waiter came over and gave us a brief rundown on highlighted menu items. While scrolling through the menu we decided we would share our meal.  We ordered: *Truffle Parmesan Fries $11- HIGHLY recommended! Crisp, tasty, not oily at all. The truffle salt and parmesan, the amazing taste of these fries truly blew me away.  Outstanding! Some of the best fries ever! And for sure hard to share since I totally wanted to eat the whole thing myself. I love that the cheese was evenly spread out through out the whole cone of fries, which allowed us to get our fair share of cheese with each bite. The dipping sauce/truffle aioli was also pretty tasty.   (10/10)  *Euro Burger $16- Juicy meat, warm soft delicious bread bun, truffle aioli running down my fingers making me lick the goodness off, some goat cheese, roasted tomatoes and arugula for some greens. Goodness gracious! The quality of this burger is so worth the dollars I spent to get to this burger bliss. The burger was a decent size, I would have been wayyyy full if I ate it all myself but we were pretty satisfied with the portion and decided to leave some room in for more alcohol.  (10/10)  *Green tea gin- STRONG flavor of gin in this drink indeed! Had a good buzz going on thanks to this baby. The green tea flavor wasn't as strong as I thought it would be.   (9/10)  We were gonna try a shake or the interesting push pops that we saw some people sharing from across our table but they said it wasn't anything too special or highly recommended so we decided to skip out on dessert.   There is a professional photographer that comes around and takes pictures of you during your meal which made me feel like a celebrity haha. We decided to not purchase the picture. I thought it was interesting that they offered this service but the photographer himself was very nice and easy going. The customer service of Burgr is truly up to standards. They know how to treat their customers well. They for sure make them feel special and walk out with a happy belly and pretty smile. Would love to come back and get me another burger (maybe the hell's kitchen burger with the jalapeno for the spice and some avocado slices or brittania burger that sounded interesting with mango chutney and sharp cheddar cheese) and my own side of fries to make any Vegas vacation trip an incredible one in my book. Everything I tried here was well worth the price!"}
{"text":"Hit this place at night. Matter of fact, I was the last customer that they let in. I am a burger fan and I was with my wife and another couple. We all wanted to come and taste a good burger. Well, I was a bit disappointed. The yhave a great selection. I ordered mine with cheeses and bacon. simple medium cooked. I did take on the garlic fries. I will tell you that the burger was a good size, the bun was a great one, however I was not impressed with the flavor of the meat. Nothing to call home about at 12 dollars just for the burger. Now the fries were amazing, and what you for them matches the goodness.   Everyone came out there saying ehhh, it was ok. They got nothing on Burgerfi or burgers & Beer joint.  Sad to say, but I will have to pass on this one..."}
{"text":"One if by land, two if by sea.  Sunday, January 27th, 2013 was the day of the British Invasion, the day Gordon Ramsay would take Vegas by storm.  I decided this would be the ideal day to give BurGR another chance.  Let me tell you, the British must have come by sea, because two was the magic number.  The following is the review of BurGR that should have been penned the first time.  Carved between separate halls of bustling casino exists a whimsically designed yet decidedly masculine cafe.  The eatery is home to the applewood grill and culinary delights of celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, a fact that cannot be forgotten due to the grand scale of pictorial homage.  Seated in the restaurant one cannot help but be reminded of a subtle cross between Hell's Kitchen and The F-Word.  The drink menu comes via Ramsay's staple iPad, there is a wide array of potables from the tabs of the tablet.  But since in Ramsay's restaurant, I decided to sample his favorite brew, Innis and Gunn a Scottish style ale aged in re-coopered barrels from alternating rum/whiskey sources.  The taste is sublime and soon our starter plate of hummus arrives to accompany the beer.  Ramsay's salt and pepper hummus is a little more garlic and salt than pepper but the bread is warm and fresh and the vegetable offerings conduct the hummus into a symphony for the palate.  Next up, the Hell's Kitchen and Uber Cheese burgers arrive at the table.  The medium-rare temperature is a little more like medium but the patties have not lost their flavor.  The grilled jalapeno, avocado, and tomato team up on the Hell's Kitchen and complete their dinner service in style.  The Uber Cheese has three different types and styles of cheese together, from fontina to goat the cheese is undoubtedly the star of this burger.  Lost or overpowered are any subtlety in the cooking process, all that is left is a delicious sandwich fit for anyone braving the treacherous days and nights of Las Vegas.  The \"Just Fries\" are as billed, they come accompanied with Chipotle ketchup and Curry ketchup that are both made in house.    The dessert menu is simple as is most of the menu really.  You can have your choice of flavor of pudding milkshake, or sticky toffee pudding push-pops which arrived at our table only moments after the burgers had been cleared.  The push-pop is a novel and flavorful package for sticky toffee pudding.  The salted peanut ice cream is devine and is a perfect mate for the sweet toffee pudding layers.  The most impressive piece of BurGR is not the decor, the location or even the food or drinks.  Ramsay has nailed the service experience at BurGR.  The servers are eager and knowledgeable.  They are impeccably dressed in GR labelled gear.  The hostess stand is state of the art with iPads and text message table notification.  The manager stopped by our table and was friendly and gracious.  This level of quality experience may be what sets this \"burger joint\" apart from all other \"burger joints\" in Vegas.  Well Done"}
{"text":"If this isn't my favorite burger place in the world, it's dang close.   I look forward to the day when I go through the double blind burger study (that exists, right?) to find out via some pseudo- scientific burger method.  OK... so here is how this goes down.   Last year I dropped in (by dropping in, I mean waiting in line because there is ALWAYS a line) to give it a try.   Everyone said it was great, so I would just power through waiting in line to check it off the list.   HOLY COW!   My taste buds exploded with burger nirvana.   Specifically, I had the Britannia burger, some sweet potato fries and a shake.   I have already forgotten the shake (except that it had pudding in it... yeah... not a fan... but the shake was an 'accessory' as far as I'm concerned) and the fries were really really good, but the burger... oh... my sweet and wonderful burger.   How I love thee so.   If I weren't so full, I would have ordered a second one.  The next day (last year still), I decide that it was so good, I HAD to go back.   Let's find out if the night before was a fluke, or if it was really as good as I remembered.   IT WAS!   IT was GLORIOUS!   I was about to mix it up and try a different burger, but the heck with it... when something rocks... stick with it.   Britannia burger... same 11 on a scale of 10.    Fast forward to 2016... I'm back to see if they can keep the quality up 12 months later.   I wait in line (btw... if you haven't realized, it's worth the wait), and BLAMMO!   Oh heck yeah...It's happy tummy time (that's G-rated for you kids out there).   I couldn't have been happier.  Add to it that the onion rings were top flight as well, and we have what may be close to a perfect meal.  Now what was especially great is that the waitstaff is superb.   Funny, fun, attentive, good at answering questions and giving honest feedback.   I really appreciate how hard it is to be a server/ bar tender, and these guys made it look easy.   If anyone at BurGR is actually reading this... just chat with your hostesses.   I know they are slammed with people waiting in line that are drunk/ short tempered/ etc... just remind them to smile smile smile.   They are setting the tone for those folks deciding if it's worth it.   They get a C+/B-, but since everything else is an A+++, that's the only thing I found that I was grinding my teeth about.  If you love your burgers, you need to just jump in line and go here."}
{"text":"Can't vouch for the food, since I haven't tried it. Was lured in by the pudding shakes, tried the coffee one with hazelnut pudding and it was really great. The only way it could have been better was if it had a spoon as well (ordered it to go). The pudding is impossible get through the straw."}
{"text":"I had the duck bacon burgr and it was the best I've ever had anywhere in the USA.  The burgr are fantastic."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of burger places and the burger here was really good, not one complaint of the flavor of the meat.  However the regular fries needed to be double cooked to get then really crispy, they were too soggy for me.    My biggest complaint is the size of the burger, way too small for my liking and the price."}
{"text":"Had a 30 minute wait to get in but the time went by quickly as there is a lot to see and do around the restaurant.  I had the Uber Cheeseburger and truffle fries.  My friends had the Hells Kitchen but said it was not hot or spicy.  Burgers are over priced but they have good flavor and great buns!!  The truffle fries are worth every penny and the best I've ever had.  Ended up paying $30 for burger, fries, and an iced tea."}
{"text":"Ok, Be prepared to spend big money on a burger, averaging at $15/burger sides not included...but also be prepared for one of the best burgers you've ever had!  I went with a friend who is a beer and burger fanatic so we were both pumped as two Gordon Ramsay fan club northerners raised on meat and potatoes can get.  We decided to start off with the jalapeño poppers and not the \"just fries but the delux truffle/parmesan fries (cause hey, you're at a GORDON RAMSAY restaurant. this is no time to hold back)    The Fries were incredible, truffle flavor saturating each bite, the delightful fluffy parmesan, two dips, a creamy dip and a spicy ketchup dip,  the cooked to perfection crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside, salted to perfection melt in your mouth experience that has me drooling on the keyboard as I type.  Then there were the poppers.  6 massive poppers, that are more like the size of chicken fingers arrive each in their own dipping sauce contained shot glass all in a row. The presentation is beautiful and exciting, because one of these delicious bad boys is extra spicy! its like a russian roulette where everybody wins!  I love that you don't have to be hung up on double dipping protocol either. there is plenty of individually portioned dip per poppper.   Appetizers perfect. on to main course.   We each ordered a burger and shared because it was so hard to pick! Cheeses I'd never even heard of! exotic ingredients, each one had me salivating with each syllable.   My friend ordered the Char Siu Burger cooked medium. This burger had Pork Belly, Honey-Hoisin Sauce, radish, cilantro and cucumber.  This was the one I wanted to pick, so hastily I chose the Euro Burger which had Truffle Aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomato.  I bit into my burger first and for 10 minutes it was the best burger I'd ever had... then I bit into the char-siu. I swear I had one of those ratatouille moments, except there were no childhood memories to rush back to... I simply was taken somewhere, a  journey that started in my mouth and went straight into my soul. The balance of flavors, textures, aromas, everything was a symphony that frankly got me a little choked up. There was mist in my eyes folks.   For desert we ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push up pops. It was between that or a milkshake.  Wish Id gone with a milkshake. The pops were ok, it was very fun and a cool idea but i just wasn't blown away. it paled in comparison to the appetizers and main course.     If I were to have a suggestion for Gordon Ramsays Restaurant, it would be maybe to expand the deserts a little bit. Sticking with your diner fare, maybe offer your twist on a classic american pie a la mode?  a cobbler or maybe something english?   Otherwise I had an amazing time and I can't wait to go back and try another burger off the menu.  I've got my eye on the Britannia, the Artisinal and the Farm.   This restaurant is going to be my undoing."}
{"text":"Zipped in for their awesome sweet potato fries (best ever?) cooked to perfection & the #4 shake! Great afternoon snack. Chilled out at the back bar. Good service. I like the burgers at Guy F's better."}
{"text":"I was so glad that my cousins and I got to try out this new burger or should I say burGR joint in Vegas!  I came with a party of 6 and at first, we were dismayed by the LARGE line coming out of the front (still have no idea what that line was for) because we walked to the front and instead of waiting in that line, the hostess took down my number and said they would text in ~a hour when our table was ready. We walked around the shops and not even 30 minutes later, received a text that our table was ready. I appreciate a restaurant that does not tell you the wait will be 10 when it's actually 30, so for the wait to be LESS then what they told us....brownie points to BurGR!  Items Ordered: - Roasted Jalapeno Poppers - Sweet Potato Fries - Truffle Parmesan Fries - Shake #4  - Hell's Kitchen Burger - Farm Burger - Euro Burger  I love a place that cooks a burger the way you want it and you could tell the meat was quality meat - juicy!!! I personally loved the farm burger for it's ooey gooey egg!  Everyone loved the food, the staff/service (did I mention that the servers leave a iPad that you can browse their whole drink menu on?).  I would rather pay to eat Gordon Ramsay's BurGR than Umami any day!  :)"}
{"text":"I was going to give BURGR a 4 because it didn't taste bad (but not great) when I had it.  It wasn't until about 45 minutes later until I decided this place was no good.  I felt like I ate a pound of salt, my clothes stunk like onions and had no desire to eat dinner.   The more I started thinking about it, the more cheesy the place became.  The service was over the top.  The waiters were not real people but actors,  the wings were so-so and when comparing it to an In-N-Out burger for 3x the price, then I feel ok giving it a 1 star."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriends and absolutely loved it from start to finish.    We each ordered an appetizer to share including the jalapeño poppers, onion rings and truffle fries.   The jalapeño poppers were DELISH, but had a serious bite to them at the end.  I love spicey so I was down with that.   Super delicious cheesy goodness interior with a slight hint of bacon.  The onion rings were great but not my favorite.   The Truffle fries were the BOMB.  I love anything truffle and is did not disappoint.  I asked the server what the most popular burger was and she didn't hesitate in recommending the Euro Burger. I ordered mine with the Portabella Mushroom instead of meat.  It was so good.  I can't wait to go back.   My friend also had the Euro burger and said it was one of the best burgers ever.   And she is a major foodie so I know it must have been great.  Attention to detail was evident in this restaurant from the menu to the food.  I'm even considering staying at Planet Hollywood just to be in close proximity to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food was absolutely wonderful. Would have earned a perfect rating if not for the a few little set backs.   Ok I get it, I went Saturday night it was busy. However that is not an excuse to be rude. We all have long days at work etc etc. When the nice little host was approached to ask a question not only does she rudely reply \"get in line\" with a why are you bothering me attitude, but also there is a sign saying see host before standing in line... Also she did not make eye contact when talking to me. Both of the hosts sat there and talked to each other no \"sorry for the wait\" \"you will be seated shortly\" nothing!   Next they literally fit as many tables into the smallest space ever. I felt like I was packed in like a sardine the party next to us was elbow length away, granted I did go on a busy night but still.   Besides that the food was spectacular my burger was great. Overall good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Went about 3 today before the dinner rush. Great burger my husband got the Ramsey he said ok but my Hells Kitchen was yummy and they use steak fries. If only two or one person ask to sit at the bar in the kitchen. We even lucked in and Christina Season 10 winner was there and even brought our burgers over. Cannot wait to come back just for dessert"}
{"text":"The burger was like any other \"craft\" burger that you can find anywhere else these days. However, the onion rings were particularly tasty. I would go back just for the onion rings..."}
{"text":"While staying at the MGM, wanted a \"simple\" burger joint for dinner.  Vegas is the hardest place to choose where to dine given the thousands of options, from dive-bar to four-michelin star restaurants.    Located in Planet Hollywood, Gordon Ramsay BurGR, is one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants (I think he has at least 3-4 in Vegas).  It has a sleek, modern design with 30-foot long fire walls.  It was a Saturday night (we went early before shows) so even though we went at 6:00 p.m., we knew there would be a wait.  They have the buzzers, which allow you to roam around the casino.  After a 40-minute wait, we got a booth and were promptly greeted by our server.  Each of us ordered a different burger.  I had the Chanterelle Burger, medium-rare, cooked over an open flame with arugula, and a figgy-onion jam.  Was really good and at $16 for Vegas, I thought the price was really reasonable.    Fried are not included and we ordered a regular hand cut fries and a order of truffle parmesan fries.  Fries are definitely done in the pomme frites, twice fried method.    Service was good; however, there was confusion on our order because our servers switched halfway through the service.  For example, we were offered another fries after we had ours (we refused because we were stuffed).  Our total meal with beers was $120.   Although can't fault the burger, will probably try another burger place next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Presentation meets taste expectation  Must have the furry wings and blue burger. Everything here is delicious. Will come again"}
{"text":"2.75 stars... but i'll round up.  over hyped.  super long wait... serviced sucked.  maybe our waitress had a bad day... but she wasn't friendly at all.  Food took forever to come out.    I tried 2 of the burgers.  the one with duck bacon and the spicy one.  Both were kinda dry.  They needed more flavor or something.  Felt like my hamburger may have sat around for a while.  it wasn't hot... like it just came off the grill.  Sweet potato fries were good.  The truffle fries... didn't really have enough truffle taste.   chocolate shake was good.  pass on the asian porky belly buns.  Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"No wonder the wait is so long, the burgers took 45 minutes to come to my table. It's meat with two pieces of bread. Not the cure for cancer. If I wasn't drunk I would of ripped my face off and eaten that. And what does a guy have to do for some regular ketchup. Don't mess with the classics."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, I didn't enjoy the burger or fries here. Fries were too soggy and oily I knew something went wrong when making it. Burger was more rare than I am used to. While it was huge and filling, I felt that it lacked taste and needed better seasoning."}
{"text":"I don't see what all the fuss is about when it comes to this place. I got the fish sandwich and after eating it I felt really gross. It was way too heavy on the stomach with salt, deep fry, and butter. I felt like I needed throw up. The fries were also pretty dry. However, the atmosphere was great and our waitress was really nice. Some girl with glasses and a little gap in her teeth. A real sweetheart. I just don't think I'd ever come back here."}
{"text":"Second time here, horribly rude service both times. Dang I want to love this place because I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan big time. I ordered fish and chips and after i ordered it and ask if they had malt vinegar and I was told they were out. Our waitress could have cared less. She continued to be rude. The food was greasy and just not what my husband and I thought a Gordon Ramsay place would serve. Just super bummed. Ashley our waitress really needs to get out of the service business."}
{"text":"My son is a big fan of Gordon Ramsay! When we took a trip to Vegas I knew he would love to visit one of his restaurants so I decided to surprise him.  We had some younger teens in our group as well so I decided Burger would be the best location.  Not only was it a great surprise but the food was great as well!  We all loved it! I am not typically a fan of burgers but these were delicious and the fries were good too.  Very nice, clean, and modern. It really has a nice flare to it. The kids loved it! The staff was great and very friendly. Gordon would be so proud.  There was a little bit of a wait but nothing too bad and in fact, it went much faster than the estimated time they gave us, to begin with. Either way, it would be well worth the wait.  I was pretty impressed and very pleased that we were able to stop by. Definitely, recommend you check it out, and we will absolutely visit again!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Well worth the wait and we got lucky enough to be there in a night previous Hell's Kitchen winner Chef Christina was there. Is it a lil pricey at $15 for the burger-not in my opinion ir anyone else's that was with us. All 7 in the group agreed they would return in a heartbeat. My husband had the yardburger and I tried the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was spicy but not too spicy since the avocado helped balance it out. The truffle fries were also beyond delicious. Unfortunately we were too stuffed to try a shake or dessert but we will be back!"}
{"text":"As usual before any trip I take, I bookmark places I want to see and try on Yelp.   I Yelp, so of course I have a special love for food. As you can imagine, I was laying in bed a week before my trip, searching for the restaurants with the highest ratings and reviews. Gordon Ramsay burGR was one of the first restaurants to pop up in my search, and I'm always looking for new burger joints, so of course it was bookmarked!  PLANET HOLLYWOOD After checking into our hotel, the boyfriend and I decided to make our way on over to Planet Hollywood to check out burGR. When we got in front of the restaurant, there was a line of people waiting to be seated. Surprisingly the wait was not very long, because I initially predicated that we'd be waiting for at least 30 minutes. But we waited for about 15-20 minutes, which was not too bad!   INSIDE burGR There is a full bar, it's Vegas, of course there's a full bar! There are also TVs lining the walls, so you can watch your favorite sports game while you stuff your face with meaty goodness. The decor was very modern, the seats were very comfortable and you just felt very relaxed inside. It'll even make you forget how much money you lost at the craps table. Okay, so maybe it won't but you never know!   OH, HELLO MEATY DELICIOUSNESS  A lot of Yelpers mentioned the Farm Burger, so of course we had to order that. In addition, we ordered the Blue Burger (bleu cheese, hence the name blue burger) and their onion rings.  Out of the two burgers, the Farm Burger was the best. It had duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar cheese and a fried egg. ANY BURGER WITH A FRIED EGG IS GOING TO BE DELICIOUS, and this did not disappoint. The Blue Burger was good (maybe too heavy on the bleu cheese), but not as tasty as the Farm Burger. Oh, and the onion rings WERE SO GOOD! So, don't forget to add that into your order.  CONCLUSION The food was good, the atmosphere was very nice and the service was a two thumbs up. I wouldn't come running back to Gordon Ramsay burGR the next time I'm in town, but I'd definitely revisit sometime in the near future after trying other burger restaurants! :)   BTW, does anyone else notice how many restaurants this man has in Vegas?? Good job, Ramsay!! :)"}
{"text":"Located at the entry of Planet Hollywood, typically there's a long line.  As we entered, the line was super short this time, so we decided to finally try it out.  Our server, Hilary was very friendly and professional.  We ordered... Ahi sliders - fresh but bland Pork belly sliders - a little bland for us. Fish and Chips - very uncomfortable thick sandwich to eat.   Sweet potato fries - good Iced tea   Since Gordon Ramsay is so famous, I thought the food would have been better.  We had to ask for hot sauce and lemon to make things better.  Nothing had a punch.    With so many options in Vegas, this is not a place I'll be returning.  Disappointing...  3 stars are for the service."}
{"text":"Anytime I have friends come to las Vegas I bring them here to GR BurGR.  The burgers here are top notch, and I'd say I can't think of a better burger in Vegas.    The burgers are made from chopped up ribeye, so feel free to order the burger rare.  The truffle fries are superb as well, and one order is more than enough for 2 people.  The prices may seem a bit high, 13-18 for a burger, and 8-14 for apps and sides, but the quality and taste of the food definitely is in line with the prices.    There is a consistent line here, so be prepared for a little bit of a wait unless you're a Platinum or above member of Total Rewards.  In short, if you've never been here, you definitely have to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Chef Ramsay is straight to the point when it comes to naming his Vegas restaurants. He has a place called Steak, a place called Fish & Chips, and this place, BurGR. My friend and I were set to see a show at Planet Hollywood and wanted to stop here first to eat. There was no line at about 5:30, but when we back down an hour later, it had increased significantly so. We waited about 45 minutes to be seated, which was a bummer, but the food was good.   I opted for the turkey burger which had interesting ingredients, including a blueberry compote. For as busy as the restaurant was, I half-expected a dry burger or one that tasted \"rushed.\" However, my burger was juicy and flavorful, the fries we shared were hot and crispy. I really wanted to try one of their shake desserts, but was too full and we didn't have enough time.   Our service was pretty good and the overall vibe was casual and fun. I recommend this place, but like anywhere on The Strip, if you can try to go on an off time, you most likely won't be waiting as long."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Went here for my birthday on Friday night for a late night dinner. There was a long line of people waiting when we got there, but the hostess took our name and we were able to get a text message when our table was ready...so we found a bar and drank until it was! Awesome :)  We had the jalapeño poppers, regular and truffle fries, shake #5, and we each got a burger. I got the blue burger and added duck bacon, which was killer :) medium rare perfection. Everything was top notch. For 5 of us, it was $125. Reasonable for a delicious Vegas bday dinner! Would totally go back!"}
{"text":"While  out in Vegas for a birthday , I had a big craving for a nice juicy burger. I think Gordon Ramsay's BurGR Spot in Planet Hollywood hit on the money for me!   So we were expected to wait 80 minutes for a table of nine but enjoyed the text when ready concept. The time flew by as we relaxed at the bar next to the restaurant. We were  sat down by a very passionate server. He took his time explaining the details on almost every burger. I Yelped before, obviously, and saw the support for the Hell's Kitchen Burger. I went with that and we shared the truffle fries, onion rings, and wings.  Appetizers: Amazing I am not big truffle fries kind of guy, I personally think its a gimmick to charge more, but i really tasted the big flavor out of the appetizer menu item. The wings had a little heat on them and this amazing char & just overall taste with the blue cheese counter balancing everything. The onion rings were cooked perfectly, batter spot on, and I had to order another serving to enjoy more!  Burger: so they sell this burger as the best burger in Vegas. I think it is up there! It's one of the better burger I have ever had & I love to eat this  American Classic. They sell this burger as spicy which is a joke lol. It could be my middle eastern background of handling heat, but no spice raised my awareness. What the burger had, was a pepper that was charred and then skinned. I thought the use of the pepper and the cooling factor of the huge portion of avocado worked perfectly. The burger was cooked exactly how I wanted and I truly enjoyed it! The burger is about medium sized portion. I was feeling good after, and very satisfied.  Overall, hands up for this place! This Burger Restaurant was amazing. The combination of great service, fun environment, and great food that is unique leads me to say that's BurGR deserves 5 STARS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers! Even greater service! I have to mention our waitress Britney. Made good recommendations and was very patient with us. She was polite, sincere and knowledgeable. I am a Gordon Ramsay fan from TV and I tried the innocence gone beer, as Britney said it was Ramsay's favorite beer there, it was very good.  All I can say about BURGR; The best burger I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Oh Gordon hit a winner with this one and in Las Vegas no less? To keep it themed I only yell JACKPOT!  This by far is holding the best burger establishment in Vegas at this point. I was disappointed with burger bar in my previous reviews as the quality of the food doesn't stack up, Holsteins which is average except no wow factor. BurGR will blow your mind away!  I started with the jalapeno poppers and I did think coming shot glass style in dipping sauce was true Vegas style yet creative none the less. They were light tasting breading wise and it was filled with cheese and bacon. C'mon, need I say more about that combo?  Main course consisted of the parmesan fries which held heat very well through the whole meal. I think there is a secret hidden in the paper wrapping it was delivered in, but 5 stars all the way for these and well portioned as well (definitely sharing quantity). I partnered that with the farmer burger which ordered medium rare MELTED in my mouth (THANK YOU FOR COOKING A BURGER PROPER) and the egg/cheese just worked so well in unison it made me tear up. My wife giggled at the noises I was making which hey I was in heaven with that plate of mine.   Next time I will try to leave room for dessert as if the above was any indication of what to come I'll risk losing my socks for some dessert as well. *SIGH* Can't wait to be back ordering here again!!"}
{"text":"The waiter suggested the Farm burger, Euro burger or Hell's kitchen burger. I got the Farm Burger ($15), which came with duck bacon and a fried egg. The burger tasted a little dry. It needed some sauce like BBQ or something for the bacon.   The shakes were amazing! Try shake # 4! It's an oreo shake with a creme brulee pudding. I didn't know a shake could taste so good :).  I also got the \"just fries\" which came with curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup. My whole table thought the chipotle ketchup tasted really weird... it tasted sour which was super strange. However, the curry ketchup was to die for. It tasted just like curry... definitely would come back just for this curry sauce again haha."}
{"text":"What a great dining experience.  The service was white table cloth attentive.  The burgers were great.  Onion rings great  Hummus fantastic  French fries, plain and Sweet potato great.  There is a line, be patient it is worth the wait.  The ambiance is cool and hip.  Again the service outstanding.  We had 4 folks, 4 ice teas so no adult beverage $120 before tip. For me well worth it"}
{"text":"The best burger I have tasted!! Hells Kitchen Burger is a must try!! Staff was great too! Our waitress was so informative of the menu. It's inside Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Just in Vegas for the week and wanted to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  Saw that he had a burger place so we tried GR BurGR.  The restaurant does not take reservations so we waited about 45mins to get in which wasn't bad.  Being seated and getting our orders in was fairly quick but it was about 45mins before we got our food.  It was quite busy as I'm sure as it always is so that wait was justified.  I had the Hells Kitchen burger with truffle fries!  They were both great.  My wife had the fish and chips sandwich which was good!  There was very little that batter on the fish which may it light!  All and all a good meal I would compare it to Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay!!"}
{"text":"Yes! Go Gordon Ramsay! BurGR makes my top 5 best burgers I've ever had, hands down.  As is with everything in Vegas, BurGR is unique and a little over-the-top. Just look at the flaming window display!! That it's a GR restaurant also helps!  Something to note is the seating system. If your party is more than 2, you will have to put your name down and be texted when a spot opens up. Parties of 2 stand in line. My party of 3 waited for about 45-50 minutes for a table. Whatever, the PH casino is entertaining enough.  Food is fantastic! The burgers come a la carte, so be sure to order sides of fries or onion rings if you wish. The sides are rather large, so I'd definitely recommend sharing.   I ordered the euro burger and truffle fries to share, and Boddington's beer. Burger is A+, soft artisan bun, patty cooked just right, and all the fixins make this burger fantastic! No complaints about the truffle fries either.   Definitely hit up BurGR for a burger done right!"}
{"text":"If you think this is five stars you haven't lived. I'm sorry but it needed to be said. Off the top of my head, Hamburger Mary's in Chicago and  Peter's Gourmade Grill in California blow the burgers here out of the water.  Oddly enough, the PORK burger was the star of the show.  I would never wait 2 hours for this again. At least I can cross it off the list if places to try."}
{"text":"Really on the 3/4 fence here.  Server, when she was to be found, was very enthusiastic and seemed genuinely excited about her job.  The problem was the execution of her role: asked three times for an ice water, waited 10-15 minutes for a beer, etc.  They were fairly busy and had only been opened three days, so maybe she was still getting acclimated, but I do get tired of making excuses for weak service, whatever the reason is.  The burger I had with bleu cheese was outstanding and the ($8) fries were very good as well.  But perhaps the biggest surprise was how tasty the naan, veggie and sea salt hummus was as an appetizer.  There were three people in our party and the tab, with tip, was $142 and included three alcoholic beverages.  Obscene-even by Strip standards-for a burger joint, but I guess I'd recommend it if you're in the area and don't want to cross the street for the equally good-and not quite as pricey-Holsteins."}
{"text":"I would start by saying after having Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill I was looking forward too trying Gordon Ramsay Burger. Thankfully my cousins visiting choose different Gordon Ramsay. I was not disappointed but neither did I get wowed or impressed with the food. If not for all the Gordon Ramsay name sake all over the restaurant strip it down without it. It clone of Bachi Burger even down too the way serves the fries. I had the Hell Kitchen Burger. Solid burger it cooked too perfect medium, nice moist and juicy inside. I enjoy the combination of the cheese,, roasted jalapeno, avocado, and over roasted tomato. It had that nice little heat from the jalapeno overall solid burger. I had the truffle fries that was good. I felt they could have mixed the seasoning especially the truffle oil or whatever they do better throughout the fries. I felt times that fries bottom had no truffle flavor. The dipping sauces was solid. Dessert try the sticky toffee pudding push up pops. My cousin and I split since it came two pop ups. I did LOVE the presentation of it. It literally looks like old school pop ups ice creams remember getting from ice cream truck on the street. But say in food presentation makes the first impression but if the food not stand up then all for not. I totally feel about it. Plus after the sticky toffee pudding NO WAY it could have competed with the one at Gordon Ramsay Pub and Grill. I felt the cake itself very bland nothing stood out with it. The ice cream between layers nothing special and overall dessert that waiter pushed hard felt let down.   The service was great! I love the energy we got from our waiter. He was very informative. They also have the Ipad touch screens for there drinks just like the Pub and Grill. I liked different approach with the menu on top of the napkins and just style. The menu is straight forward same as Bachi Burger just burgers, friends, apps, shakes, other non burgers, and desserts. Surprise considering its the STRIP property and big name but prices were reasonable. If remember correctly Bachi and here average burger is in $15 range. The hostess wonderful, friendly, and start you off great experience.   The one thing that aggravating is too find it. The signs NON of them in Planet Hollywood directs too it. Not that the layout of the casino helps one bit. It next too PF Changs or say around the corner.   Overall it was cool knowing that just went too Pub and Grill then Burger. Now all I need complete the tirfecta is Steak. If urge for gourmet burger sorry but Bachi Burger my go spot! If on the strip not bad alternative."}
{"text":"Burger was amazing, fries were ok. But seriously, burgers are to die for. :) it's open late, and we got seated very quickly. If you bring your free total rewards card you get discounts on the food items."}
{"text":"Un des très bons burgers que j'ai mangé. Les à côtés comme les frites peuvent très bien être partagés puisque les portions sont généreuses. Je m'attendais à plus cher étant donné la réputation de monsieur Ramsey et du fait que c'est Vegas, mais nous nous en sommes sorti pour 35$ chacun (2 burgers, 2 à côtés et 2 sodas). Nous avons en plus reçu un excellent service. À essayer!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love the place because of all the reviews but the food and service was subpar for the price.  We went on Sunday Afternoon around 3pm.  We had a short wait until we were seated.  My wife ordered just a plain burger with tomato, and I ordered the hog Burger, and we decided to get the onion rings.  The burgers and the onion rings arrived, and ight off the bat, we notice her burger has cheese on it. We send it back and get the correct burger pretty quickly, and we asked for some regular ketchup.  The waitress goes and brings back what was supposed to be regular ketchup but ended up being chipotle ketchup.  My wife doesn't have a tolerance for anything spicy and it really ruined her experience after the burger mess up and now being given the wrong ketchup.  We notified the waitress and the first thing she tells us is that all their ketchups are made in house.  Which is fine, but she stated they have a non spicy ketchup. She realized she had given us chipotle, and finally brought the right ketchup.    The hog burger was a sight to behold.  It had a lot of flavor but was a bit too salty for my taste.  The onion rings were tempura battered and tasted very oily and and the batter salty.  Overall, it was a cool experience to eat here, but we would definitely never go back again."}
{"text":"This place has for sure become my FAVORITE burger place here in Vegas!!! I love their burgers!! But I hate their wait!!! It gets really packed sometimes with a crazy line outside and they do NOT take reservations : ( Yet I will still go there and wait to have a burgers. I have liked the appetizers I had tried there like the onion ring tower,and  jalapeno poppers, BUT I do think the appetizers are really worth it for the price... but that could be me because I am not crazy about fried food groups.  Service and staff are excellent!!! AND THEIR SHAKES!!!"}
{"text":"Yum! My burger was DELISH! Cooked perfectly, the perfect amount of ingredients (not so big that it was impossible to bite) and AMAZING sweet potato fries topped with powdered sugar (don't knock it till you try it). Also, the jalapeno poppers are out of this world good!  So glad we got to try this place out in Vegas, it's definitely worth a visit.   My four star rating is because our waitress seemed less than thrilled to be serving us and was not the most accomdating when we asked for a recomendation. Also, I can't stand when you have to order fries on the side, especially when your burger alone is $15. But hey, it's Vegas..."}
{"text":"The burger was delicious, also the veggie one. I liked the fries, but one order is enough for two. The pretty a polite waitress. The manager was careful and even accepted to take us a picture. If you are a Gordon Ramsey fan, you must visit BurGR.  You will wait in line at least 30 min to get in, don't get desperate."}
{"text":"If the service was as good as my Euro Burger, i would have given this place 5 stars.  So here is the problem.  I went with some friends from the UK and they dont understand the whole Auto-grat thing.  My friend quickly swiped the bill before I could look at it and paid.  He questioned the auto-grat and the manager was kind enough to take it off.  (my friend wanted to tip as he saw fit)  We had a table of 8 Adults and 3 children. Here is the issue:  Did our server do that much to garner a $40 tip?  I don't think so.  She came over and greeted us, had other people bring us waters, took our order, had others deliver the food and we didnt really see them again until the service was over.   For that, I would have tipped a little closer to 10%.  If its a multi-course meal service where I am getting constant attention from our server team - OK, I feel like 20% is more reasonable.    The food was really good.  I had a Euro Burger with Parm Truffle Fries - and they were both cooked perfectly, and was really delicious.   Here's where it gets really bad:  Clearly our server has a gabbing problem.  She didn't like that my friend disputed the auto-grat and went back and told her co-workers in the back...   I then witnessed one of the other servers \"mean mug\" my friend as she walked past the table twice, roll her eyes and shake her head.  First of all, we arent even at your table, second of all, This is your service level?  I could only hope for Gordon himself to emerge from the back and send this girl packing... (he didn't)  - I approached the manager who was extremely apologetic, albeit dismissive that his employee actually had done this with purpose (she did.)   All told, I wont be back.  There are far too many options in Las Vegas to be bothered by terrible service.  This place is accompanied by an extended waiting period due to to its name.  Sorry, I cannot recommend you to go there.  (try shake shack, bachi burger or even in n out)"}
{"text":"Nice place. Very busy. Packed the 2 person tables in the room like sardines though. Could tell this place was designed for maximum capacity/profit. Could easily hear the couple's conversation beside you. Aisles were very narrow in table area.  Now for the food. Onion Ring appetizers were great. Dipping sauces marched perfectly. Plenty of drink choices. Entree burgers were absolutely DELICIOUS. I got the main burger, the Gordon Ramsey something or another. The fries, however, lacked in taste and the dipping sauces for them didn't go well. I pretty much left my entire order of fries untouched. My wife got the Sweet Potato fries and she said the same.   That said, we spent $105 for two people for burgers and fries. Yes, it's Vegas and yeah it's a hot TV personality chef. Just seemed like a little much."}
{"text":"I came here before Christmas in Dec 2012. I've never been disappointed at the food in Las Vegas. I had the avocado burger and it was probably one of the best I've tasted in recent memory. The decor was trendy and immaculate. The area had a great vibe. The wait staff was extremely attentive, accommodating, and easy on the eyes. The food was not overly expensive for what you're getting.  We sat next to the management staff during our meal. I overheard their conversations and they take Yelp reviews very seriously. I appreciate their constant drive for improvement.  Overall, it was an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I do a few \"staycations\" here and there on the Las Vegas Strip. Where ever we stay is where we like to eat. Staying at Planet Hollywood we obviously ate at PH. There are a few places to choose from, and neither of us had tried BurGR, so we decided to pop a squat and eat.  The hostess was very sweet and informed us the wait for a table was about 30 minutes but we saw the \"21 & older\" area, there were a few open tables, so she sat us there instead. Now, knowing that this establishment is owned by Gordon Ramsay we expected to pay a few extra bucks but ultimately decided to just share our food because we were hungry, not starving.  We started with the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which are served with a delicious truffle aioli sauce, followed by some Jalapeno poppers, which were also amazing. We shared a Euro Burger which is patty, truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and a roasted tomato. Needless to say, I enjoyed my meal as did my boyfriend. Total wait for all of our food...20 minutes give or take, which I did not mind because there were distractions all around us that we were able to wait on and take our minds off of being hungry.  We must have came on a good night because reading some of these reviews people had to wait for their food for over 45 minutes, the service sucked, and then there are those who don't want to fork up a few extra dollars. You're paying for the Gordon Ramsay name, not necessarily the food.   Anyway, I loved this place."}
{"text":"Visited on 7/7/2014  Food: Ordered the Earth Burger. Very delicious grilled portobello mushroom and cheese burger. The bun was thick and crispy. The burger size was actually the perfect size; not too big but not too small. Definitely would return.  Service: Our waiter was very helpful and knew the menu very well. He made his recommendations and ensured what we were getting was going to be worth it.  Decor: Flames adorn the entrance of Gordon Ramsey's BurGR, which appeals to his passionate personality (at least on TV, anyway). The restaurant was very spacious and includes bar or table seating. Our table and area was very clean."}
{"text":"Best burger ever!!! I had the southern Yardbird  (chicken  burger). The flavors were perfect! The sweet potato  fries were awesome too. My blood orange cosmo was a great addition. We were seated at the bar and the bar staff was great. We had a 30 min wait but it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday evening during MDW and was glad that the line wasn't insanely ridiculous. I probably waited about 30 minutes which is pretty good considering I've read some reviews that people had to wait over an hour to eat here!  Once my boyfriend and I were seated, I immediately admired all the little details this restaurant had put attention into. The menus were really creative and the restaurant itself is beautiful and actually has flames around the entrance! Our server was friendly and funny and I liked how I could order drinks off of the iPad, it was a nice touch.   My only complaint is that it took a WHILE to get my food. I wasn't in a rush or anything, but I was definitely hungry once my food came. My boyfriend and I ordered the onion rings, farm burger, and Hell's kitchen burger. It took at least 30 minutes to get my food, but the place was packed and my food was fresh off the grill, so I can't really complain but after waiting to eat there and then waiting to eat my food, I was pretty hAngry.   Luckily the food more than made up for the wait. The onion rings were SO good. They weren't oily at all and the dressings that came with it were so creative. I believe one was cheddar ranch and it was to die for. Who would've thought to put those together? My boyfriend ordered the farm burger and he said it was delicious! I tried a bite out of it and I thought it was great too! I ordered the hell's kitchen burger which I liked better out of the two. The meat was really good quality and it was an interesting blend of ingredients. I would say that I was just a little disappointed because it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be, but that might be a good thing cause I could enjoy a small kick of heat without my mouth being on fire.  Our total came out to be about $45 including tax and tip and it was pretty worth it since the burgers are pretty big and I had half of my burger to eat for later and they even packed me up extra cheddar ranch sauce cause I loved it so much. Overall, I'd definitely come back here again and try something else on the menu!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and came visit again a couple days ago. Both food and service were consistent in quality. Their farm burger is undoubtedly one of the best burgers I have had. Ingredients are fresh and cooked to perfection. The fish sandwich was also top notch, so fresh and delicious. Service was quick and attentive. This place is a must try in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Yelp didn't go wrong with this one!  We were in the area and did a yelp search for a good restaurant, and voila.  We had been watching the fountains at Bellagio and wanted somewhere nearby.  Anyway, we found the restaurant, and then saw the line to get a seat and almost left (it was Friday night).  But the guy in front of us in line overheard us and told us not to leave, the wait was worth it.  He comes at least every year.  So alas we waited.  So glad we did!  It didn't end up taking too long anyway.    I asked the waiter what was good, so we ordered his top two recommendations.  I got the Farm burger and my husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger, and we got the truffle parmesan fries.  It did take a while for the food to come, so we ordered a beer each.  They have a good variety of beers on tap.    When the food came out, I was in love.  My hubby and I split our burgers (such a good man), so we could try both of them.  I loved every bite of each!  The farm burger had bacon (duck breast bacon, apparently- although I wouldn't know the difference, it was good), cheddar, and a fried egg.  I ordered it medium, and it was perfect, one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  The hell's kitchen burger had a number of spicy things on it (jalapenos, spicy cheese, etc), so I was a little nervous after reading the description that it would be too spicy to enjoy, but it was just right.  It had a good bite without being to spicy that your taste buds went numb.  And I was leery about getting the truffle parmesan fries, I adamantly do not like mushrooms but I'm trying to expand my palate, and the waiter said people love them.  So glad we listened, they were excellent!  The sauces that came with them were pretty good too.  I forget what they were, something along the aioli lines and something a bit spicy-ketchuppy.   When in Vegas, WE WILL BE BACK!  Fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Totally don't waste your time.  Burgers were only so-so and the fries were dry....add 2 diet cokes....$70 bill.  Add the bad service....not worth it.  It was amazing...amazingly bad."}
{"text":"Ordered the American Burger and Just Fries.  The burger was one of the best I have had and the fries were tasteful and plentiful A++  Please open a location in LA !!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent ambience was good food was delicious.  Had onion rings and jalapeno poppers for an appetizer and they were delicious. I had a portobella mushroom burger so big I only ate 1/3 of it even though I wanted to eat it all.  Friends all ate burgers and said they were great.  Waitress was great too.  Very friendly. Lines were long but my husband has a diamond card so we got to skip the line but even if I had to wait it would be worth it. Go to this place!"}
{"text":"Wow.... I was looking forward to a delicious, burger with quality ingredients and a concern for preparation. Sat at the bar, ordered a guinness and the blue burger. I also ordered the parmesean fries.  Then it went downhill. The bartender made a huge deal out of me ordering it medium rare - \"are you sure, that's going to be red in the middle?\" Yep - that's what I want.    Then, of course, it comes and it is barely pink in the center.  I forgive the cook because the patty was about 5oz.  How would you get that to MR? Then I tasted it.  Yes, I have had maytag blue cheese, yes, I know its strong. NO - I didn't expect it to be all I tasted and with the rind put on the burger. I tried getting thought it because I didn't want to get ripped by the bartender again. I couldn't.  I left 3/4 on the plate. When she asked if everything was OK - I explained.  She asked if I wanted to order anything else.... for a moment I thought she was offering to replace it.  Nope, just wanted to know if I wanted more food.  Um - why would I spend another $20 on more food when this is so bad.  The fries were good."}
{"text":"When I saw the there was an elite event for this I was over joyed. Then more bummed when I had to take back my RSVP because I couldn't attend the entire event. My baby sister only could baby sit til 12 :( boooohoo.   Anyway I'm not one to let an opportunity pass me by so the same night as the event, I went and had dinner here. I even saw misti setting up the table and she was awesome e nought to give me yelp mints and congratulate me for still coming to dinner here  Now onto the meal..  It wasn't as good as before. Bummer. The fries were overly salty and cheesed and came out cold. The burger was delicious and warm but lacked seasoning.   It took forever to get us refills and I was a very upset at the hostess stand. My friend made a joke and one blonde rolled her eyes and ignored my husbands question and continued gossiping with three other hostess. I really don't get why there's 8 hostess. That's crazy and dumb. Three was more than enough."}
{"text":"Where to start...my husband and I love G.R n watch all his shows and are big fans .we were so excited to go try his resturant  ...there was a massive wait but we waited n figured it would be worth it my burger was (good) not amazing not the best just good I ordered the hells kitchen burger..we we orders the gooey fries the flavor was good but the fries tasted stale and not fresh.we order the wings and we were expecting these amazing fresh wings n they also disappointed.so we didn't eat them ..we told our waitress we weren't happy with them you could tell she was bothered when we told her  and forcefully took them off our bill n didn't even say thank u after she just placed the check on our table so she wasn't happy about our complaint..over all not worth the price  my husband and I were just disappointed being chef ramsey and his high standards  we were excepting so so so much better ."}
{"text":"I also want to give it a 3.5 stars for \"good, but not excellent\" I had the Hell's kitchen burger- it was good, meat cooked to a nice pink medium rare, roasted pepper was juicy and mildly spicy, avocado was creamy. It was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Nice to try but wouldn't go back for it. Umami Burger in SF/LA is still way tastier. Sorry Gordon!  Note: One burger is super rich and we were fill halfway through our burgers. My bf and I each had one and could hardly eat our truffle fries. My advice is to finish your burgers first and then see if you have room for fries. Otherwise it's such a waste because fries just don't taste good once they're stale. Or, you could share just split one burger and order the fries."}
{"text":"Had the American Burger, Onion Rings, and a couple of IPAs.  Really really good food and great service.  Place was packed but the food was great.  Definitely worth hitting up if you're in the area and craving a good burger."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Vegas for a couple days and made sure to visit a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. We ended up getting burgers here and taking it back to our timeshare. Ordering at the front was simple and quick.  I ordered the Farm Burger, medium. Even with the 15-20 min trip from getting our food to taking it back to our timeshare, the meat was still perfectly medium. The duck breast bacon was tasty and the fried egg soaked my bun pretty well to give it extra flavor. My wife ordered the American Burger and she seemed to enjoy the simplicity of it. We shared the truffle parmesan fries, which wasn't bad, but not extremely good. It might've had a little too much truffle parmesan. Still, we enjoyed our meal here and want to try GR's other restaurants when we're back in town."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey Resturant.  Yes there was a line to get in, but it moved quickly.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  I went fancy when I ordered, American burger and fries.   Was not able to finish all of it (fries) as there was a lot.  The burger, nothing  survived.  It was excellent.  Priced a little high but worth the experience.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Some pretty darn good burgers. Everything we had was fantastic. The fries are WONDERFUL! Good service. We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and helpful. Love the location and view."}
{"text":"Amazing food, every time we come to Vegas we stop by here! The bacon jalapeño poppers are amazing !! Everything we have tried has never disappointed us, the staff if on top of it and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu ."}
{"text":"Possibly THE best burger that I have had in my life. Truffle burger, gooey fries, onion rings..... Oh my god.... If I could give this place 10 stars I would!!! Do not miss out!!!"}
{"text":"First, there was a line to get in. Moved quite fast, so that's not a problem. However, food took way too long!!  Our chicken came out (very delicate and flavorful), and beer battered onion rings (again, very delicate and flavorful) quite quickly. My problem is, even after we finished those 2 dishes - we waited additional 35 mins exactly to be served our Hell's Kitchen burger! My server was no where to be found, had to ask others on the status of or food. Anyway, we ordered our meat to be medium and ASKED our server to confirm medium is pink and no blood?? She looked at me as if I was an idiot and disrespectfully stated NO. So, I asked, NO as in NO blood? And she said, NO BLOOD. Fine, medium please.  And what do we have here? Looks like rare!! Blood scorching out!! I called my server and said, 'you specifically answered my specific question and stated No Blood! Are you blind? Then she sighted and walked away. I was so blown away with this outrageous disrespect, I paid my bill without even taking 1 bite out of my burger and walked out. I feel bad giving 1 star since everyone from host to other servers were very pleasant - but my server ruined my experience at this place."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of times in Vegas as it was quite good.  Had the hog burger the 1st time, I wasnt a fan.  Had a very weird taste.  The Steak Fries were cooked perfectly.  They give some flavored ketchup with the fries and I asked for regular ketchup which didn't taste much better.  I wish they didn't screw with something that wasn't broken.  I think they were getting a bit too creative for their own good.  Had a regular burger the 2nd time around, this time it was great.  Right size, not huge, cooked perfectly.  Delicious.  I am still thinking about it.   They have a gimmicky IPAD they bring to your table that talks about all the desserts, and drinks etc.  The waitresses spend so much time trying to wow you with useless use of technology, you are led to believe you could order the things on the menu from the IPAD, but you cannot. You still have to order it from the waitress.  Not a big deal but why waste our time with the Ipad if you aren't going to utilize it to order?  Just a pet peeve.. Skip the ipad's and shave a couple bucks off your burgers...   Fries were great.. Get some and split it with a friend.  For $11 ea they better be amazing."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night around 7:30pm (should've been earlier but I got lost..). The hostess very prompt to greet and help the guests. I think there were 2 hosts..? She said the wait was about two and a half hours. Gave her our number and we'll get a text to come back for our table. You get 10 minutes to come back.  Got a snack at earl's and walked around. By 9:30 we got a text and quickly walked back to BurGR. Was quickly seated. So many attentive and hot waiter/waitresses. Getting some help was never a problem. Our waitress gave us an iPad of the drink menu. Tapping on a name shows us a picture of the drink and its description. Very useful!  I got the Farm Burger ($15) with medium rare meat. Delicious! Egg was a little small though. What impressed me most was the coffee/toffee/hazelnut shake (#5). The best shake I've ever had in my life. So smooth and flavorful!   The decor was fancy dark but still enough lighting to keep our eyes healthy and take instagram photos!"}
{"text":"A group of us were in Vegas for a bachelorette party and the bride's mother-in-law invited us to lunch here on our first day before we started the festivities. Despite being called off the wait list, we still had to wait over 20 minutes before a table finally freed up. After we did get seated, it took forever for our waitress to check on us and service was just plain bad for the rest of our meal as it was impossible to flag anyone down for anything.  We ended up ordering truffle parmesan fries & sweet potato fries to share - the fries were pretty good. I got the southern yardbird burger - the meat is very tender and juicy but the burger is SO large that it's almost impossible to eat.  Overall, not worth it IMO to wait in long line for crappy service and slightly above average food."}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. Seating was a pain. We went fairly early and had to split up our larger group. However we saw two tables close together and they wouldn't allow us to switch seats. Their excuse is there's a rotation of some sort. Come on! The line is out the door. People will be flowing into regardless. Put a sour taste in my mouth really. Burger was good but sometimes customer service trumps the overall experience."}
{"text":"I came here on New Year's Day to have lunch, and seeing that I wasn't a Total Rewards 'Platinum' member, I waited in line for about 25 minutes before I was finally seated. That was actually a pretty reasonable amount of wait time, seeing as this is Vegas during peak season.  I ordered some beer-battered onion rings to start with, and was not disappointed. The onion rings were huge! It also came with a couple of dipping sauces which were as delicious as they sound - chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch.  For the main course, I got myself the 'Britannica' burger, which includes a topping of arugula and mango chutney. The meat was cooked just right, the mango chutney tasted nice and tangy, but what really sealed the deal were the buns - they were soft and full of flavor, despite being just bread.   The prices aren't too bad, at about $15 a burger on average. This is a Gordon Ramsay eatery, not McDonald's. If you're not comfortable with venturing any further from the Dollar Menu, the 25 minute wait in line should give you plenty of time to make some budget-wise decisions.  Will definitely come back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"First the service was great, second the beer list was quite nice, but most important, the burger. Great! The meat was amazingly consistently pink. The bun and toppings done perfectly too. In short, I was impressed, and I have had a lot great burgers. (Hells kitchen burger)"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my boyfriend here since he is a big fan of hells kitchen. The line was super long, waited for 25 mins for burger and fries. I ordered truffle burger, and it was wayyy underwhelming. It almost tasted like lamb burger for some reason (maybe they gave me a wrong burger with goat cheese..?I have no idea) and It tasted mediocre. It is all a big hype, it was not worth the wait nor the price. The waitress was attentive though. Except that, I would not go there again."}
{"text":"Great Onion rings, long lines and limited Vegetarian options.     I can't say this is the best burger place I've been, or even a top contender.  As a vegetarian, I expect a fancy burger joint to have a housemade veggie or vegan burger to choose from.  Growing up as a vegetarian, I always had two options at restaurant: A frozen gardenburger or a portabella mushroom sandwich.  Now, those were the days when vegetarians were few and far between.   But now when I see those options, I think lazy and uncreative, definitely not what I would expect from a Gordon Ramsey establishment.  I ordered the only option I had as a vegetarian, a mushroom burger made like their cheesy burger.  It was a bunch of sliced portabella mushrooms stacked on top of each other, which was impossible to eat. With each bite a slippery slice flew out of my bun until I finally gave up and pulled all the mushrooms out.  Luckily, I really enjoyed their truffle fries and housemade onion rings, so the experience was not a complete bust.    The server was attentive and noticed that I didn't not eat much of my food, and asked if I did not care for it. I told her I just wasn't a fan of the mushrooms but it was fine.  She insisted on taking it off the bill... which was not expected but appreciated.   All said and done...  No, I will not wait 45 minutes to dine here again."}
{"text":"Very crowded. Wait time 45 minutes to an hour. If you're in line waiting a hostess will take your party info and text you when your table is ready. You have 10 minutes to show up or they give your table away. Very energetic restaurant. We were seated and service was prompt considering restaurant was extremely busy. Prices are fair and portions are adequate. Look to spend around $20 to $30 per person. It's definitely worth trying at least once for the experience and to say you've eaten at Gordon Ramsay Burgr. In my opinion Fatburger, In and Out, Smashburger are all just as tasty and easier on your wallet. They offer an extensive beer selection also. Appetizers were tasty, we had the hummus and pork belly Asian Bao buns. The burgers were delicious and everyone was pleased. They serve fancy ketchup by the way, no Hienze 57 at Gordon Ramsay, lol. You will get tangy Chipotle ketchup, Gordons take on ketchup I guess. 5 of us dined and the bill was $143 including tip and everyone was happy and full. Excellent server, Jared was knowledgeable, friendly and very attentive. The waitresses are cute in little red zip up mini dresses. I would definitely eat there again on a special occasion."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar since I ate myself. I had the Earth Burger which was vegetarian. It came with grilled portabello mushroom, fontina cheese, arugula, and roasted tomatoes. If you love mushrooms, then this i the burger for you. There were 3-4 layers of mushroom in the burger. Otherwise, the flavors were okay. I thought it was expensive for $15 which was one of the most expensive burgers on the menu.   I wish there were smaller portions for the sweet potato fries. I asked if they could make a half portion, but they said no.   Service was fine for me."}
{"text":"Hostess not so nice and completely ignored us upon arriving, but the the rest of the experience was well worth the visit. If in Vegas I will be coming back, and hope they have nicer hostess. This review was based on our visit in Sept. 2016"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service! The Euro Burger & Wings are delicious! Kelsey and Douglas were great! Very helpful!"}
{"text":"Best Burger on the planet!  The burger I purchased had duck breast bacon and it was insane.  I've tried a lot of different burgers and this one has been the best so far.  Great atmosphere, presentation, service and pricing as well."}
{"text":"Their burger is delicious. I was expecting it to be all hyped up. In my opinion,I'd rather pay few extra dollars to get a burger here than shake shack (this is my personal preference).   Our server, Alex, was one of the best servers I've had. He knew the menu inside and out. He would ask you the right questions to make sure the entrée you ordered was the right one for you.   If this is your first time here then I would recommend getting the ice cream / cake push pop for dessert.   The wait was painful for us. A party of eight during the lunch rush hour was a two hour wait. But seeing Gordon Ramsay in person made it a little bit worth it.   Btw, soba salad has no lettuce, kale nor spinach. They're noodles with a sprinkle of greens, some chicken and dressing."}
{"text":"My family and friends ate here to celebrate my birthday and even though it was Thursday during lunch time, the wait time was really long, but it was definitely worth it. We had the best hamburgers we ever had in our lives!  We had the hell's kitchen hamburger, the Euro burger, the American and Blue.  We went back the next day for more lol"}
{"text":"Burgers were delicious!!!  Onion rings were very disappointing.  Luke warm, super doughy. We sent them back & received fresh ones.  They were better but not great too much batter.   Truffle fries were just ok.  Thick cut fries.    Kids dessert push-ups were amazing & bday espresso shake for Mom was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay. I've watched his shows (Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares UK and USA, Masterchef) and been intrigued as to which of his Vegas restos (he got 3 here) should I try first. BurGR seemed to be the best choice to start (and the cheapest).  The 30 min wait was expected. Bleh...  Food: I got the $14 Farm Burger (duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar cheese and a fried egg), $7 Just Fries with curry and chipotle ketchup, and the $8 Shake #5 (chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee shake and a praline cookie).  First off, let's talk about the burger. The burger was good with the oozing, decadent egg yolk and the crispy bacon which added a nice crunch component. I honestly though wasn't blown away by it and I would probably would want to try the other burgers on the menu if i came back here again.  Secondly, the shake was rich and sweet. I thought the coffee shake tasted like a butterscotch candy in liquid form and the pudding was pretty thick. The one thing I would change would be the ratio. I noticed the glass that they put 1/2 the amount of pudding and 1/2 of the shake. When I finished the shake portion on the bottom, all I was left with was the pudding. Being that it was soooo rich, I wasn't able to finish that. So next time, I would ask for 95% shake and 5% pudding. FYI, i overhead a lady next to me telling the waiter she didn't like her shake bc it was too sweet.   Lastly, the fries. I didn't care much for the fries. The curry and chipotle ketchups were ok tasting. The one thing that I was disappointed in was that the fries were not crispy AT ALL. When the bacon in your burger is crispy and your fries are not, it really downgrades the experience. I would probably try the sweet potato fries next time.  Ambience: Though i wasn't really impressed with the food, this was probably one of the nicest restos i've ever seen! The room had a lot of tables with some tvs and really nice decor (flames and fire inspired).   Staff: The staff was very well-dressed and professional. Our server (I think his name was Ryan) was great and he was very cordial and knowledgable about menu. The ladies are dressed in very well-fitted (like Star Trek fitted) dresses and the men are in polos with jeans that I observed had \"GR\" on the back pockets.   \"I have a very assertive way. Its wake up, move your ass, or piss off home.\" - Gordon Ramsay"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars because I am the person that says, \"there's only so much you can do with a hamburger\" but this place proved me wrong.  I have always seen the \"fried egg\" on a burger option but never thought it sounded too good.  Being here though, I wanted to try something new and ordered it.  Wholly Cow!  (pun intended)  It was an amazing hamburger.  I can't wait to go back.  None of use were real thrilled with the fries but we did finish off our first round of onion rings and asked for a second order before we were done.  Our waiter was friendly and we couldn't have asked for better service.  They had a line but we just gave them my mobile number and they text me just before our table was ready so we were able to go up to the room real quick before dinner.  Everyone at my table was loving dinner that night."}
{"text":"First off, we came with a party of 11 people ranging from ages 15-25. Mostly people in their 20s. We called earlier asking to make a reservation but they told us they don't take reservations. When we got there we were able to immediately go to the front of the line and quickly tell the hostess. We were then told that the tables would be ready in about an hour and they were.   PRICE- averages about $15 to $18 per burger. Fries are about $10 along with dessert. Quite pricey but not overly expensive for a famous chef's restaurant. Definitely not a place I would repeatedly go to.   FOOD- I really liked the food. I ordered the truffle fries and the euro burger. For dessert I had the toffee pops. However I can't say it was the best because i was given a medium burger rather than medium rare. As a chef who emphasizes such things on TV, I was highly disappointed. ALSO 3 of my other family members received an overcooked and dry burger. Despite that I just continued to eat it seeing as how we were starving and in a rush. The vegetables and seasoning was perfect on the burger but like I said, mine was a bit dry. The truffle Parmesan fries are enough for two people. They were quite delicious with the sauces they came with! The toffee pops were good as well! It's just the flavor scan be a bit overwhelming by themselves. Get them Togo! The design on those were genius, seeing how they prevented messiness. They were pretty sweet with a saltiness to them. It reminded me of drum stick ice cream consistency. The cake layers were delicious. I just wished they made it so that there was a cake core with the toffee pudding surrounding it. That way you could get the taste of both of them together.   SERVICE-OUR WAITRESS WAS HORRIBLE. She was polite enough when we came. She got our orders down. After probably a 40 minute wait, she comes to tell us our food will be out in about 5 minutes. Come 15 minutes later, our food is out. This was expected seeing as how our party was quite large. Now I must say, we only saw her twice throughout the whole 2 hours we were there. NOT once did she check up on us again and NOT once did she refill our drinks or bring any food out. Now I know this lady existed seeing as how she was catering to all the other tables around us. The only thing that SAVED this, was a man who wasn't even our waiter. He was a busboy or something. He was super attentive to our drinks and super polite. He took additional orders for us, took our empty plates, and checked up on us regularly. Of course we had gratuity on our large bill however we initially wanted to add to our gratuity. When we found out that the man who was ACTUALLY serving us wasn't getting ANY of the bill, we gave him the extra $20 personally.   ATMOSPHERE- it was quite loud and busy in the restaurant. And this was around 3:30-7pm on a Friday. Of course it's very possible to have a conversation, but be expected to wait quite awhile in the line. It's more of a casual setting.   All in all, service by MY waitress was horrible. But the staff was good. Not my waitress she sucks and I hope she never sees that gratuity that she doesn't deserve. Food was expensive but not as bad as other fancy restaurants. Food was tasty but not the standards I was expecting. Casual setting. I probably wouldn't go here again unless it's a special occasion. Definitely an experience so no regrets."}
{"text":"BF wanted a burger yesterday after gaming nearby, decided to come back here only because we really wanted the jalapeno poppers again. Unfortunately, they've taken them off the menu. :(   We got the onion rings instead to start, they were good. I ordered the Patriot burger which was a turkey burger with cherry compote, fried onion bits, and cheese, delicious!  He had the Hell's kitchen burger and added bacon. We split the truffle fries again. The food is delicious! Last time I had the portabello burger and it was meh, this time, delicious!  I take back my previous statement, I can justify paying the $$ for the quality.  Absolutely stuffed the rest of the night. Next time, I'm getting the hot dog. The older couple seated next to us had it and it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had!! Service was exceptional. ..our server helped us narrow down what we wanted. I ordered the Euro burger...with goat cheese. Omg!! It was heavenly! ! Husband had the Farm burger...he loved it. We also had the onion rings and truffle fries.... we could not finish our food. Everything was perfect and it's absolutely beautiful inside. Ramsey knows how to put everything together for a fun, delicious meal experience!"}
{"text":"I'm normally really skeptical of Vegas restaurants.  You never get your moneys worth.  But I will say BurGR is an exception, mainly because I was stuffed and didn't break the bank.  BurGR has a lot of things that usually turn me off, mainly because it seems like it's a tourist trap and has a long line.  But I was pleased with how my burger turned it, it was really good.  I had the chicken burger and even that was really good."}
{"text":"I'll admit it.  I'm a Gordon Ramsay groupie.  I DVR all of his shows from Master Chef to Hell's Kitchen to Kitchen Nightmare's.  And once or twice in my life, I've been lucky enough to eat at one of his many restaurants.  This past weekend, my friends and I were in Sin City for a birthday celebration and we decided to try the newly opened BurGR.  I'm not even slightly exaggerating when I say that the Farmhouse Burger that I ate at Gordon's new restaurant is the best burger I've ever eaten in my life.  Perfectly seasoned beef topped with Duck Bacon (which I didn't even know existed), French Cheddar, and a gooey fried egg....it was like eating a piece of art.  In addition to the burger, my friends and I shared some truffle parmesan french fries with BurGR's homemade truffle aioli and ketchup sauces (both amazing).  We also ordered creme brulee oreo milkshakes (best milkshake I've ever had).  The only dish that we ordered that I was less than ecstatic about was the honeypig bao buns appetizer...but honestly, the rest of the meal was so amazing, we completely forgot about it.  At a fairly reasonable price for Ramsay level quality food, I highly recommend trying out BurGR next time you're at the Planet Hollywood Casino in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting 3-Michelin-star cuisine, but I still left disappointed.  After being seated in front of a large, awkward picture of Ramsay, my family and I were presented with drink options on a fancy iPad. Whatever, not impressed.  Our orders came out quite quickly. Here's a breakdown of what I ate:  1. Truffle parmesan fries ($11) - Too salty, too thick-cut.  2. Chanterelle burger ($16) - The chanterelle mushrooms were too salty, but the patty was delicious and well-seasoned. I wish the burgers could come with fries.  3. Fish & crisp sandwich ($16) - Quite tasty.  4. Sticky toffee pudding push up pops ($7 for two) - Way too sweet. My parents were actually visibly disgusted by how sweet these were.  Service was good, but I felt bad for the waitresses who had to wear skin-tight skimpy dresses. Sure this is Vegas, but it's a little awkward having breasticles in my face every time I got my water refilled. Also, the guys' outfits looked like they were straight out of a gay bar.  All things considered, it was an okay experience that cost too much. Won't be coming back even though I'm a big fan of the chef patron."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay has 3 restaurants in Vegas and during my trip to Sin City, I was eager to try one of them. Definitely glad it was this one because GR sure knows what he's doing when it comes to burgers!!!   My party of 5 came here on Friday for brunch. There wasn't a wait yet at 11AM but after we finished our meal, we saw a ~30-minute queue to be seated. While I'm glad I didn't have to wait in line...I wouldn't mind doing so for these bougie burgers.   After browsing the menu, I settled on the Farm Burger w/ duck breast bacon & a fried egg. It seemed to be a popular option and the waiter even confirmed that it was his personal favorite so I didn't have any \"buyer's remorse\" about my choice.   The burger itself was very rich and juicy. The hero of the meal was the runny egg, which was a really nice touch. I enjoyed my burger...however, my bf's Hog Burger was a burger of impossibly EPIC proportions!!! After first bite, I was sold. It was flavorful, savory, had that magical X-factor, and I definitely see why it got a special spot on the menu apart from the other selections. If it sounds like I have the biggest school girl crush on it, it's because I do.   Aside from our main course, we also ordered a portion of truffle fries to share. The fries were a hit! Our waiter suggested we order 2 for 5 people and when the fries came out in a cone, I questioned our decision of ordering just 1... The portion size looked dinky for $10. However, it ended up being just right because we were all full from our burgers.   Service here was also spectacular, which was not surprising because GR is known for running a tight ship. Ambiance is also relaxed so you don't need to be dressed to the nines.   Overall.... I had a GRand time GRubbing here. You might even say it was the best burGR I've ever had ;)."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!  Amazing staff. We sat at the chefs bar and watched the kitchen staff work. It's stunning the amount of teamwork and dedication the staff demonstrated.  We'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Took a long time for the food to come. When it finally came it wasn't even that good. It was blown out of the park by the burger joint across the street from my school where I can get a burger for 5$ instead of 18$"}
{"text":"This place was amazing he made this place just amazing there was literally nothing bad with the food  it was simply bomb and greatness the burger selection was off the chain"}
{"text":"One of my must go spots. The wait isn't too long and you can leave your number with the hostess and they'll text you when your table is ready. Bao buns, sweet potato fries, and farm burger are my favorites."}
{"text":"I watch GR's \"Kitchen Nightmares\" and he gets upset when customers have to wait.  Well, he should stop by his own restaurant.  There was an hour wait to get in.  So if you go there hungry, you will be REALLY be hungry by the time you are seated.  We were seated at 3:30pm and our food didn't arrive until 4:20pm. Seriously, 50 minutes wait for a hamburger!?!  We were at a table facing the kitchen and could see the cooks were always moving.  The runners picked up the food as soon as it hit the waiting area.  So I don't know what the holdup was.  Maybe they don't have enough cooks.  We went with friends that ordered burgers, but I didn't want beef.  I was surprised that there wasn't a chicken patty type burger on the menu except for the sliders which I ordered.  But I was hungrier than that by then and could have used a larger chicken or turkey burger.  The chicken sliders were just ok.  I kept stealing the avocado off my husband's burger to give it some flavor.  My husband had a Hell's Kitchen burger, but he said it was not that spicy.  But that might be a matter of taste or taste buds.  The two winning things about the restaurant: the decor and our waitress."}
{"text":"This is the second tome I come to this restaurant and want it to above average, and it just doesn't happen. We had the Hells burger and the euro and all were over cooked, the ingredients made the burger tolerable so it wasn't that bad; the parmesan fries weren't ok. The best thing we had here were the roasted jalapeno poppers, those were crispy, spicy and included cheddar and bacon. They have some good beers on tap but I've had my BURGR'S  experience satisfied for my lifetime. $120 for an appetizer, 3 beers, 3 burgers, and fries; I think for the price I had higher expectations. (Service was good though)"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Waited in line for less than avg. Burger.  Only thing awesome about this joint is their custard hybrid milk shakes."}
{"text":"The Truffle Parmesan fries are AWESOME!!! The burgers are cooked very well, and are very tasty, but we still prefer Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay better.  What held this back would be the size and seasoning of the burgers (burgers a little on the small size and could use more seasoning on their \"just fries\" and Farm Burger.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is very nice (they play great music)."}
{"text":"Within 10 minutes all of us got sick, don't know if it was the undercooked burgers or the parmesan truffle French Fries. I see from the reviews below that we are not the only ones that got a touch of food poisoning from this place. We did tell the management later that day after we all purged and they did offer us a refund, we declined. I don't need a free lunch.  Just make it good!!  There are too many great places to eat in Vegas; this is not one of them."}
{"text":"Grabbed a Farm Burger, Hog Burger and Onion rings. Burgers were executed perfectly and delicious but the onion rings were the ones to blow us with the parmejan cheese!! Service was great and place very clean, would recommend it"}
{"text":"Euroburger was very good. Could have been served hotter. No side dish included. Specialty french fries $11-$15 extra. It was good, but it could have included some side dish. Pricey for a burger."}
{"text":"I honestly don't think it met basic minimum expectations, and I'm a huge fan of Chef Ramsay..  What went well, nothing at all...  The long wait in the line, was expected, but didn't seem justified as there were several open tables and view...  The flavors of the hell's burger and the Farm burger was good maybe if the food was warm enough..  The onion rings and the French fries were mediocre at best.. The chili dog was good, but a little too spicy for me.  Service? Really poor.. We sat at the bar, and the gentleman behind the bar like any sense of hospitality... You'd expect some sense of interaction with the people at the bar, but none of that.. The kitchen? Not good at all.. Our order was confused three times, the appetizers did not come out first, the burgers did, the appetizers were delayed and when they serve the burgers afterwards they were already cold... The guys to my left had similar problem with their food was confused with something else... So between taking a long time to deliver the food, not delivering the appetizers as expected, delivering the cold, the whole experience went downhill fast... Since this happened to the guys next to me to my left it seems like the kitchen was out of control... I would not recommend this"}
{"text":"Came here right before getting on my flight back home. Big mistake. I should have come here when I first arrived and everyday after that. Food was excellent. Wife and I sat right by the kitchen at the bar watching the food come out. Mistake #2 when you're starving because everything looks good. I got the Hells Kitchen Burger and wifey got the huge chili dog. One bite and we looked at each other like OMG why didn't we come here sooner. Topped it off with some parmesan truffle fries and that was all she wrote. Service was top notch, food was excellent. Can't wait to go back to Vegas so I can eat here at least 3 times during my trip."}
{"text":"With Gordon Ramsey's name on the door, you would have a higher expectation. Well, maybe he should just focus on fine dinning because the burger is really just ok. And with the volume of business in Vegas, it is impossible to control the quality.. So I am disappointed..   The price is reasonable. And the milkshake is really good. But other than that, there's nothing crazy about this place.."}
{"text":"We went on a Monday night around 8pm and the line was long. It wouldnt have been so bad if the heat from the sign wasnt making us both sweat like pigs.  Thank God we werent seated by that fire window of hell! Anywho, clearly we both ordered milk shakes which were amazing until we got to the bottom and the pudding that was formerly on the top was all that was left. It was a thick almost flavorless gunk that was less than appetizing which we could have easily done without. Having worked in restaurants it was disappointing to wait in line for almost 45 minutes to get inside and see that most of the staff had no sense of urgency. Tables that were empty sat uncleaned for much longer than I would expect and the appetizer didnt come out until after we were finished with our shakes. The wings were awesome and both burgers were delish (Farm & Hells Kitchen) but being 8 months preggo I ordered medium well and it was at best medium rare but I made it this far so I figured whats a little blood! Lol The fries and onion rings were average but the sauces were wonderful compliments.  Long story short great food, polite knowledgeable server but slooow service and such horrible outfits on such pretty girls. We will return for the food expecting a wait, undercooked burgers (which normally I like) and milk shakes hopefully without the icky pudding!"}
{"text":"Klassiske høykbalitetsburgere. Håndlagede burger lages på grillen før de legges myke hamburgerbrød med sesam. Burgerne toppes med tradisjonell salat, tomat og rødløk, man kan også få mango eller ananas sammen med burgeren."}
{"text":"Visited GR Burgr twice on a 3 day visit to Vegas. Overall impressions: superb burgers. One of the best we've had and we've had some amazing burgers including the very best at Peter Luger in NYC. Front window display of waving flames is quite a spectacle. Servers very good. Nice to interact with Scott, the Manager. First visit: started with the Pork Bao buns. We've had similar at Buddakan in NYC and they were pretty close to what we had before, which we love. Very nice elegant touch to the menu. Then we had the Farm Burgers. Loved the taste of the egg and duck breast bacon. Both were cooked beautifully and sooooo good. Manager Scott mentioned that meat was a combination of chuck, brisket and waygu (we think we have this right). Also had the Truffle fries with truffle aioli and house made ketchup. Not normally a fan of ketchup but this was fantastic. Second visit: we decided to order the Fish & Crisp sandwich as we noticed this at the pass on our first visit and had to try it somehow. It was freakin' good. The fish was lovely and the salt & vinegar crisps / fresh dill tartar sauce was perfect accompaniment. So glad we could fit it in as it seems to be overlooked by the amazing burgers. For our 'mains', we ordered two Uber Cheese burgers and added a fried egg on both. Again, cooked perfectly and the meat was stupendous. Purchased a GR plate to go with our GR Steak placemat for our home. Overall, we loved both of our visits and would absolutely not hesitate to visit on our next trip. In fact, we would book each day with GR Burgr to ensure we tried as much of the menu as possible. Thank you Gordon!"}
{"text":"Our burgers were mediocre at best. Small tasteless patties w fancy toppings. We're from the south , we've had burgers all over the US and this was one of the most disappointing. $60 later, we ended up with a better meal at In-N-out burger! You pay for the atmosphere and the name. I'd skip it. Not worth it at all."}
{"text":"I've had a bit of time to reflect before writing this review... The service was shit(see my check in and you'll realize why it took so look to cool down).  After the bar seating confusion, I was offered a decent beer.  The selection is wanting.  I understand it is limited by the vendor relationships you have, so we'll keep the draft list at sub par.     What really pissed me off is how the chef let my medium burger come out as fucking well done!!! Seriously!?!?!?!?! All you cook is burgers how can you not tell the temperature by now?!?!?!?!  It was called the Britannia, which should insult the county for which its namesake came from.  Just a greasy over cooked piece of shit.  After 40 minutes, the bar tender came over and asked me if I'd like a second beer.  Yes! I finished my first beer 30 minutes ago with no water!  The waitress nor bar tenders had not asked me about my food(only dropped it off and then no questions). Probably good for them, because I've had better burgers from White Castle.  Gordon, please remove your name or close this place, because it's in a very pathetic decline.  I've come here numerous times and each time it is a little worse.    I would recommend that people go to Mario Batali's place \"b&b\". (Burger and beer).  This place picks up where Ramsey's place has sadly left off.  I've been to many of Ramsey's restaurants but will never go back here.  Pathetic."}
{"text":"I came here because I love Gordon Ramsay. Master Chef is one of my favorite shows and no he does not yell all the time on that show. Because of his prestige, I knew this place must be amazing.  Location -It was kind of hard to find b/c we walked from The Signature @ MGM Grand, and idk why BurGR isn't included on the Planet Hollywood map/directory! Anyways it's located right in the front next to Sephora. -There is a huge fire thing in the front. You won't miss it.  Service -Very friendly waiter and hostesses. The wait for a group of 9 was approx 1 hour. They text you when your table is ready, which is really convenient so that you don't have to wait at the restaurant. You can go lose money at the casinos instead. -They bring each table an iPad to look at drinks & desserts. They also bring an iTouch when you're paying the bill. Ooh fancy!  Food -I ordered the Chanterelle Burger. I asked for it to be cooked medium well (Yes I know meat tastes best medium/medium-rare, but I grew up eating everything well done so it's hard for me to eat lots of red). Instead it came out completely well done. Shake my head :( zero pinkness at all! I also added cheese to it because this is the only burger on the menu w/o cheese & I LOVE cheese. The flavor was great!! My stomach was already full, but my mouth wanted more so I finished the whole thing. -We also shared the Parmesan Truffle Fries. These were very fresh, but in my opinion nothing too great. I don't really like thickly sliced potatoes because they always end up having less flavor than skinny fries (like the ones at Yard House).   Overall, 4 stars b/c the burger flavor was delicious. Minus 1 star because the fries were okay & the price is kinda steep for the quantity you get."}
{"text":"If there were waitresses in Star Trek, they would look like the ones here.   Our party had to stand in a 10 minute line, not bad. Then they asked us to stand in a waiting area to be seated, got excited but then waited another 15 minutes.   Ordered the Farm Burger and Hell's Kitchen Burger with a friend, and they were happy to cut our burgers in half. Also got some onion rings and Parmesan truffle fries, both of which were just okay in my opinion.  Sauces for the fries were great, but the fry itself tasted kind of like cardboard...I was disappointed. The medium burgers could have been a little more pink around the edges of the patty; around the edges the patty was definitely well done.  Nevertheless, it was so tender and flavorful, so much umami, and you could really taste the quality of the ingredients.  Aside from the slightly slow service (30 min to get our burgers), Gordon Ramsay's restaurant makes a pretty mean burger."}
{"text":"When we arrived we were told the wait would be about an hour.  We gave our cell number and received a text alert when our table was ready, which ended up being less than an hour.  There is a Starbucks close by and we had a coffee while waiting to be texted.  Our waiter was excellent, very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  We each had a drink (I had Prosecco and my husband had a Jack and Coke), drinks were pretty much the same as all Vegas drinks (expensive!).  We both ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and shared an order of truffle fries.  The garlic and aioli sauce with the fries was INCREDIBLE.  Burgers were good and cooked almost (though not precisely) as ordered.  It is very pricey for a burger place but if you are visiting Vegas and are in the same \"when in Vegas\" mindset we were, you will be pleased."}
{"text":"The wait to be seated took about half an hour for our party of 5, but it was well worth the wait. Gordon Ramsay's burgers sure do live up to its hype for all tourists. Even if you're not a fan of burgers, it's worth the try. I highly recommend Hell's Kitchen burger. It's probably the best burger from the menu. I ordered the Farm burger and enjoyed that as well, but not as much as the Hell's Kitchen burger. I always go with medium rare meat when I get the chance to choose. This restaurant's meats are cooked to perfection. It was one of the best medium rares I've had and considering how jam-packed and busy they always are. Sweet potato fries are amaaaaaazing even though they cost $9. If you like truffle fries, those are worth the try if you are willing to spend a little more than $9 for fries. However, I prefer the sweet potato fries. Service was good. Our server checked on us regularly to make sure we were content. The restaurant as a whole seems consistent with what they do. Since it is located on The Strip, everything here will be around $10 or more. I just can't reiterate how much this experience is worth. You'll have to see for yourself. Surely, I'll be back whenever I am in Las Vegas again."}
{"text":"I had the truffle fries and the gordon burger (or was it the off the menu) burger. And let me get a side of heart attack while I am at it.    For the price I paid, I would say it is worth a try. Service was attentive (albeit there were not that many people there the day I went) and the overall atmosphere was almost perfect for heartburn.   Worth the calories? Maybe..but the flavors were not so extravagantly amazing that I can rave for days. Also, due to the hot weather in the area I would recommend going when Vegas gets a little colder. Because they do not clean the sticky seats....I guess theres no point....."}
{"text":"BurGR definitely lives up to the hype. The burgers were top notch. When we went the wait for the food was a little long and our waitress, while not out right rude, did not seem to enjoy being there and didn't seem to have much patience.   I was skeptical of the truffle aioli, but it was in fact delicious. I definitely suggest this restaurant to everyone and don't be scared of the aoili. :)"}
{"text":"Omg the Hell's kitchen burger was amazing!!! Spicy and very rich.The truffle fries were the icing on top of the cake. You can tell Mr. Ramsay put effort into these recipes. This place is a little pricey, you will spend about 30 in all but its worth the splurge!!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of Gordon Ramsey restaurant in Las Vegas. I went to the burger one in Planet Hollywood. It does take about 40 minutes to get in. The ambience is great and service was top notch. My daughter and myself got two different burgers and both were good in different ways. I do remember the fries the best as the gooey fries and sweet potato fries were completely different from what I've had in the past with fries. I would come here again to try other dishes. The fries are good at least for two people."}
{"text":"Meh. Went with a party of 12. My daughter loves Masterchef Junior and Kitchen Nightmares and was thrilled to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.   We had about an hour wait for our party, which wasn't bad - we were notified via sms when to return and seated.   We ordered pretty much all of the appetizers (sliders are great, avoid the served cold jalapeño poppers, bao buns and onion rings \"good\") , shakes, and between us almost every type of burger, and 2x of each type of fries.   I had a Hell's Kitchen burger and a Chocolate shake. The burger was \"just ok.\" I really, really, wanted it to be fantastic - especially coming from Los Angeles, where, well, people know their burgers.   But it wasn't: It was cooked well, constructed and presented well - however - the taste - just average. So Disappointing.    If you've ever had Umami, or Fathers Office burgers which are \"good to great\" - Gordon's BurGR wasn't even close.   And surprisingly, everyone around the table had similar comments. For a $480 tab. We won't be back.  Now - what was fantastic and deserves mention: The milkshakes. Mine had pudding on top. Pudding in a shake you say? I wasn't sure either - but it was an amazing combination.   I had shake #1 - caramel pudding, chocolate shake, toffee cookie  If there's one single reason we would return, it would be for the shakes."}
{"text":"Never disappoints. The lightest beef and the tastiest flavor combinations coupled with excellent service."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of GR, but I have to say the people in charge of Burgr are not keeping up with the place.  1. Long wait for a half full restaurant. (Old way of attracting customers)   2. Long wait for food. Another bad strategy to sell appetizers and drinks. (They are almost pushy when they tell you right up front)   3. Burgers are full of flavor, but not in a good way. Too much of one ingredient overpowers the taste of the main part, which should be the burger."}
{"text":"Had the egg burger and it was excellent. Also had the Oreo shake and it was great. I would eat here again. Probably top ten burgers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch after landing in Las Vegas. We all enjoyed the burgers and the wings appetizer.  I would have given this a 4 or even a 5 star rating, but I thought for the price they could have done better. For 14 bucks, they should have given us at least french fries."}
{"text":"I wasn't excited to get a burger here but have to say I was very impressed. Made to order and cooked perfectly. Great sauce for fries and beer menu was good."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for work and wound up dining alone at Burgr. From the minute I sat down, the experience was an amazing one. I couldn't decide between the many delicious sounding burger combinations, and asked for advice from my waiter- he didn't hesitate before giving me info on my different options. I ultimately decided on the chicken burger with blue cheese and spicy mayo and a blood orange martini. The drink arrived quickly and was the perfect amount of sweetness without being overpowering. I was sitting at the counter in front of the open kitchen and watched as all of the food was cooked and plated- as I watched, I couldn't help but wish I had ordered more than just a burger. I commented on this to the Chef de cuisine Christina, saying how delicious everything looked. No sooner did my burger arrive than I was treated to a sampling of all of the amazing looking sides I had been watching come out of the kitchen. Each one served with a different dipping sauce, the three different types of fries, onion rings and poppers did not disappoint- they tasted even better than they had looked! And my burger was also the right choice- while not as spicy as I had expected, the burger was perfectly moist and the toppings all came together well. Dining alone can be a bit daunting, but between the fantastic service and delicious food, Burgr made my day!"}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious. The fries are amazing. But what really got me....the wings! They were so delicious I regret not ordering more!"}
{"text":"Average.  Yes, it's the Strip. It's going to be expensive, and honestly, I don't mind paying a bit more for some \"flash\" and for the convenience. You're in Vegas! However, for the price and for the name attached to this spot, I think it's reasonable to have a bit higher expectations. And unfortunately, I was a bit underwhelmed by BurGR.  Both of our burgers were a bit overcooked (more-so than what we requested), meat lacked juiciness/flavor, bun wasn't anything special, and portions were small for the price. I'm a foodie, so I don't mind paying for quality in small portions...when it's good. And this was just average. Nice presentation, mediocre flavors. Perhaps I'm spoiled by living in the Midwest, but I've had much better burgers for less than half the price. We ate better for cheaper at every other spot during our recent trip to Vegas.  The tastiest thing we enjoyed was the order of onion rings we shared - delicious batter! Definitely recommend. Overall, though, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. It's okay - but you can do better for Vegas dining!"}
{"text":"I ordered the farm burger and it was tasty! Ordered the sweet potato fries with the sugar powdered vanilla and those were great too. Customer service was great as well. I would go back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Best burgers in towne.  Today I drove here for iver 300 miles to have my usual house burger and gooey fries but what a surprise..  fries are not longer in the menu.  Menu was changed not sure why, the best 2 things in the menu are gone!!   Some new things looked interesting.. other things confuse..  anyways.  Ill be looking for a new place gor when Im in Vegas"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 2 stars due to the service was good. The food was over rated over priced and I would not recommend this place to anyone. Had to wait over an hour with hungry kids. We ordered the onion rings which were great and the sweet potato fries were good. The truffle ff were horrible. They do not offer a kids menu so had to pay full price for something the kids would not finish and for that it is not a kid friendly restaurant.  The burgers were okay nothing out of the ordinary.  I think in n out or shake shack would have been a better choice and more reasonable priced."}
{"text":"We saw a really long line and wanted to try it out.. This place was a bit overrated and hyped. The wait was extremely long also.   Though the burger combinations sounded amazing, it really wasn't all that great.. Too many flavors clashed with each other. I would much rather go to Holstein's burgers. The truffle fries and onion rings were also way too oily..   Maybe I came on a bad day, but I just wasn't all that satisfied with it. I couldn't even finish my food.. And my boyfriend neither."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to get burgers anywhere! Service is usually pretty good, good and shakes are outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what all these people are raving about. Our order of onion rings and truffle fries was left untouched. Both were soaked in oil, I would not pay $2 for something like that. Soba noodles order was blah: poor presentation, too much sauce in noodles, super spicy chicken, huge order (can be easily shared for 2 or more). My husband's pork burger was good, but it was expected. Come for a burger and a beer, nothing else. I am pretty sure GR would not be happy with the quality of appetisers if he was given the food we got.  Our waiter was a super nice guy, very polite and even brought us a new order of fries with cheese and truffle oil on a side. It was marginally better than the first order of fries which was dripping oil after I slightly pressed on it. If you want good fries, go to Bouchon @ Venetian. If you are at PH and hungry, just check their sandwiches 20 steps away from GR restaurant."}
{"text":"I could not decide on 2 or 3 stars. However, Everything we experienced here was amazing, up until we got our food. Our server had left! We did not see her for 30 minutes, not even her other tables. It's sad because I was very impressed with her greeting, and her knowledge of the menu. You could tell she was into her job. However, In this line of work, first impressions are sometimes not as important as the last impression. Not sure If I will try another Gordan Ramsay restaurant.   Being in this industry myself, I couldn't help notice a few things: All the employees wear the same clothing head to toe (men are different from girls). Somewhat weird, I could never work there considering my shoe size! Of the 3 managers who were on duty (I only noticed this because of how over dressed they were to be flipping a hamburger) basically stood in the middle of the restaurant and monitored. (Too bad he missed us standing 6 feet in front of him) Lastly, what is the need for so many people working? I saw more dish/bus boys bussing tables than customers. I usually tip well, but being our server vanished, and the bus boys did her work, I was inclined to leave 5%, hopefully going to the bus boy."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 3.5, but I can't, so I went down to 3. I'd heard all kinds of good things about this place, so the wife and I decided to have dinner here. We had to wait in line to get in (there was no separet line for parties of 2 or less). When we got in, I saw empty tables. Hmm... So, the place was very loud, and the chairs are really low, causing the waiter to bend over and talk very loudly. If my back was acting up, I would not like those seats. My wife got a burger, and I got the pork burger. She liked hers, and mine was good, but I could barely even tell it was pork. In any case, both burgers were good. No sides come with the burgers. What's up with that? We had onion rings for an appetizer, and they were quite good, but a bit greasy. We ordered one side of fries to go with our burgers, and didn't finish them. Not very good. Drinks were pretty good. Service was pretty good, but not what you would expect from seeing Rameys's shows. People at the next table over were French, and had trouble ordering. Funny that BurGR has photos of all the desserts and drinks, but not of the entrees. The wife at that table got her burger long before her husband did, but the GM came by and said he was comping the man's burger. Not that he understood that... So, overall, the burgers are good, the rings are good but greasy, the fries are bad, and the place is overpriced and overrated. 2 burgers, 2 sides, 4 cocktails = over $100."}
{"text":"Wandered in after walking around drunkenly on the trip. Sat at the far. Amazing burgers for a fair price"}
{"text":"I give this place a solid 4 based on service and the food.  My friends and I came here right at 11am for their lunch (that's when it was open). We were able to walk right in with a very short line up. That's always awesome.   The food was amazing. We ordered a few things to share such as the farm burger, their daily special (forgot what it was called), fish sandwich, oreo and creme brulee milk shake and a truffles poutine. They were all really good. I would come back here anytime man. Though I think I need to majorly go work out. Probably gained a pound or two from this lunch. lol.  I give this place a solid 4 because their service wasn't up to the standard that I expected. I mean this place is from Gordon Ramsay. Our server had no smile and looked like she just wanted to get the out of their as soon as possible. Came back a few times hoping we would pay and leave (at least that's what it looked like on her face). We saw a handful a servers standing around on the side chit chatting with each other. So, ya wasn't exactly pleased with their service. But the food was awesome.  Overall I would come back for their food and only for the food."}
{"text":"A little pricey but what do you expect--you're on the Strip.  The food and service were excellent. If you find yourself there and not craving a burger, you'd do fine with the Soba Chicken Salad."}
{"text":"Great service I ordered the parmergon fries and the hells kitchen burger and the banana milkshake the butterscotch pudding was divine it was excellent definitely will go there again"}
{"text":"Every time when I take a trip to Vegas, it is a must to have a meal at Ramsay BurGR. Hell's Kitchen burger is my favorite. It is nothing like a typical burger that you get elsewhere. I also had the American burger and added bacon, delicious. If you want something different the Hell's Kitchen burger is the way to go. The burgers don't come with fries though, so I added some truffle fries to my order. The fries are really good as well."}
{"text":"Even with the plethora of options for a quality burger in Vegas, Gordon Ramsey BurGR proves itself as a top choice for me.   During my last trip to Vegas, I found myself in Henderson for the majority of my time, which only allowed for a few meals to enjoy on the strip. After going through what seemed like an endless list of burger options from classic and cheap to over-the-top decadent, I settled on this spot to satisfy my burger cravings. And it was exactly what I was looking for.  I went with the Hell's Kitchen Burger which came with asadero cheese, roasted jalepeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato. Coming in at $14, I found that the size and quality of the burger was on par with the price and a decent value for the amount of flavor that it packed. As expected from a place bearing Gordon Ramsey's name, the burger was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of heat from the peppers without overpowering the other elements. In fact, all of the elements of the burger complimented each other to create a deliciously tender bite. A very satisfying burger. The Chanterelle Burger came with a generous amount of chanterelle mushrooms on a fig and onion jam, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, especially when compared to the bold flavored Hell's Kitchen Burger. The beer battered Maui Onion Rings were cooked perfectly crispy and the chipotle ketchup was an interesting twist.   Although I saw a few interesting things on the menu that I would have liked to try (bao buns, jalapeno poppers, etc.), the star here is clearly their burgers. If you're looking for a high quality gourmet burger that's cooked right, but don't necessarily want to go the route of wagyu or some exotic blend, Gordon Ramsey BurGR will be sure to satisfy."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay and his restaurants and BurGR did not dissapoint! The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were delicious. Come early if you want a seat because there is always a wait!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, good service, my waiter was alex with the glasses, he was wonderful I recommend it to everyone especially if you love burgers!"}
{"text":"I always walk pass this restaurant when I was in Vegas a few months ago. I thought since it's Gordon Ramsey, it should be great. I was here a few days ago with my friend. She had a soba noodle chicken salad. She said it was really good. As for me, I got the farm burger. It was. ehhh. ok? It wasn't the best burger I had. The meat was really dry. My friend and I also got truffle fries which is big enough to share.. The truffle fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Big supporter of any Gordon Ramsey restaurants and this one included! Burger was cooked to perfection and flavors were on point- stomach literally just growled.  Great spot to satisfy that burger craving and gotta try the onion rings. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It was by far the fanciest burger place I had ever been to. The line was ginormous but I'm happy to say, it was worth the wait. The burgers were pricey, but that was to be expected before I even sat down. fries are not served with the burgers, you have to buy those separately, which one order can easily feed 2 or 3. The apple pork burger was unlike anything id ever tasted before.  Though I did not have the appetite to order them, the desserts on the menu looked great also.This place is great if you are looking for a unique and somewhat upscale dining experience. they even let you keep the menu as a souvenir."}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting LV for my birthday, and we decided to go to Burgr for dinner. The wait wasn't terrible - about 25-30 minutes, but was expected.   We were updated a few times during one wait as to a timeframe when we would be seated which was very appreciated.   The food was amazing. We started off with drinks and piggies in a blanket. I didn't know pigs in a blanket could taste so good. After tasting these, the pigs in a blanket I make taste like something I found at a gas station.   The waitress was friendly and quick to refill drinks. She answered all of the questions we had about the menu.   I ordered an Uber Burger and my wife ordered a Euro burger. They. were. Amazing. The burgers were cooked exactly how we asked and they tasted delicious.   I can't wait to go back here again!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 6:25pm and asked for a table for 4.  The hostess told us 30-35 min. Not bad around dinner time! The hostess said she would send us a text when our table was ready and we had 10 min to check back in. 40-45 min later we finally received the text and checked back in. The hostess told us they were getting our table set up and it would be just a few more minutes. Another 20 minutes later we finally got seated. So for that reason, I am being generous with the 3 star rating. Also, there was a line people were standing in and I am not sure what that was about, but it seemed to be for parties of 2 and they were getting seated a lot faster.   3 stars for food. Just okay. The Just Fries are nothing special. We also ordered the onion rings, which I would recommend over the fries. They came with different kinds of ketchup, which I didn't really like the taste and preferred eating both the fries and onion rings without the sauces. One order of fries was plenty to share between the 3 of us. I ordered the Chantanelle (sp?) burger which had mushrooms and an onion jam. I could not taste either the onions or the mushrooms and the burger was quite bland and dry. I don't think my burger had any mushrooms at all. Son ordered the American burger and gobbled it up. Husband ordered the Farm burger and gives it 4 stars.   I do give 5 stars for service. Quick, efficient, and refilled our drinks before we had to ask. Quick with the check, too.   I probably will not go here the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Guess what they intentionally let you stand in the freaking line even they do have space to make you feel degraded. The servers were standing there having fun chatting laughing like they are getting paid with anything but money. I had to leave without even getting in.   Too bad as it was one of the top ones to try on my LV trip list.   Not recommended for ones who has self esteem."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here!  Our server was very knowledgeable,  fast, and friendly.   The hell's kitchen burger was great, but the highlight was the oreo shake with creme brule on the top."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Vegas! Be sure to try the Hog burger, it's amazing. Best of all, the waitresses are HOT."}
{"text":"If you are a party of two there is a line for you to wait, but if you have a bigger group, they'll text you when your table is ready so you don't have to wait in line.     My friends and I all got one shake of different flavors.   I got the Crème Brulee pudding with oreos milkshake, it was the best one out of all them.   But, even with my sweet tooth, I couldn't handle all the sugar, it was straight up diabetes in a cup.       All their burgers are delish but it is very salty.   A fair warning.   This is definitely a man's meal, if you know what I mean, not for the faint in heart."}
{"text":"Excellent! We arrived and checked in at the front counter. For a party of six we were quoted between an hour and hour and fifteen minutes for a table. We were seated after an hour and seven minutes. The farm burger, American burger,onion rings, and sweet potato fries were all out of this world. The farm burger was topped with duck breast bacon, cheese, and a perfectly cooked over medium egg. The American burger was also delicious topped with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles. The onion rings were crispy and flavorful. The sweet potato fries were decandent and topped with powder sugar. Yum! The cocktails were flavorful and had a decent amount of alcohol.  Even though the food was AMAZING, our waitress Kaysea, made our experience even better. She was upbeat, personable, and attentive during our dining experience!  Gordon....prompt her to management!"}
{"text":"Caesar's is better than PHo. GR Pub is better than BurGR. These are just the facts of life.  If you are close close to the Planet Hollywood and hungry, don't hesitate to stop on in for a good burger.  However, if you are on a culinary journey in search of the best of the best and need something to check off in the Gordon Ramsay category, then trek on over to the Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill at Caesar's for a more premium experience.  Service = 5 stars Theming = 4.5 stars Drink selection & preparation = 4.5 stars Food = 3 stars  The burger was decent, but it probably doesn't make a Las Vegas top 5 burger list in my mind.  Skip the simply fries as they were simply too salty and I did not like the chipotle and curry ketchup at all.  This was sad because I was rather excited about them.    The poppers had a mystery 6th popper that left all the seeds in it and was supposedly much hotter.  Pretty fun in concept, but they could have just left the seeds in them all for me as I love the heat.  With all the cheese and ranch dipping (and libations), the hot one wasn't that much hotter and I might not have noticed a difference if they didn't hype it up.  Go ahead and get the poppers and some beers here and you will be extremely happy."}
{"text":"So excited to finally be eating at a Ramsay restaurant. Wait wasn't bad at all to get in. Love the iPad with the drinks menu, but wish it had prices on the mixed drinks. Onions rings were ok but will pass on them next time. I agree with people saying they are salty but the ranch is amazing. Now on to the good stuff...burgers. I got the über cheese and it was sooo good. Yes a little dry, BUT the goat cheese makes up for it. Husband got the Hell's Kitchen and he say spicy so be forewarned. Will come back again but to share a burger and get the bao puns as the guy next to me had them & they looked so good!"}
{"text":"Don't submit to the hype.  It was an overrated (literally) restaurant. I had the Farm Burger and Truffle Parmesan Fries. The burger was overly dry and bland. The fries were bland as well. Please salt the fries!  Go for the experience, but not the food. The burger at Guy Fieri at the Quad was a lot better."}
{"text":"A big disappointment....twice!    I am a big fan of Gordon's TV shows, so maybe I expected too much.  I found the burgers to be bland, the buns very dry.  The toppings were good.  The accouterments (fries, rings, etc.) were nothing special.  I wanted to give it 2.5, so you know.  For less money go to Ketchup Premium Burger Bar in Miracle mile.  Better food FAR better service.  Oh yea, the service is mediocre, just too busy for the number of staff."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice experience.  The burgers are cooked to perfection, and the onion rings were amazing.  It's a bit expensive, naturally, and the menu is a la carte.  Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food was aaamazing! I had the devil dawg and it was very everything I hoped it would be. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I recently tried Burgr for the first time in Las Vegas! It had definitely lived up to its hype. I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant, since I was super addicted to Gordon Ramsay's \"Hell's Kitchen's\" latest season. Usually, I am not much of a burger person, but I ordered the Farm Burger here & it was cooked to perfection! I like my meat cooked medium well & it was not over cooked and still very tender. The duck fat bacon was so delicious! Presentation was definitely a solid 10 here. The burger was presented beautifully and at the same time was delicious. We also ordered the truffle fries and omgosh, the truffle sauce was SOOO damn good. The fries were a little on the dryer side though. I think the fries were delicious, but not worth $11 in my opinion. Service was really good here. Our server was informative & nice :) Would definitely come back next time  go back to VEGAS !! :)"}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen burger had a nice bite to it with avocados balancing well. Bartender well informed and good with recommendations. Bartender was helpful, knew the food options well, and provided great service. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Went around New Year's,  great location and hours. Good looking menu, next time I'm trying the duck bacon burger. The truffle fries are delicious,  I enjoyed the aioli but not the ketchup.  My fiancée was first hesitant of the ketchup but at the end raved about it. I just got the regular burger and it was pretty good. I will go again on next visit.  Reason for three stars my waiter never checked on us until it was check time."}
{"text":"We had a great time.  I had hoped for a little better beer selection to go with the burgers, but I managed to find something I like.  I had the \"Gordon Burger\" which was on special and came with avocado and duck bacon.  It was quite good.  We ordered some sweet potato fries and some truffle fries.  The truffle fries could've been dialed back a notch, but they were good.  Sweet potato fries came with powdered sugar and some kind of non-descript Jello-pudding-looking sauce.  My wife had the Britannia burger, which she liked, though she did have to send it back to get the chutney that comes with it.  Sending back a dish at a Ramsay restaurant brought a smug satisfaction that money can't buy.  We all had a good laugh about it.  Our server was great, the food was great, the atmosphere was great.  The price was appropriate."}
{"text":"My favorite burger in Vegas, hands down! I just returned for a second helping and it was every bit as amazing as the first bite. I can tell that the place has gotten a lot of great press as the line is 10x the size it was on my first visit. Grab a seat at the bar or if you have a players card you might be able to get bumped up in the line. Service is amazing, craft beer list is surprisingly good and the top-notch meat is simply prepared, grilled over a wood fire and is paired perfectly with just two or three additional ingredients to add up to a near-perfect well-rounded combination. Do yourself a favor and order medium rare or medium at most. Try the truffle fries, the onion rings or the stuffed jalapenos. Sounds like some basic burger sides on the surface, but they'll likely be the best representations of each you've had in a long, long time."}
{"text":"I was here a few months back so I hope this isn't too outdated, I just lost track of time lol. For those who follow me... *Gluten free note*  I'm still surprised how little this is mentioned. Anyway, when I was there the menu was a bit confusing because it listed only 1 burger as gluten free, but the waiter was knowledgeable and pointed out that all of their burgers can be made gluten free upon request. Of course, keep away from obvious things (I'm looking at you crispy onions) but they do seem to have a better handle than most on this.  Gluten bias point: +.5 (I add this to the total averaged from the scores below!)   Food: 4 - everything was REALLY rich. It was like upscale bar food honestly, very Vegas-y Ambience: 3.5 - I'm torn on this, the really high bar stools didn't do it for me, nor did the upscale hooter girls. Sorry people, it's subjective lol Service: 4 - My waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and slow. Points knocked for the loudly gossiping hostesses/waitresses, they weren't friendly.  Price: 4 - not as bad as I thought it would be for the name  Ok so the long review :)   Food: Alright, so I really loved some of the upscale aspects like duck egg, duck bacon, gouda etc. Some of those small elements really pushed my score up. I was disappointed by how unbalanced the food tasted. Honestly, it was really greasy, really rich, and needed salt. I did love the cheesy fries with the duck egg, and the yolk kind of helped eat the super cheesy fries but I couldn't eat more than a couple bites. I had to get my burger protein-style of course, and I got the egg there too. Although the meat was cooked perfectly, and really moist, it didn't have very flavor on its own. I mean, basic salt and pepper yanno? It was ..just higher quality burger meat. I have to say Gordon's name really sets your expectations pretty high, so that's probably where the disappointment came in. But, I really like duck.   But I mean if you're looking to eat fattening, rich, and greasy bar-food with an upscale feel, this is your joint.   Ambience: I hated the high bar stools, so probably would do the table next time. The fire was definitely cool though. I had a hard time grading this, honestly, it's probably the detached girls that did it in for me but I tried to factor them more into the service than the ambience. I will say that the way they dress is fair game for \"ambience\" and you get the feel of a kind of upper-class hooters. I have no idea what they did though because there was like 6 girls at the front with 1 or 2 ever leaving and all they did was talk. It was really annoying. The vibe was a guy-vibe. I might get heat for this (bring on the insults about my insecurity and religion) but it just wasn't for me. I usually don't even mind bars/pubs that are clearly not trying to be anything other than a bar/pub but this place felt like it was both trying too hard and not hard enough lol  Service: My waiter was nice, cordial but nice. He was informed about gluten so I did like that. I really did not like the snobby feel I got from pretty much everyone there. It wasn't welcoming at all. The girls at the front were loudly gossiping, they hardly acknowledged us, and it's very anti-feminist of me to say but it really felt like they expected their looks to do all the talking. I wanted a smile, a welcome, something kind lol   Price: Honestly, I expected to pay more. I think what makes this expensive is because they're not \"meals\" like everything is separate, which is kind of genius honestly. So you price the burger at around $15 but make them buy everything else on the side haha. I was both impressed and annoyed that I fell for it. No, but really, aside from my greasy/rich/fatty complaint, the food really was different enough to warrant the price. I really like duck too."}
{"text":"I love this place. We go here every time we're in Vegas. And I look forward to it.  The food is fantastic and service  is great as well. Unlike other Gordon Ramsay  restaurants   this place is affordable  for everyone. Around  $20 per person  for a burger and fries and the food is top notch. Seriously, Definitely eat here when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"We were at miracle mile shopping bc the mall attached to the Aria is so ridiculous ($$$$) and decided to \"grab a bite\". Its so amazing but the burger was only pretty good. I've had angus ground that was more flavorful. The HOTDOGS were fantastic!!!!  Way better then PINKS outside planet hollywood which is famous for their hotdogs. The sweet potato fries with ketchup instead of that weird sauce that comes with it were gobbled up and fought over. We had reservations at le cirque, sage, nobu, tao, but this was our favorite and that's why we blew off lunch at bouchon to come here AGAIN! This time we had the jalapeno poppers which were INSANE, and hubby had a shake... which was ridiculous (its like pudding in a glass). British thing?? Overall the burger was very good but didnt compare to the insane hotdogs and fries. Everything was really high quality and i have to get that ketchup recipe!! ***Once in line they will take down your info and text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"I'm beginning to wonder whether Gordon Ramsay is just a fictitious, overly confident chef. Having tried out several of his restaurants now, I'm really just not that impressed with anything he's put out. His concepts are just too over the top, trying way too hard.  I guess this time it's with an Asian influence e.g. honey-pig bao buns (translation: bun buns?), soba noodle chicken salad, etc. Except... the servers are all wearing this shiny pewter/charcoal grey spandex-type dress and bowling shoes?   The burgers are mounds high, piled with condiments and requiring knife and fork. The hotdogs were visually appealing. We tried the Pork Belly Dawg and it wasn't bad - but the pork belly and sauce added on top of the hotdog made everything super salty. I like how they used a gourmet sesame bun though instead of the usual cheap-ass stuff. It made a big difference in the texture - no dry and loose crumbs all over the place.  However, the truffle parmesan fries were seriously delicious! Another salt-heavy item but the fries were crispy, the cheese was pungent and drool-inducing, and the truffle oil just made you want to keep eating 'em!   I was most impressed with dessert (and to think, I almost passed it up because I was unimpressed with the hotdog). Just try to NOT salivate over this: sticky toffee pudding with salted peanut caramel ice cream PUSH POPS!   Riiiiiight?! I haven't had a push pop in a loooong time (Flintstones anyone?). Dang these were crazy yummy with the toffee pudding at just the right amount of sweetness so that the salted peanut caramel ice cream carried most of the flavor. It was gooey but not  to the point where you had to pick it off your teeth. All the flavors just blended together for this amazing peanut buttery taste. I just want to go back for this!  bottom line: gets a good vote for a hangover meal contender, but expect to pay $$."}
{"text":"I cannot believe anyone would ever give this place a positive review.  The service was absolutely terrible!  Promised no more than a 45 minute wait time and at 45 minutes were told that we had another 45 minutes?    Finally sat and ordered our burgers.  They were dry and flavorless...  The only thing saving this from a zero rating were the truffle fries....  Outstanding for sure...    Do yourself a favor - there are plenty of other burger places far superior..."}
{"text":"Stopped in here Thursday night and ate at the bar. Started off with the sknny screw - was declious.  Then the highlight of our night - THE BURGERS. AMAZING! No joke - the best burger I ever had. I wish I could get another one right now, but I will have to wait for my next trip out there for it!  Then there was the sweet potato fries (WITH POWDERED SUGAR) Omg- to die for!  We just loved them!  Only reason they got 4 stars was because it took 32 minutes for our food to come out.  I know there were busy, but its vegas - they should have those kinks worked out to keep things running smoothly on busy Thursday evening.  Overall - I def recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and did not get a chance to eat right away but the food was darn tasty even lukewarm. The Jalapeño Poppers were spicy as the seeds were not removed so watch out for that. The Truffle Parmesan fries did not disappoint. This side can easily be shared by two people. Also tried the Farm Burger medium well and Chili Hot Dog. The burger tasted better than the average burger and the hot dog stood out. The sausage was huge, no pun intended. I had to share it as I couldn't finish it myself. I'd recommend to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Great service and great burger! I tried the hell's kitchen burger. It has the spicy kick to it which I love. I'm gonna stop here again when I visit Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend on Sunday, (Memorial weekend), was told it was going to be a 40 min wait which I expected. Walked around planet Hollywood for only 15 min and got the text that our table was ready! The decor is interesting, they have a cute little bar as well. Okay on to the food, my friend got the creme brulee shake, it was really creamy/tasty but soooo rich! We shared the Parmesan onion rings, they were awesome! They were crispy and light, and had a generous amount of Parmesan on top. I also loved the cheddar ranch that came with it. We both ordered the farm burger which had English cheddar cheese, fried egg, and duck breast bacon on it. It was a pretty good burger, good enough for 14$? I don't know... Overall I had a good experience and would come back to try another burger and get those onion rings again."}
{"text":"It took over 30 minutes to be served a mediocre Farm Burger. Very disappointed I service and food quality. Had a better burger on the strip in some dive. !"}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends so we sampled a lot of different items. The toppings were different and not something I would normally add but I'm glad I tried. That being said, I didn't think the actual flavor in the patty was all that great. Especially with burger places being all the rage I guess I expected a little more. That being said it was a neat experience."}
{"text":"All that you read about the burgers being bland- its true..  you get a very bland burger for $15.  it does not come with fries. Fries or any sides start at $8.  If you want to still stop by just to say you've been here, go ahead and waste $50 for two (and thats that we only ordered 1 non-alcoholic drink).  I can tell you that The Habit you will only pay $22 for 2 burgers and two sodas and two fries. When i told the server (whose attitude was just as bland as the burger) that the burgers did not meet my expectations, she let us have the sweet potato fries free ($8).  ok that was good but doesn't make up for the tasteless burgers.  Sorry not sorry GR but someone needs to do a makeover Hells kitchen show in your kitchen... Plus you know that long line you have to make before coming into the restaurant???  Ya its unnecessary... i saw there were about 8 open tables we waited our 25 min at our seats for our burgers.  The line outside was probably 30 people long.  be smart. save your money. don't eat here"}
{"text":"Initial Wait: we checked in for 5 at 7pm on Saturday. Quoted wait time was 1 hour so we weren't upset considering. We waited and then received a text saying to go to the from desk just to wait another 20 minutes because they said they were behind.   At the table: service was quick to begin with, but once we ordered we then had to wait another hour before our food came out. We noticed that about 5 tables had sat down after us and all received food before us. Therefor we have to question, what went wrong with our order? A little annoyed but our waitress was alert on the drinks.   Food quality: food was sub par. Mostly hyped up. We all tried something different and I have to admit. It's just another burger. Nothing rally makes it stand out. However, the fries, were DELICIOUS. Ordered the Parmesan truffle fries and they were amazing.   I suggest going for a experience, but other than that, avoid."}
{"text":"In a word... Flawless. As (somewhat) expected, BurGr delivered. EuroBurger was delivered hot, cooked to a perfect medium. Sweet bun toasted expertly. Didn't have a ton of time - Service was excellent at the bar (Mark). Will be back - Sweet Jesus, that was tasty... I feel like a should go back to the room and pray.   Gobs of tap beer also... Spectacular! Funny story: the staff wear Gordon Ramsay bedazzled bluejeans... Ha!"}
{"text":"If you are in the Las Vegas area and are feeling a burger n fries dont fight it go here. It's the best burger place I have ever been. It's happiness in a burger, I didn't think I could feel this way. Sounds corny I know but just wait till you experience this yourself. I had the Chantelle burger with arugula and it was beyond amazing. My boyfriend shared his truffle parmesain fries and it was delicious. I died inside a little bit after I realized I finish my burger. I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsey, but this place was a complete disappointment and I'm surprised he attaches his name to it.  We were a party of 6, and none of us was really satisfied.  The burger came out almost cold. The flavors were NOT packed at all (I tried two different burgers). Truffle parm fries were NOT anything special. I would prefer the habit, five guys, stout, even in n out over this... Yikes.  It was below mediocre and to think that we waited an hour for this?? Insane.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"4 of our party arrived in advance to get a table. The hostesses would not seat them until our entire party was physically in the restaurant. They explained our 86 year old grandma and I were taking our time to get there in the heat. The hostesses were too busy preening themselves to deliver good customer service. When they were pressed to do so, they recited restaurant policies, at least as they saw them. Finally our party spoke to Nathan, a server. He seated us and accommodated us. He was awesome. The burger I had, was the euro burger. It had goat cheese which was quite salty. However I found the burger it's self was good otherwise."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com. My husband and I came here after hitting up bacchanal buffet so we were pretty full. But I made it a mission to try this place mainly because I love watching him on food network and the show with the little kids chefs. So we came here to split a burger, I think it was called hells burger. My goodness it was juicy and flavorful. And by flavorful I mean you taste every single ingredient in the burger. One bite and you taste the tender juicy meat, the avocado which cools down the spice and adds a creamy texture, the chili spice factor of the pepper, earthiness of the greens, the smell in the perfection of the bread buns, and whatever sauce they put in the burger. Maybe it's pregnancy hormones but this is the best burger I've ever had in my life. My husband also ordered a shake which had cream brûlée and Oreo. Weird mix but the best shake I've ever had in my life. I love all ice cream shakes in the world but this shake is so good it makes me want to cry craving it right now. Humm... Is it too evil to make my husband fly to Vegas with me for a burger meal right now. Anyways I definitely recommend this place, it has to be a mandatory life bucket list sorta thing."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever ate for sure! It's was so good, the meat, the bread and even the friez was awesome. It's not that expensive and very friendly to every one  The hosts are great and very kind. The service was awesome and also the serving was fast and good. Great people, great food and very recommended to anyone!"}
{"text":"So after hearing good things about this place, coupled with good reviews on yelp my girlfriend and I decided to try this place out.   We arrived about 9:45 PM on a Thursday night and were told the wait was around 30mins, which was no big deal. It took about an hour to be seated though, but still not that big of a deal. Our real problem started once we sat down.   So we were promptly seated and our drink order was taken about five minutes later. We then proceeded to order our food. Two burgers and a side of fries. 45 minutes go by, well maybe it's because they are busy? I ask myself. Waitress comes back to our table and says that our \"ticket\" was lost and they can't find our order. So she has to once again take our order and send it back to the kitchen. In a perfect world, we would be placed in front of those that ordered after us you would think? Not the case. As all the others who came in 20-30 mins after us began to get there food before us, it was kind of annoying. So there we were waiting another 45 minutes to receive our food. After almost two hours in the restaurant, we finally got our meals.   I ordered my burger medium to be on the safe side. However it was pretty much bleeding out all over my plate. We quickly ate and left with little to no interaction with any wait staff thereafter. We were told the manager was \"aware\" but didn't come to apologize or anything.   All in all, it was a terrible experience eating at Burgr and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. I'm sure it could be a one time thing, but first impressions are highly important.   Ultimately I ended up getting really sick later that night from the food. I hadn't eaten anything else prior, so that was the only culprit."}
{"text":"Quick 15 minute wait during lunch hour, was seated quickly :)  I am a huge chicken wing fan and have been on the look out for the best wings. I think my search is over...... I started with the Fury Chicken wings - holy sshit amazing.  The presentation alone was perfection with the shaved carrots and blue cheese crumbles on top.   My boyfriend and I split the truffel burger. We subbed out the goat cheese for blue.... omg heaven in your mouth."}
{"text":"I wasn't about to leave Las Vegas without eating at at least ONE celebrity chef's restaurant, and BurGR was one of the less bank-breaking options.  We went in for lunch and, unsurprisingly, the line was quite long. BurGR takes the casual-dining concept of queuing (a short-distance pager) to a much more modern conclusion: they'll text you when your table is ready. After about ten minutes of wandering around the Planet Hollywood Casino where BurGR is housed, our table was ready and we were led inside.  The interior is classic American burger-bar: sleek metal, shiny white countertops, and the menus feature a flabbergasting Gordon Ramsey foldout.   The menu offers a wide range of burgers (and other non-burger offerings, but they are totally besides the point), from the traditional American (American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion) to the Farm Burger (duck bacon, cheddar, fried egg) to the Euro Burger (goat cheese, truffle aioli, arugula, and an oven-roasted tomato). I went with the Euro Burger and it was certainly one of the best burgers I've had. Wonderfully savory, with each part of the burger complimenting the rest, while one ingredient could easily have over-powered the others. The side of truffle fries (hand cut fries covered with truffle salt and truffle-parmesan shavings, with a truffle aioli dipping sauce) were delicious to the point of addictive.  It's not a cheap meal, by any stretch, but you ARE on the Strip eating at a restaurant operated by Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn trying to start this review. The burgers were good but not the best that I've had. BurGR is located inside Planet Hollywood and is very easy to find. There's a big sign on the right of the two main doors and there are flames lighting up the restaurant's sign as soon as you walk in.  Hell's Kitchen Burger (~$16) - Good. I love jalapeños and avocado so you can't really go wrong if you put these two items in my burger. But this burger was just an above-average burger. Maybe if I had this before I went to Seattle, I would think otherwise.   Truffle Aioli Burger (~$21) - Good. I had high, high expectations for this burger but I was let down. The bun was toasted perfectly and the patty perfectly cooked as requested but the flavor was just not perfectly put together.   Truffle Parmesan Fries - Yumm. I love the aioli sauce that it came with.  Gooey Fries? - Whatever it's called, it was ok. Had cheese, gravy, bacon bits and a fried egg on top. The fries got soggy real quick with all that on top.    4 stars because it really is good, I'm just a burger snob now :(  Service was amazing although it did take a while for our burgers to arrive. I think 30-45 minutes is much too long of a wait when there are empty tables around.  Will I come back? Nah, I'm moving on to the next burger joint in hopes of finding one as great as the one in Seattle :P"}
{"text":"What a joy!   Did not plan on eating in, but once we \"bumped into the place...\" Hostess was tired..   Cassy - our server was wonderful! Got in at 11.20-perfect time to avoid the loooong lines following . Burgers were all amazing! Buns-excellent and meat - perfectly medium! We had the avocado, the onion fig and the jalapeño ones. Then.....  the chocolate coffee hazelnut desert - one of a kind! Returned the next day for the desert only as our breakfast. Just Do!!"}
{"text":"Yay, another Ramsay restaurant off my list.  Kind of a bummer that they don't take reservations.  Came for lunch on a Friday and the line was huge.  They were taking the large groups out of line and texting them when their table was ready.  We only had a party of two and they told us it would be about 30 minutes but luckily we only had to wait for about ten.  The beer and drink list was surprising good.  The server gives you an I-Pad which is nice because it means the beer list is always up to date.  We shared the truffle fries and they two of us couldn't even finish them, they were pretty large.  I had the Uber Cheese Burger and it was delicious!  My husband loved his burger as well, I think it was called the Farm Burger or something and it had yummy smoked duck bacon.  You may think the prices are a little high for a burger but they are totally worth it."}
{"text":"Have become a big fan of Gordon Ramsay over the past couple years and he's inspired me to cook more at home and branch out in what I do cook.  So I told myself the next time I was in town I would definitely drop by one of his restaurants and try it out.    I went on a Tuesday night, and there was still a small line outside the restaurant when I came inside PH, however I didn't have to wait too long as the hostess quickly sat everyone ahead of me.  I was in town on business alone so I sat up at the bar near the kitchen and watched the parade of burgers, dogs, and fries leave.  The wait staff was quite friendly and I couldn't help but notice how tight the uniforms were.  I did think that was kind of odd for the type of restaurant it was, but maybe that's just me.  I ordered the Britannia Burger and sweet potato fries.  The burger was topped with extra sharp cheddar, a little mango salsa, and some arugula.  While I waited on my food I found it very interesting to watch the cooks go about their business plating the burgers or fries and the occasional hot dog or salad that came out of the kitchen.  I couldn't help but picture Chef Ramsay standing their barking at them as he does in many of his shows on TV.    The wait staff was very attentive and kept checking on me while my food was being cooked.  The wait wasn't too long and the burger was cooked to perfection.  I could really taste the sharp cheddar and just the hint of sweetness from the mangoes.  The fries came with a jalapeno/mayo dipping sauce and dusted lightly in powdered sugar.  The sauce had just a hint of the jalapeno flavor and a little burn at the end, but nothing that was over powering.  Fries were all nice and crispy and cooked well.  Price of course was a little higher than average, but when you're in Vegas on the strip, you have to expect it.  But overall I really enjoyed my experience and look forward to making a return trip the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"perhaps the best burger ive ever had in my entire life! i had the Euro Burger which had truffle aïoli, goat cheese, arugula, oven roasted tomato. the goat cheese was awesome! the onion rings wit chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip was deeelish! the sweet potato fries were sooooooo good that i couldnt stop eatin them! the fury chicken wings were good too! service was also fantastic cuz our waiter had a great sense of humor! we did have to wait for at least 30min before we got seated on a sunday night but it was definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We went in June 2015 (and not just because I secretly pretend Ramsay is my boyfriend). It's busy, you will have to wait in line for a table, but you can always be a nerd and take a picture with his poster outside the restaurant while in line like I did:-) Once you get seated, have a look around - nifty and pretty nice for a burger place.    Servers are gorgeous and lovely and somehow manage to take great care of you no matter how busy they are.  The fries -  Truffle Parmesan Fries (hand cut potatoes, truffle Parmesan, truffle salt & truffle oil) - $11. They were insanely good and the portion was easily large enough for the two of us to share.  The burgers -  Hell's Kitchen Burger (Asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno, avocado & roasted tomato) - $15 Euro Burger (truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, roasted tomato) - $15 Both were made with ridiculously good cuts of freshly ground meat and we still say they were about the best burgers we've ever had.       The price -  Ok, I realize not everyone wants to pay $25 for a burger and fries, but if you're in the neighbourhood, do it.    It's one of those bucket list things and it's probably the only Gordon Ramsay restaurant you can possibly afford.   LOL"}
{"text":"Its pretty bad when you leave a fancy burger spot such as this saying \"In-N-Out woulda been a better choice.\"  The Boyfriends Review: \"Quality ingredients, okay service, didn't like the taste, very very expensive\"  I agree with him, the little Sweetie.  Yelp did us dirty on this one! I trust Yelp with EVERY food choice so I ran to visit Gordon Ramsey and I'm unhappy I did. The service was dumb. The staff all acted like elite members of Vegas and there were a lot of employees standing around chatting as we sat with empty drinks for 7 minutes.  We ordered our burger \"medium\" and when we cut into it blood grease and bright pink meat appeared. It was so gross. It was clearly rare. When we asked for it to be remade the server told us that was their version of medium. No. Just say sorry and take it back. Don't make up nonsense. Or Tell Gordon not to redefine the definition of medium.   The onion rings and fries were highly recommended on Yelp so we ordered both- both super super greasy. The sauces that came with both were just blah. Nothing special about them even though Yelpers said they were great.   It was just really disappointing planning a fun dinner at an upscale restaurant then having it all kinda fall flat to the expectations. If I'm gonna pay $5 for one bottle of soda or $17 for a burger I want my socks knocked off!!"}
{"text":"The best burger I have had in a long time. The Hells Kitchen burger was awesome. It had a hatch chile instead of Jalapeño as the menu suggested - a much better choice in opinion.  My son loved his hog burger and the truffle fries are worth it too."}
{"text":"Was curious to see how this place is since we always passed by it when going to Vegas.  The food was actually pretty good. The burgers were delicious, not the best that I've had, but pretty good none the less.  The shakes though were soooo good!. One of the bests that I had! I ordered the Oreo Shake with Creme brûlée pudding and I couldn't put it down till it was done.  Service was pretty good. No real complaints.  Would recommend to try if you want a place with good burgers, good atmosphere and not too pricy either!"}
{"text":"My salad was amazing however I thought my waitress could have put in a little more effort with checking in on us."}
{"text":"Worth the wait.  My mushroom burger was amazingly good and the truffle fries were everything.  The fries are separate but filling and enough to share.    Also, my antioxidant berry drink gave me a fantastic buzz."}
{"text":"The food was good but overpriced for what you get(small portions). I would recommend the farm burger. The service was okish and the wait time was super long. The only reason I didn't put two stars on it was because the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Please note that the five-star review takes into account rating it for what it is:  a burger joint.  No, it's not a 5-star culinary experience, but they do serve an outstanding burger.  Had burgers, sweet potato fries & drinks and could not have been happier.  This is one of those rare times I would say I would gladly pay them $15 for a burger any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest if Gordan Ramseys' name wasn't a part of this place it would just be a burger place. The burgers are decent at best but not for the cost.  Truffle fries are the best of the options, but again not for the price. You are going to have to wait about an hour but they will text you so you don't have to wonder around close by with the light up spaceship hockey puck thing. If you want to say you had food at a celebrity restaurant go for it, but don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Time to finish up this review...LOL..Came here on opening day and the wait wasn't so bad. The hostess checks us in on an iPad and texts us when our table is ready. The whole service experience was so welcoming, professional and friendly.  But lets get to the important part! The food :) I ordered the Hells kitchen burger; Full of flavor with a spicy kick...I found my new favorite burger! I come to Vegas every other weekend and stop by here when it's not so packed =)"}
{"text":"Top notch. Worth the wait. The hog burger and farm burger were succulent and flavorful, loved the truffle fries too. Cocktails were amazing as well. I just wish we would have saved room for dessert. Love the ambiance too."}
{"text":"My 1st meal in Vegas was here. The restaurant was much larger and spacious inside than it appeared to be in the outside. The seating system was a little slow.  The menu was pretty much burgers and not much else as the name implies. There was a good variety of various burgers with a good number of b topping options to try. My burger was good, but nothing to write home about. I wasn't too happy that there was a limited number of side options to go with the meal.  Also, I found there were very few healthy eating options and veggie choices.  I loved the ambiance of the restaurant but found. The food choices limited. This place is somewhere casual to check out, but nowhere I would have to frequent when in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had really amazing service, and the food. Damn. Jalapeño poppers served in little shot glasses with some delicious something. My burger-forgot the name but I has a picture. Was really good. Really filling and then we had the push pops dessert things and oh man!  Had I not been so stuffed I could have probably ate another. This place was great. Don't forget to make reservations!!!! Waiting sucks!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan and I was so excited to finally eat at one of his restaurants. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed at all. Everything I had from the draft beer to the appetizers to the actual burger was amazing!  I went here with a friend and we both recommend ordering the following items: 1) Chanterelle burger I ordered this and it was delicious. The beef was moist and juicy. The flavors really came together. I am also decently lactose intolerant so if you are like me and can't eat dairy products, this is the perfect burger for you! 2) Farm burger This is their most popular burger and my roommate loved it! She couldn't stop raving about how good it was.  3) Honey Pig Bao Buns These were some of the best bao buns I have had. The pork is so tender!   Overall, I will definitely be back! I am a burger and beer type of gal so this is the perfect place for me. Their draft beer selection is really good as well. The price is great too! I don't think $15 dollars for a burger is extremely overpriced. Being from San Diego, many bars and pubs charge around that price, so I was actually surprised these burgers weren't more expensive especially because it is Vegas. You need to come here!"}
{"text":"Meeting my friend Timmae and Helen from Minnesota for lunch! They really wanted to try this place out so here we are!  This time I tried their regular cheese burger, American Burger + Jalapeños. They added roasted jalapeños right on top of the burger and they were deliciously spicy! The burger was also cooked a perfect medium, pink throughout and the bun was tasty as well!  Also tried out their Jalapeño poppers. I liked the presentation, each popper is served in it's own individual shot glass with the spicy dip. These bad boys were nice n' spicy too! Loved them!  And for dessert, the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops come two per order so we shares. The Salted Peanut Ice Cream was really glodt, but the actually sticky toffee pudding wasn't that great. I'd stick to the original Sticky Toffee Pudding Dessert and the steak house.   3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"Amazing beer selection along with excellent burgers it doesn't get any better than that!  I stopped by BurGR on a Friday night and the place was packed but staff was friendly and very attentive although it seemed as if they had memorized a script they all were professional and gave excellent service which is pretty much expected coming from a Gordon Ramsey establishment.   As for the food burger selection was simple and delicious also cooked perfectly. Prices were fair especially being in Las Vegas. Overall I was satisfied and will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch yesterday around 12:00pm. There was a 30 min wait for a table of four so it wasn't terribly long. The hostess was very nice and helped us put our name down as well as explained the process.   Our server was Guy. He was down to earth and easy to talk to. He wasn't a typical server who is nice and does the minimum of their job. He truly engages with you in conversation, makes you feel at home, and also makes great recommendations for food.   Gooey Fries - This was good but I would have preferred some crunch in there. It was steak cut fries smothered in all types of cheeses, salami, and a fried egg. The fries were pretty mushy so everything melded together in one texture. I think if the fries were crispy or if they did a thinner cut of fries, it would have been that much better. Still great flavor though!   Hells Kitchen Burger - If you are a GR fan, you gotta get this right? I mean it is named after his show! This was definitely spicy because the roasted jalapeños were still seeded.   American Burger (w truffle aioli, crispy onions, and a fried egg) - I added additions to this burger and the truffle really topped it off. Overall, great juicy burger.   Truffle Burger - This isn't for me but if you're a truffle/foie gras lover, get this! The truffle was amazing and you can really taste the foie gras creme.   Gordon Ramsay did not disappoint. This is our second time at one of his restaurants and we were very happy with the food. We must try his steakhouse next!"}
{"text":"Everything is overpriced. The burger itself tasted bland, nothing really special. For 14 dollars I would have at least expected the meat to be flavored. The fries were good. Soda's are 4 dollars!!!  Strip Burger/ Smash Burger... Burger Bar... All better places and cheaper to.  Not worth the time or money."}
{"text":"The burgers at this joint is very good but I would say bachi burger is alittle better.  The meat is very juicy and cook to perfection.  Gordon Ramsey sure know how to make a very good burger."}
{"text":"The food & service was terrific! Chef Ramsey has set the bar for every burger joint. I love how at the end of the meal you can rate everything with an iphone that they give you with your bill. By far the best burger spot!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was way too spicy and the meat was not at all flavorful or contain any distinguishing spice or .... FLAVOR. I had to add a ton of salt to make it taste relatively edible. The fries looked nice, but they too, were bland. Shake # 4 is delicious- then the custard messes it all up. The service was polite and friendly, but the food was lacking. May I also add that the funky ketchups are way too ambitious at being funky. It just tastes weird. I see people standing in lines to come here and I feel sad for them. :("}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint. Medium Rare burger cooked perfectly along with the truffle fries and a shake!  Split it all with my date and it made for the perfect late night bite."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of gourmet burgers. Call me snobby, but there's just something indescribable about eating a fantastic piece of meat that's been crafted to perfection with the perfect toppings.  The food at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is ethereal. The truffle parmesan fries were fantastic, and the onion rings are the best I've ever had. The sweet potato fries had some unique touches to it, but there's only so much you can do with sweet potato fries.   You know a burger place is somewhat good if you can order the meat medium-rare--which I would recommend here. I ordered the Chanterelle Burger, which came topped with Chanterelle mushrooms, figgy-onion jam, and arugula. The meat was packed with so much flavor by itself, that I could have just eaten that. But together, it was one of the top 3 best burgers I've ever had.  Pricing is where it gets a little tricky. Mine was one of the more expensive burgers ($16), but there were plenty that were as low as $14. Although I never think burgers should be more than about $14 if they don't come with fries, I acknowledge that this restaurant is in a Las Vegas casino and expect them to charge a little more, which is okay. The only bad part is if you DO wish to order fries or onion rings, they're asking you to pitch in an extra $9-$11. Yikes!  But if you're on a budget and want to splurge for a meal, this would be a good place to do it since it's not crazy expensive. Or if you're with your partner, you could even split a burger and some onion rings and it won't cost as much (obviously I highly recommend the onion rings)."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch and was seating immediately at the full service bar. The staff was friendly and quick to help.  The most exceptional aspect to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR's food wasn't the flavor but it's incredible lack of any flavor. The burger I had was cooked medium rare, just like I asked. Can't blame the cooks for that. Topped with arugula, a roasted tomato and a truffle aioli.  The burger patty had absolutely no flavor. I'm not sure it had any spices added to the meat. It tasted like a patty you'd find at a cheap roadside diner. Gray and greasy.  The tomato was so soft and bland I questioned why it was even there. The arugula I can't say anything either way about, after all it's just arugula. However, I did love the truffle aioli. It was the only thing that was positive about the burger.  I also ordered the \"just fries.\" And that's exactly what they were. Just fries. They were served with a chipotle ketchup and a curry ketchup. The chipotle ketchup was alright. Seemed like a weird thing to try and make the place nicer with ketchup when the food itself was so bland. The curry ketchup just was so out of place. I'm not opposed to having Indian influences in an American restaurant like this, but being the only Indian influence it was just out of place.   If you go here, know you're paying for the name and not the food. I won't be returning to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR anytime soon."}
{"text":"Really slow coming out on a Monday night. Fries lacked flavor. Burgers were good but not worth the price wait or headache."}
{"text":"As a disclaimer, I want to say that I love watching Gordon Ramsay's shows, such as masterchef and Hell's Kitchen. I have always wanted to eat at one of his restaurants just to try his food. That said, I think if it was bad food, my husband would've thought so too as he is not much of a Gordon Ramsay fan..  We both loved it, I got the farmer burger and he got the Hell's Kitchen burger. I have never had a better burger in my life, and we go out to eat a lot at nice restaurants. The fries were thicker, which wasn't bad as they were still crispy..I can't stand soft fries. The ketchup was great (two varieties, curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup) and my favorite part was the dessert, which was sticky toffee pudding in a push pop form, kinda weird, but it was still delicious. The line went relatively quickly as well even though it was a long line to begin with. We waited less than 30 mins and there were at least 30 people in front of us. The two person table was quite small though but everything else was great: food, wait time, hostess, server, atmosphere..I'd give it 5 starts across the board. Great restaurant that lives up to the Gordon Ramsay name. The two of us spent about $70 which is moderately priced for a vegas restaurant, and so worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"On our last visit to Las Vegas my wife and I ate here twice.  Since we were a party of two, we had to wait in that line that's in front of the restaurant - the wait wasn't too bad, we waited 30 minutes at 9pm.  We got seated and the server was informative and welcoming. The menu is cleverly folded and the decor is nice.  Roasted Jalapeno Poppers - These were probably the best poppers I've ever had. They're on the spicier side but the filling, sauce, breading are all awesome.  Parmesan Truffle Fries - The aioli they serve it with is amazing, be sure to ask for extra. The fries are alright - because they're steak fries you get a lot of potato with every bite. Not a huge steak fry fan.  Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings - Absolutely amazing - my favorite onion rings (like them more than Phil's BBQ in SD)  Fury Chicken Wings - Sweet and spicy wings - more on the sweet side. Very tender and moist with the outside skin perfectly crispy.  Euro Burger w/duck bacon - This burger was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and all the toppings complimented each other. Easily my favorite burger.  Hell's Kitchen Burger - This burger was pretty awesome.  Farm Burger - It was alright. Get the Euro or Hell's.  Shake #4 crème brûlée pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie Shake #5 chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake + praline cookie   - The shakes were incredible. Pudding with your shake? Best idea ever!   I've had my fair share of burgers over the years everything from Rustic Canyon Burger @ Rustic Canyon, the Rossini @ Burger Bar, Umami, Father's Office Burger, all the usual suspects for best burger around. Gordon Ramsay - you just took burgers to the next level. The Euro burger is my absolute favorite burger of all time. I only wish I could get it here in LA. Everything at the restaurant tasted amazing!  tl:dr Euro Burger - the best Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings - the best Truffle Aioli - the best (on everything) Roasted Jalapeno Poppers - the best Shakes - the best"}
{"text":"I have had plenty of burgers in my life and this is definitely up there if not already the best. They are open really late so this place is a good pick me up. And even though it has Gordon Ramsay on it, this place is not formal. Which is a good thing so you do not have to bother getting all dolled up. The price is obviously more expensive than your fast food burger, but I promise you that it will not break the bank.  Overall, if you love burgers and find yourself in Las Vegas, give this joint a try!"}
{"text":"Ramsay totally disappoints!   I've been to one of his restaurants in LA and was expecting great things, but my expectations were apparently too high. decided to give Ramsay here another chance and tried his burger place in vegas...as its not too difficult to mess up a burger.  we walked through the casino but entrance was only from the front.  a lot of empty tables already set up were available.  when we went up to the host, we had to wait 10 minutes for them to set up tables....we were alll so confused.  are they making us wait just for the hek of it?!  we got -truffle fries: my first bite of this fried potato was sooooooooooooo dry! liked the truffle flavor and generous shavings of parmesan on top but that did not help.   -chanterelle burger: got my meat medium, which did turn out medium.  it was not a thick piece of patty, but it was NOT moist and delicious.  Meat was under seasoned!!!  figgy-onion jam was decent.  really liked the caramelized onions but needed more figs.  its a hard balance since caramelized onions are already so sweet!   the bun was probably the best thing, besides the arugula out from a bag.....but bun was soft and had pretty white and black sesames dusted on top. -friends got hell's kitchen burger and bleu burger.  hell's kitchen burger was okay due to the avocado and jalapeno.  bleu burger was so dry, friend didnt even find effort to finish it.   service followed the confusing sevice from host's station.  we had to constantly remind her of more water and instead of filling everyones' glass, she did it one at a time when we asked.  my friends clearly had empty water glasses but she just filled mine to the rim and left......we sat right next to the water container too.  do not think a poor burger is worth $14-15!! ramsay disappointed again and I probably will not try any of his other many restaurants."}
{"text":"I finally got to try this place out. So I give the food a 4 star, good burger, solid ingredients and was cooked well. I ordered the farm burger which was duck bacon, honestly it tasted like normal bacon nothing different but bacon is always good so... Fried egg was cooked good too. The Parmesan fries we ordered had great flavor but weren't cooked that well, I think some were over cooked and some were under cooked so there was much consistency there for me. Long wait for parties of 3 or more so be prepared. I will for sure come back just might come on a more down time so it's not so busy and I can try one of their shakes which looked amazing."}
{"text":"Our server Alex was great. Our table was always cleaned promptly. Food was cooked perfectly. Glass was always filled with a beverage.  The truffle fries and onion rings were good. The burger with blue cheese was good as well. Hopefully I'll go again before my vacation is over."}
{"text":"The food itself is excellent in taste and presentation. Now the bad. If Gordon himself came here for a burger, he would be livid with the wait and overall service. I'm sure he'd ask how could a burger take so long and why do they check up on you only every 15-20 minutes? We were choking down the wonderful food because we couldn't get a refill of our drinks. Their use of texting to call you when your table is about to be ready made the wait palatable, but it is still a long wait. I just hope Mr. Ramsay visits soon to fix his own restaurant. Not sure I'd come back when considering price, wait and service just for a great tasting burger. I think I'd rather go to In n Out and spend my money on a nice dinner with a reservation and impeccable service."}
{"text":"Fast service and great staff. Burgers are okay good but nothing special;  GET A HOT DOG! !! the best I've ever had would gladly pay $25 for these dawgs!  Try the jalapeno poppers they great way to start."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent selection, great service, cool ambience in restaurant! Worth the wait and a real treat to eat here! Highly recommend this if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here to this restaurant and I have to say I had a great experience eating here. Everyone is very friendly, helpful, and very nice. We came here around 11:30 am and we had a 30 min wait and texted us when out table is ready, which is pretty cool, so we just walked around the casino played some games. We got our text and got our table. So we order our food; I got the American Burger with the meat medium cook and some hand cut French fries. As we are waiting for food my sister wants to get a beer and they showed us the options in the iPad which it was cool. We got our food and took that first bite and it was really amazing the meat was nice and juicy and the fries was good. I really like the restaurant and I will come again soon."}
{"text":"Fun spot! We chose to sit by the kitchen to watch them in action. The service was excellent. Farm burger was very tasty. Who knew there was duck bacon?! We also had the basic fries. They were good but nothing is crave. Served with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup. I preferred the curry although it was a very strong flavor that can over power the meal IMO. We also had the chanterelle mushroom burger. The onion jam overpowered the mushrooms. It was ok but I wouldn't order it again. We finished with the highly acclaimed creme brûlée pudding Oreo cookie shake. I'm now a big fan of creme brûlée pudding. Yumm! We will be back to try more options in the future."}
{"text":"Had the farm burger with duck bacon and sweet potato fries. Everything was great. The fries came out about five minutes before the burger which i thought was odd, but everything tasted good."}
{"text":"The quality is on point!  Beautiful place to eat at and enjoy a meal as well.  Friendly staff with great service. I also am in love with the truffle fries,  they are a must try!!"}
{"text":"Great experience.  For the top notch food, service and desert (You must try the toffee push ups) it didn't even seem that expensive.  We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came here after a show and waiting time was 45 mins to an hour.  Promised our son that we would eat here so we waited.    I do not care much for the fire decor they have going in the entrance.  Just a waste of gas and since it is spring and getting warmer, that area where they have the gas burning is uncomfortably hot.  Impractical and a waste of energy.   I sampled the farm burger and the one with the morel mushrooms. Liked the farm burger a lot. Also enjoyed the truffle Parmesan fries and the Oreo Shake, aka Shake #4.  Those 3 items get 4 stars.   Also tried the \"honey pork belly bao\" which I will never get from them again.   I make something similar and I was hoping to get a positive reference point for the pork belly baos.  Their's was a disappointment.  Uncured bacon slices smeared with the strong hoisin, and garnished with dill pickles?  It was just not good.  It tasted like an inexperienced cook put it together."}
{"text":"Being a HUGE Gordon Ramsay fan, I was beyond ecstatic to try BurGR. It was good, but nothing more than that. I wouldn't say I left disappointed, but I went in with such high hopes and it wasn't all that I had expected."}
{"text":"Went here expecting a fantastic burger! I was slightly disappointed. I got the Hells Kitchen Burger. It was good but did not knock my socks off. It was nothing extra special. The truffle fries were the best part. The parmesan and seasoning was throughout the entire thing and not just on the top few fries, which I liked. But the burger does not automatically come with the fries, you have to order them separately. Burger $15, fries $11.  Also had the antioxidant berry cocktail, again, good but not worth the $13 price tag. It is more expensive then it should be but you are on the strip and in a Ramsay restaurant so that was to be expected. Honestly, I would rather go to Red Robin for my burger and fry needs."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great service, very attentive and very friendly. The food is cooked to order so it takes a little longer than usual, but our food came out within 15 minutes so not bad. The food was so delicious! I had never had an onion ring taste to good! And the burgers were beyond anything I could ever imagine. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger, it was a little spicy but tolerable and very very good!! My friend had the Uber Cheese burger and it was so so so good!! So much cheesy goodness!!! We were stuffed and so very pleased. Love this place!! Everyone should try this place!!"}
{"text":"If you go when it first opens up then the wait to get through the door is less than 10 minutes. We had a party of 6 but if you're only a couple you'll be seated much faster or sit at the bar. The customer service was excellent and very fast considering it was a full house within 10 minutes of opening the doors.  We started with the jalapeno poppers - be careful because one of them still have the seeds and stem hidden - other than that little surprise those suckers are pretty good. You only get six but well worth it.  I got the Farm Burger medium and my hubby for the Blue Burger medium rare. The burgers melt in your mouth and they do not need any type of sauce.   The Farm Burger has a fried egg with duck breast bacon and sharp cheddar cheese. I cut mine in half and watched the egg drip over the burger...yummers!  Overall I'd go back. It's a little on the expensive side but hey its Chef Ramsey so its worth it at least once."}
{"text":"By far the juiciest most flavorful burger I have ever had, better than my previous favorites BLT burgers and Holstien's Burger and Bun, which are fine burgers in their own right! Farm Burger is outstanding, Hell's Kitchen Burger also first rate! You can tell it's great food when it just gets better bite after bite! Great service we were pampered!"}
{"text":"Finally a celebrity chef who's name 100% lives up to the quality of food in his restaurant. The burgers were outstanding and the fries even better. Reasonably priced for Vegas strip and 100% worth a trip. Next time I am in town this will be one of my first stops for food."}
{"text":"My first time trying a Gordon ramsay restaurant and this place did not disappoint.   Located inside planet Hollywood you won't miss it with the fire lighting up on the sign.  This place works best if you have a smaller party of two bugger parties have a longer wait. We waited maybe about 30 minutes on a Friday?  For appetizer we tried the roasted jalapeños there was definitely a surprise. More than enough to share for three as an appetizer but it was so delicious perfect for the two of us. The ranch like sauce had like some kind of hot oil in it making the jalapeño peppers spicier than normal but I was so addicted to them.  My boyfriend had the hell burger and I had the farm burger. The farm burger was delicious with duck bacon , cheddar, and fried egg. That duck bacon was thicker than regular bacon and it just made a major difference in the burger. If you love bacon a must try. It just melted in my mouth with the gorgeous egg yolk that broke when you bit into the burger.  For dessert I had to try the sticky toffee push pop since I love sticky toffee pudding. Presentation super adorable came in a push pop the ice cream was lovely a peanut flavor with the pudding like toffee cake alternating layors of the two it was the perfect way to end our meal.  Our server was amazing, our food was so good, definitely made my evening."}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had. Juicy and absolutely delicious. The decor and service was exceptional. They have a verity of fries that are amazing especially with the different sauces. If you are craving a burger this is s must go place for one of the best burgers you'll have."}
{"text":"Great burgers- husband had the farm burger and I had the euro burger with arugula and roasted tomatoes... both were delicious. We also shared the truffle fries which were also great! The only ding was that we went for lunch, and it seemed like as soon as we said we weren't ordering alcohol we kind of got forgotten about... no drink refills. But, great food."}
{"text":"After watching numerous shows on television about Gordon Ramsay that piqued my desire to try dining at one of his restaurants, I decided to opt for a \"lower\" (relative term) cost option at the Planet Hollywood. Walking in, I saw a bunch (read 6 or 7) of hostesses in short skirts and iPads making small talk with people around. \"This place is decorated fancy,\" I thought. The tables looked pristine and there were pictures of Ramsay and fire (hinting Hell's Kitchen I suppose) all around. I could not miss the huge Keg Cellar in the background. This is what I expected a top chef bar/burger joint would look like - trendy, casual and spacious.  In spite of it being really late in the night - post midnight, and the place half full, our hostess insisted on feeding our information into her iPad to tell us that our table would be ready in 45 minutes. I must say time flies fast in Vegas because in 5 minutes we were texted that our table was ready. The hostess seemed like it was a daily affair - I guess iPad's do not replace brains and common sense.   Anyways, after being seated at our table, we had some time to ponder over our menu (as our server was busy serving two other tables at that time and the menu being short and sweet). She was polite but was not enthusiastic and seemed like she was doing a chore. Thanks to yelp we did not need any suggestions and we ordered shake, 2 burgers, a chicken slider plate and a side of fries.   Watching other dishes coming out of the kitchen, I was tempted - the hot dog was one of them, but alas we already had ordered too much food. To keep up with Celebrity chef standard, the food came out decorated really well, and looking appetizing.   The shake was the Creme Brulee (which others had praised on yelp). I thought it was good but a little heavy.. (maybe I am not a shake guy). My beer gave me good company while I waited anxiously for our food to arrive.   30 minutes later we received our Five Spice Chicken sliders. I could so pass this dish - fried chicken - meh!  Another 15 minutes and I received my burger (cut in two pieces which is awesome as I can't really fit the whole thing in my mouth anyway). I decided to sample my wife's Euro burger too, in addition to devouring my own Hell's Kitchen burger. The burger is not too big so you will definitely need your own. The meat was cooked perfectly (a plus for cutting the burger into two so you can see the inside). The Hell's Kitchen burger had the kick of the Jalapeno peppers (which I have found to be doused in other places). The Euro burger had some other toppings which were equally delightful. I find it hard to rank the two but as I liked the spice in the Hell's Kitchen burger I would probably give it a slight edge.   The Truffle Parmesan fries were tasty, a different flavor profile than I have tried before and were not too greasy. However the fries starting seeming soggy as I passed the first few. It appeared that they had been prepared a few minutes (10 or more) earlier and were lying under the lamp heat. I would still say these fries are a try at BURGR.  Overall, due to the trendy atmosphere, tasty burgers, nicely decorated plates AND moderately decent service, silly experience with the hostess and soggy fries I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Read the reviews. Had to try it as I do enjoy Kitchen Nightmares and wanted to see how a GR restaurant holds up.  Overall it was an exceptional restaurant experience. Service was fantastic. The waitress was knowledgable and attentive. Nathan one of the employees was running around checking on people and clearing tables. I assumed he was the manager. Turns out he was a busboy. The best bus boy I had ever seen.  Food was great, I got the Hell's Kitchen and my wife got the European.  The beef was juicy and cooked perfectly.  The toppings were perfect as well. They added to the flavor of the ground beef rather than cover it up. The onion rings and fries were great as well. Yes everything is expensive but this is the Las Vegas strip. It is competitively priced with everything else."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it, I got the farm Burger with the duck bacon and fried egg and it was a bonus that my friend who doesn't eat beef was able to substitute  chicken for any burger option they had.  Our server was good, drinks we're pretty good, the only drawback is the whole waiting for a hostess to be seated.  Not sure why but there was about 5 tables empty and there was a long line to be seated.  After about 10 min of watching the girls at front talk to each other about their day, they started filling the tables.  I think they like the concept that people are in line so it makes more people interested and then also get in line.  Good marketing maybe, but not on my time."}
{"text":"Yes, I've seen Ramsay's shows....and yes, he comes across as a screaming maniac. But after seeing Kitchen Nightmares and hearing him preach about how to make a successful restaurant, trust me: DUDE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, and he absolutely practices what he preaches.  A little bit pricy, but hey, it's the Vegas strip, so what do you expect? I'll tell you what to expect:  BEST BURGER EVER. And I live in Chicago, where there's no shortage of awesome burgers.  I told the wait staff that if Chef Ramsay happens to show up while I'm there, I want to buy him a drink for having such good burgers on the menu. I was told he does go there surprisingly frequently and that he's really cool..."}
{"text":"We only had to wait 20 mins to get seated.  The onion rings are the bomb.  We split the fish sandwich and it was the best ever.   I couldn't believe how good the and fresh the bread was.  The parmesan fries were ok.  Ill definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try a burger here but unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. I've tried various burger spots on the strip, and this did not compare to Burger Bar or even Shake Shack (sorry!). We only ate half of our burgers and I couldn't even bring myself to eat the other half the next day....Instead I just threw it away because it looked so unappealing... I had the bacon/avocado \"special\" burger and my bf had the burger with the egg (sorry I can't remember the names), and I would not recommend neither, nor will I be coming back."}
{"text":"The jalapeño poppers and pork hamburger are the best things on the menu here. The rest of the burgers are plain and lacking flavor. Service sucked and our waiter was rude. He charged my card and made an error in the price. I only found out when I checked my bank statement. The next day we had to call a manager and figure it out. Keep your receipts from here they will come in handy. Thanks BurGR!"}
{"text":"BurGR has the absolute best burgers by far. I loved the food here. The meat was so fresh, juicy, and generously portioned.   However,what made this the best burger I've ever had???  The bun!!! I don't know what they do to their buns, but they tasted buttery and slightly crispy, they were perfect. The bun completes the perfection of the burger.   The time that we went we didn't have to wait, but I know there generally is a pretty decent wait! Wait, beleive me it is so worth it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of time now and the food is hands down the best of its burger category!  You can get your burger cooked to your liking and they have a few different topping selections that are pre set to choose from! All of them are great in quality.   Price wise they need to bring it down a bitch at the end of the day it's just a burger, no need to charge $14 for each one!   Wings are amazing, haven't tasted anything like it before must try!  The downfall here, there is usually a long line up up get seated and the hostess usually comes up and tells you it will be an hour but honestly it's WAYYYYY LESS than that! Wait is about 30 min on a average and this is around 8pm.  I'm not sure why they say that to people who are waiting, I've actually seen many people turn away and leave because of this!  Anyway, if your down for a good tasting burger and don't mind spending basically nearly double the cost of the average one I recommend this!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! My wife and I noticed it walking down the strip, and beings fans of Gordon Ramsey, decided to give it a go. The wait time was about 30 minutes on a Saturday evening. The environment inside the restaurant is a lot of fun, but not too crazy. The waiter was very fast and professional, he knew the menu very well and gave outstanding recommendations. The beer batter onion rings are to die for, cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and comes with a really nice ranch and barbeque dipping sauce. The burgers were amazing. Juicy, but didn't have that nasty, gritty greasy texture that 99.9% of burgers out there have. The chicken burger was very good as well. Finally, top it off with an Oreo shake. The shake was so smooth and creamy, and at the same time wasn't so rich it would make your mouth raw. Overall, or experience it was top of the line, and is definitely on our favorite list for when we come back to Vegas next time!"}
{"text":"1. Gordon Ramsay is my favorite celebrity chef. 2. Eat with confidence that the kitchen is spotless. 3. The shakes are absolutely delicious. 4. The burgers are cooked perfectly 5. Expect me to eat there again."}
{"text":"Great food there. Drinks were a bit pricey though. The burgers were cooked perfectly. Service was excellent. Our waitress was amazing she was pretty fast with things and very thorough with explaining the menu.  I had the fury wings as an appetizer and that was delicious. The parmasean fries I wasn't too crazy about. The. For entree I had the Hell's Kitchen burger. The pepper gave it a nice spice to it.   Def would love to go back again!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger joint in Vegas. Had the hell's fire burger, sweet potato fries, wings for appetizer and a chocolate shake. Everything tasted fresh. Burger was great size and cooked to perfection. Sweet potato fries were so good and were sprinkled with powdered sugar. Wings were amazing. Service was awesome.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great service- great burger...and they are open late...I have been here at 2 a.m. and for lunch...yum yum yum I love the sauce for the onion rings and the fries...I love the British Burger with chutney and cheddar cheese...cooked to perfection...I will be back"}
{"text":"Simply delicious, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is a lower end and simpler version of what he dishes out at Steak.  An open, colorful dining and a short menu of grill items makes for a lively and casual meal!  But because it's one of Gordon's spots, you might have to wait...  Our table of four got seated after a 30 minute wait and we ordered up some bao buns and jalapeno poppers.  The buns were tasty, a different app given its Asian origins but the poppers rocked!  Six square glasses each with popper and dipping sauce, yuh-may!  The poppers werent' greasy at all and the smoky sauce added a lot of flavor.  My burger came stacked with fresh ingredients and was full of flavor and texture.  Gordon certainly knows his way around meat, even if its ground.     Overall I had a great meal at BurGR but it's still pricey.  Double or triple what you might spend at In n Out and you've got an idea of the price point, $25 and up.  But you know what?  It's still really worth it!  Rock on, Ramsay..."}
{"text":"Place is elegant. There was a one hour wait time when we arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday. But they took my contact down and text'd me when the table was ready. So we were free to roam the casino. The location was obscured in Planet Hollywood and not located on the map. So it was somewhat difficult to find without guidance from a casino employee.   We got seated and the server lent us an ipad for the drinks menu, which presented a wide variety of fine wines and cocktails.  For appetizers we decided to try the truffle fries. The most amazing fries I ever had. The way the oil blends with the Parmesan is orgasmic. Paired with the homemade ketchup and black truffle aioli, nothing could compare.  And what could possibly beat a gordon Ramsey burger? I ordered the chanterelle burger. It contained chanterelle mushrooms, argula, figgy-onion jam. Had it cooked medium rare, which in my opinion is the best way to cook a beef patty. The onions and the sweetness of the jam was paired nicely with the patty and the mushrooms. I couldn't ask for a better burger. It was gone in 60 seconds. I practically inhaled the burger without chewing.  I recommend the place to anyone visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"BurGR is definitely a fun place.  I'm not a big fan of GR's TV persona or schtick.  Though there is something positive to be said about his mercurial nature and focus on detail.  So, given our short eleven hours in Vegas, we decided to come here.  At the heart of BurGR, you'll find some good food and I believe GR poking fun at himself.  The restaurant has several photos, as does the menu, of him hands up in a fit of mock anger.  I believe, there's a wee sparkle and impishness in those eyes.  So, what about the food you say?  It's good!  Very good in fact.  And, those BurGRs are worth every penny of the $14.00 to $17.00 you'll pay to enjoy them.  The reason isn't too hard to understand.  Given that mercurial nature, GR chose to cook the food: \"Paying special attention to not only the ingredients but the method, beef patties will be cooked over an open flame fueled by hard woods.\"    So it isn't too difficult to see why they have a complex smokey taste, that layers nicely with the various toppings and ingredients.   We had the American and Euro BurGRs.  The Euro (photo) came with truffle aioli, goat cheese and arugula, while the American came with american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.  Both were delicious, though the Euro was more interesting on the palate.  GR's focus to detail even shows up on the selection of the bun. Nice!  Another WOW if you will, were the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Seems the BurGR fries are \"hand-cut and thrice cooking will ensure extra crispness\" and they use Kennebec instead of Russet potatoes  which \"offering a lighter, less starchy and crisper fry\"    Okay, we agree.  But what makes them special, is the hair like shavings of parmesan cheese (photo) with a special aioli oil sauce for dipping. Ohh, are they good.  So, with a glass of wine, a nice pint of Leinenkugel on tap, a couple of BurGRs and some of those wonderful Truffle Fries, expect to pay around $27.50 each, not including gratuities or taxes.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hell's kitchen burger medium rare came out perfect great flavor, American burger was awesome as agreed by unanimous decision by the wife and kids. We tried the parm.fries onion rings and sweet potato fries a little wet grease but full of flavor. The topper was the. Milk shakes the#2and #5 the family said to die for, went from lets try one to I want my own. Only complaint which is minute was the sauces you cant tell the difference in the ketsup other than the server telling you what they are. The Honey jalepeno mayo was sadly bland and waxy. I would recommend Burgr to anyone who comes to Vegas and I cannot wait for my return."}
{"text":"This place is really good! The prices are not too bad considering its on the strip where everything is way over priced. We went on saturday night and waited for about 30 minutes before going in. The food was great and the service awesome! We had the jalapeño poppers, the euro burger and the parm truffle fries. Everything was amazing! And our glasses never got empty before we got a refill, the service was really good. The food is great, definitely worth it."}
{"text":"As for the burgers, nothing to complain. Meat tasted natural and ordered the way I wanted. All the ingredients were fresh and and fries had all the flavor needed, no additional salt or other ingredients be needed. Can't complain, one of the best burgers ever had. But, $15 for a burger it's probably a little too much. Would still come back because the burger is that would even if I have to over pay a little. Again, it's Vegas, you over pay for everything."}
{"text":"Back again for the 2nd time.  Nice IPA and spicy Bloody Mary.   Parmesan fries are great... HUGE portion  Poke salad is soooooo good and refreshing   And Hell's Kitchen burger...bomb, bomb, bomb... something to compliment that spicy Mary"}
{"text":"The food was good, not over the top. The hostess stand lacked a lot of personality. There were 5 and not one greeted us or ever smiled. The outfits were terrible all the way around! The waitresses were great. At the end of the day it was just a burger. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my husband had the Farmhouse Burger. We also had the Truffle Fries."}
{"text":"Pricey place to grab a burger... But totally worth trying.  We ordered jalapeno poppers for an appetizer... Can you say, yummy?!  They came out quickly, served on a wooden plank in 6 shot glasses.  Each fried pepper was dipped in a unique kind of sauce.  We could not pinpoint the flavor, but it was a great starter to order.  We washed down the heat with a few beers.  The burgers were a nice size... Very flavorful and seasoned well.  Truffle fries were awesome.  Portions were a nice size.  The price was on the high end (for a burger), but you truly get what you pay for.    The week we were in Vegas, the weather in the 40's and we were seated by the door so we froze during our entire meal, but it was totally worth it.  Although we sat in the bar, it was a cute trendy little restaurant with good quality food and quick service!  Would love to dine in the restaurant portion next time we visit."}
{"text":"Just ate the Euro burger with the truffle fries.  Terrific!!  Ranks high among best burgers I've had. I am amazed that in a place this big that they are able to deliver quality burgers.  Requested medium and it was cooked medium.  Delicious bun and just the right amount of goat cheese.  Spot on.  Truffle fries were great also.  10!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for dinner before heading for my flight home.  They sat us at the table in the front of the restaurant.  You're basically on display to everyone coming into the casino.  Burgers are very good, but expensive.  The fries are great but you pay extra for them.   Beer selection was on a tablet, so you could get an idea of what each selection had to offer.  They had a nice selection and it wasn't too pricey.    Overall, very good.  I'd come here again."}
{"text":"With Gordan Ramsay's unique and fiery personality, you would expect great burgers from his restaurant. After all, it shouldn't be that hard to grill medium rare burger right?   Being a fan of his show, Hell's Kitchen, I had to order the Hell's Kitchen burger, along with the Farm burger.  Both did not disappoint as we were practically wearing the juices on our sleeves; the epitome of a great burger. It might just be me, but I loved the Farm burger more as I'm a huge fan of burgers with a sunny side egg. The burgers and truffle fries are definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I want to meet Gordon Ramsay, he knows how to handle a successful business, love that quality about him.  You can tell he prides himself on his restaurants, just by observing the staff.  Our server was so accommodating, it's the most memorable part of my dining experience.    On to the burger!  I love burgers, I am always talking about Vegas' best burger.  Some of these include Flemmings' burger that you can get at the bar, Tommy Bahama's kobe burger, Holstein's,  Del Taco's Double Del Cheeseburger, etc... And I must say, the two burgers I got (The Hell's kitchen burger, and their mushroom burger, forgot name) are good contenders.  The burgers are cooked exactly to their order, the beef is tender, and the ingredients that are added on are well thought out.  The roasted tomato in the Hells Kitchen burger is guaranteed a new flavor for you to have in a burger, and I must say, I loved it.  The mushroom burger though not as unique as the Hells Kitchen, still a well crafted burger and still highly enjoyable, but nothing you haven't already had.  Desert, one of the most unique I have ever had, and will always remember this desert.  The milkshakes are about 3/4 milkshake, and they are topped off w pudding in the top 1/4.  Wow, we had cocunut pudding with strawberry milkshake.  Indulgent and so good, a must share.  I love Gordon, I love when he gets into his fits on TV, I love when he yells at people, I want to eat more burgers and desert here and have him yell in my face, that would be awesome.  Best Gordon TV quote, \"This is rancidddddddddd!!!!!\""}
{"text":"Where to start......... Staff was super friendly!!! Atmosphere was okay, nothing spectacular. Food was just so-so. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. This burger looked so goood! Took my first bite and was like \"WTH\" no taste! I thought, okay maybe it's just me, dining ad my bf try it. Nope! It was very bland, had no flavor. The staff was super nice and exchanged it for the Farm Burger, which I completely recommend. But you're gonna want to get it medium rare. Cook it anymore and it loses flavor. So 3 stars is all I give it."}
{"text":"Highlights:  HELLS KITCHEN BURGER: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato - the jalapeno pepper and avocado complement each other well! Like, REALLY WELL. - I highly recommend this burger  FARM BURGER: duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar, fried egg - Good hearty combination, but I've had this executed better at other places.   TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES: it was okay. A bit too much for me.   I ordered medium rare and it was cooked to perfection.   I was eyeing all of the shakes around me the entire time--I'll have to give that a try next time!  Also, expect vegas prices."}
{"text":"I had VERY high expectations for this place, simply because of the GR name attached to it, and I am a huge food network fan. But maybe because of those high expectations, this place didn't quite deliver for me ):  I split the farm burger & truffle fries with a friend. And the burger was good, yes, but not amazing. Admittedly, everything was well cooked, nicely made, and beautifully presented, but the burger just seemed to be missing something. I think maybe I would've liked some lettuce or tomatoes in my burger? Some kind of veggies to balance out the patty and the egg? The fries were good, but not noteworthy either. Their house ketchup was different, and I probably would've preferred just plain-ol' heinz.  Anywho, overall, the burgers were good, just not as good as I would've expected from GR. Maybe if the bar hadn't been set so high, this place would've gotten 4 stars instead of 3. But solid burgers, decently priced for being on the strip, just don't expect amazing."}
{"text":"Short line to get seated that moved along pretty quickly.  Once seated the service was slow, but worth the wait.  Had a burger and onion rings.  Both were very good.  Went on a Monday afternoon and the place was jumping!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service,  food was great! Truffle fries a little salty but other then that well worth it. We started with beer battered onion rings light and crispy with a cheddar ranch dipping sauce. ...WOW. We then shared apple Caesar  salad tart , savory,  and a hint of sweet with the apple. Had a few truffle fries, bit to salty for me, the manager came over and asked if we would like new ones,  he was kind and thoughtful.  Then the burgers!  Mouth watering, and delicious I had the signature Hells Kitchen with jalapeno, avocado, roasted tomatoes and cheese.  With every bite I didn't want it to end. My hubby had the Farm burger that had egg on it, look amazing.  The shakes were ok but I have had better.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable of the whole menu. Gordon has done it again and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Yummy delicious burger! I got the Chanterelle burger and my b/f got the Hog burger. We started off with the truffle parmesan fries and the shake #4 (the one w the creme brûlée pudding in it). The shake was SO AWESOME! It was so creamy and delicious we were very impressed! (We kinda ended up getting full even before our burgers though between the fries and sharing the shake so keep that in mind.) We both enjoyed our burgers thoroughly and was were NOT disappointed!  The restaurant set up is pretty cool with the fire display out front and a large touch screen menu out front so you can check out the menu while you stand in line.  Only reason I giving four stars instead of five is we didn't feel as welcomed by waitstaff in this restaurant as others. I notice a few other ppl mentioning that as well....maybe it's their \"thing\" to be indifferent and not smile but I wouldn't run MY restaurant like that....just sayin. Other than that VERY delish and recommend to ANYONE who likes/loves a good burger!  ENJOY!  p.s. we didn't get a chance to try these but my brother swears by the onion rings! we are definitely going to try em next time!"}
{"text":"You obviously have to get the truffle fries- amazing!!! I'm giving it 4/5 because the one veggie option was really disappointing. It wasn't a burger, but a mushroom instead. Really soggy and no flavor- not even salt. I expected a place like this to have an awesome in house veggie burger so that was a big letdown."}
{"text":"I will never go here again.   Our last day in Vegas -- I must admit, hungover -- and we just wanted some good food to end our amazing Vegas experience before going home. We walked by to see if there was still a tremendously long line like usual; but lucky for us, there wasn't -- or so we thought we were lucky.   We were the first ones there so we were seated quickly for a party of 7. The restaurant started getting packed and 30+ minutes later, we still didn't get our food while everyone else that got there after us did. I finally talked to the manager and she brought out our burgers that came out COLD and rare when we asked for medium well. We waited THAT long for a sloppy order?! Are you kidding me? I talked to her again. We waited longer and our order came out BURNT. At this point, 2/7 just didn't want to eat their burgers. We ate ours out of hunger and headache, but it was a pain eating burnt burgers.  Our bill came out and I was highly upset that the manager didn't cater to us at all. I had to request 50% off the bill because I was definitely not going to pay full price for wrong orders and horrible service. Instead, she took two burgers off and gave us free dessert. If you have excellent customer service, I shouldn't have to approach you for things like that. BJ's and Applebee's even does a better job in catering to customers.   Their dessert that came out was disgusting, but who would deny free food? Not me! The only thing really good about this place were their fries. Other than that, this place is way too hyped up as a Gordon Ramsay place. Looks like he needs to do a better job with restaurants.   My best friends tried his other restaurant the day after and had horrible service with the manager there too. It's just upsetting.   C'mon... for a nice restaurant with great reviews, you should know to never mess around with a customer's food when they're hungry -- especially when they're also hungover!   NEVER AGAIN. I could've settled with Earl's Sandwich even though I ate there for three consecutive days. Would've been so much better than this though."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to the celebrity chef restaurants because they always are overpriced and disappoint. This one however was excellent. I had hummus which was creamy and was not over season, and then a perfectly cook cheeseburger with hand-cut crispy french fries. The atmosphere in here is great in the decor is colorful and casual. It's a little pricey but well worth it."}
{"text":"Can one really stand out when just sitting in the middle of the crowd? There are celebrity eateries everywhere in Las Vegas, and gourmet burgers are a dime a dozen.   Well, more like 1560 dimes a dozen. These things really aren't cheap.  I get it, this is not a typical burger. In fact, I went with the Farm Burger, which was topped with duck breast bacon and an egg. Truth is, at the $14 price tag (saving a buck by showing my players club card), it failed to knock my socks off. I will happily pay $14 for hosiery loosening masticable delectables, but alas, my footwear was left firmly in place.  My belt did need to be loosened a bit though...  The Truffle Parmesan Fries at $11 were the real star, and the one order was plenty for our table. The crème brûlée pudding and oreo shake made a fine accompaniment, even at $8. But when it came to the 3 vs. 4 star question, I found my self asking: will I be coming back?  There are just so many other places to try. Places that stand above the crowd, carrying the socks they knocked off, filled with my hard earned dimes."}
{"text":"Cela faisait un moment que nous voulions gouter un des fameux burger de Gordon Ramsay. C'est chose faite à présent !  Très bon produit. Un peu d'attente et un peu cher mais bon... c'est Las Vegas !!"}
{"text":"Truffle fries and a unique take on burGR's make it a fun, accessible Ramsey establishment. Not to downplay BurGR, but I thought the burger au poivre at Mon Ami Gabi was definitely superior."}
{"text":"This is based on the food alone as that's what most yelp reviews are intended for.   Ordered: Uber Cheese Burger and Fries   Burger was under seasoned and the cheese was no standout. Cooked perfectly medium but just lacked any flavor. Gordon always said something along the lines of teaching up and coming cooks to \"always taste the food\". In this case, not even Uber Cheese can save this burger.   As stated on the menu, the fries...were Just Fries. Again under seasoned or no seasoning with lackluster flavors on the dipping sauces."}
{"text":"We were excited about having a good burger in Vegas... But alas this place wasn't the greatest for the Best Burger. Nevertheless, the burger was just ok. It was expensive for what you got, but then again it's Vegas right??  The milkshakes were awesome though! I would go just for the milkshake and the ability to watch football on one of their large screen tv's. Overall 2.5 stars but, milkshake brought it up to a 3. The ambience is fine. The drinks cold! The waitstaff nice. The service was fine as well. Our burgers were undercooked but they quickly remedied the situation. Probably will not return as there are way too many choices for a meal!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the service was really good. It's interesting using the iPad to look at their menu haha and the sweet potato fries are really good too!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this 3 stars, but they dropped the ball when I came.   I'm a fan of Gordan Ramsay. Not necessarily his shows, but the way he conducts his restaurants. The customer should always be cared for. We tried this place out because I love burgers. We started with some of their shakes. The creme brule shake is unbelievable. Holy shit. The parmesan fries are top notch. Service was responsive. So far so good. Now the main course. We get our burger. The bun is perfect, the tomato slices wow, you could tell they put soo much effort into the small details to make every part of the burger amazing, except for the burger itself. I don't know if they guy they had working back there knew what he was doing, but the burgers tasted like charcoal. I'm assuming this is an isolated incident, but it only takes one mistakte to ruin someone's view on Burgr. A restaurant has to be perfect every time. Ramsay would agree with this, per his Masterchef quotes. I would definitely try this again and give it another shot. If they cooked the patty correctly, this would have been the greatest burger place I'd ever been."}
{"text":"An intentional move to fuel the corporatized celebrity chef disease that has overtaken the wasteland of Vegas. Waited in a really long line for something that Gordon Ramsey would have been ashamed of had he not sold his soul to the devils of Sin City.   ROASTED JALAPEÑO POPPERS - Cheddar bacon, cheddar ranch, one fiery surprise  I think Gordy was trying to showcase his Michelin 3 star plating techniques by serving each popper in its own shot glass. Unfortunately this was about as exciting as it got for this appetizer. I love jalapeños, and these were soft and smoky, but the breading and the sauce struck me as quite low-end--greasy, cheap, & fake.   FARM BURGER - duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, fried egg  Mnnn, duck breast bacon!? Meh, not so much. It was overly salty and so strong that it detracted rather than contributed. The sharp cheddar went practically unnoticed (perhaps not sharp enough?). And while my companion's Farm Burger had a gloriously runny yolk, mine did not, which pissed on the entire experience. It wasn't ugly, but I'm sure that Gordy wouldn't have been satisfied.   TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES - Hand cut fries, truffle Parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli  These hand-cut fries tasted almost identical to the kind you can get in the frozen section of the grocery store. Sprinkling dry Parmesan on top didn't make it any more glamorous, plus none of it stayed on when you picked up a fry. And I didn't taste any truffle in the Parmesan or in the salt. It was served with some ketchup (meh) and truffle aioli, which was actually pretty good because it actually tasted truffly.   SHAKE #4 - Crème brûlée pudding, Oreo shake, Oreo cookie  This was a lovely visual experience, but it didn't taste as pretty as it looked. The Oreo shake portion was passable, but the Crème brûlée pudding was essentially just really thick Jello Instant Vanilla pudding, which no hint of burnt goodness.   ALL IN ALL:  Really, Gordy--have you ever eaten here? The food isn't awful, but do you really consider it worthy of your namesake? I wouldn't slap my name on any restaurant that I wasn't personally managing & vouching for. In doing so, you've diluted your brand, and in the end, people will view BurGR for what it really is--a mirage in the city of illusions."}
{"text":"After a 20minute wait we finally got in! Worth the wait. Solid burgers and drinks. The sweet potato fries were just ehh.  The euro burger, medium rare, was tops of the evening The Hell's Kitchen burger, medium, even though it was good, was missing something. Every bite was different and the taste was not distributed evenly throughout.  They had a black cherry flavored whiskey mixed with mike's hard lemonade that was awesome!!  Recommend it for a quick, filling, inexpensive dinner before hitting the strip!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the jet lag, but I just didn't really enjoy my burger here.  I ordered the pork burger and it was just a dry salty patty with stuff on it.  It said it had pulled pork on top but it had less than a spoonful.  I also had the gooey fries.  Meh is the best way to describe them.   The milk shake on the other hand was very good.  The custard milk shake combo was nice.  However for the price the milk shake was pretty small."}
{"text":"Awesome food, but Ramsay really won't put his name on anything less.  Burgers are well worth everything, I've been there twice and tried one pork and one normal.  My friend's pork he claimed was overcooked, but I thought mine was excellent.  Fries are interesting and out of the ordinary.  I'm not really sure why they have a wait most of the time, they don't fill all the seats all the time, maybe it's to feel more \"exclusive.\"  Wait staff is pretty solid and attentive, but the (female) outfits are awesome.  I want to get my girlfriend one..."}
{"text":"Not impressed! Food was ok but I rated it low because for the price its nothing special. If you want a side of fries with your burger its $8.00 extra. The burgers are $15.00.  You could get a burger as good or better at Applebee's."}
{"text":"This burger was better than your standard burger. But I have a smaller appetite and this was what I would consider to be a much smaller burger for the price. On top of that I didn't find this burger particularly outstanding in any way. Its way better than your standard burger but with so many craft burger joints out nowadays I wouldn't rate this among the top by any means. The wait for the place did not help. 40min wait for a sub par burger. Don't let this stop you from an experience. As I do believe this is one of the places to say, \"you've eaten at\" in Las Vegas. Just don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"Delicious! This is our first time here and the burgers blows us away. It's grilled to perfection. Each bite is an explosion of flavors in your month. We came on a Friday around 5, got a table right away. After we sat down, the line up began. Next time I would not order fries again tho because it is too flavorful for my liking, but I can see other people really enjoy them:)"}
{"text":"Overpriced. The burger was meh and the pizza was bland. The \"truffle fries\" were a little soggy an didn'"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! We didn't have to wait for a table and the food was tasty. The truffle fries are also very tasty."}
{"text":"Second best burger of my life! My boyfriend and i visited this place and we had a to-go cuz we were in a hurry to go other places. The packaging was great with the Gordon Ramsey's face on it haha I tried Hell's Kitchen and my boyfriend tried something else that i don't remember. But the Hell's Kitchen was like the best! I'm big fan of spicy savory food and this Hell's Kitchen just took my heart.. I still can't forget the moment i had the bite and i had that juicy and spicy flavor in my mouth. Gosh i wanna go back and try it again!!!!!"}
{"text":"The hosted said an 1 1/2 hour wait. We were seated in 30 minutes! Super friendly staff, food was AMAZING!!! I ordered the American, it was good but the hubby ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, and it was soooo good. I recommend that one along with the truffle fries. When I go back to Vegas, I will be eating here for sure :D oh and Christina the winner of Hell's Kitchen to work at Gordon Ramsay STEAK is now at Burgr, glad to see a Hell's Kitchen winner success"}
{"text":"I would give this resaurant 5 stars but because of the long wait for the food I can only give it two stars.To bad since they have the best hamburgers on the strip.If you do not mind waiting 45 minutes for lunch then it is worth eating there."}
{"text":"Just go. Worth the wait. It's gorden ramsey's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gogogogogogogo. Tried veggie burger which was as delicious as my friends meat burger. Services were perfect."}
{"text":"It is located in the Planet Hollywood Casino. The staffs are friendly and fun. My favorite is actually the jalapeno poppers, which only 1 of them had the seeds and was extra spicy. Somehow I picked that one on my first bite! My mouth was on fire for awhile. Burgers were decent. It is a Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, so there's always a line."}
{"text":"This place blows. The food is mediocre at best when it doesn't arrive burnt or improperly cooked. 11 dollar french fries? Fuck that. Rude burger-body blonde bitch at the front has a shitty attitude. No pictures of the food anywhere, just Ramsey's ugly face on everything. This is simply a poor imitation of eureka burger in Claremont California. Ramsey is a dirty wanker and a no talent hack. Save yourself 30 dollars and go to in and out."}
{"text":"Ramsay needs to film an episode of Kitchen Nightmares here.  The food and service are nowhere near what he should be offering from a restaurant with his name on it.  Service was slow.  Our waitress went on lunch before our food came out we were told.  The soda was really flat.  Im no soda snob, but both the root beer and pepsi were flat.  For $4.00 each,They should at least come with carbonation.   Asked for a Miller Lite, 15 mins later got an unknown beer that was def not Miller Lite.  Burgers were overcooked. MW when ordered Med.  Cheese was not melted.  Fries were undercooked.  Just overall not what you would expect from a guy who demands such high standards from the people he helps and trains.   The best part was actually the Ketchup (Catsup) which is made in-house.  Doubt I would eat there again just for that though."}
{"text":"The Cesar salad was horribly drenched in dressing. The chicken in the sliders was hard and very thin. Very disappointing for a \"Ramsey\" establishment."}
{"text":"Very good burger. Wife had the chicken burger and I had the farmhouse. Also had truffle fries and jalapeño poppers. The poppers were outstanding but the fries not so much. Fries were cardboard-y at best. The service was also outstanding. Just don't expect to have the best burger of your entire life that made you see God and you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Definitely not disappointed! I ordered a Hell's Kitchen burger and my boyfriend ordered the Euro burger. Perks of being in a relationship is I get to try more dishes of food! The Hell's Kitchen burger was not as spicy as i thought it would be and had hoped for, but it was definitely flavorful. The euro burger was rich and tasty. Both were delicious and paired nicely with the Innis and Gunn beer. This beer was smooth and has a subtle hint of whisky  definitely worth a try! Price is a little high for what it is, but then again, we are on the strip."}
{"text":"Ever since watching Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares, I have grown fond of the character Gordan Ramsey. Indeed, his television persona is unabashed by telling chefs who fail. and why they fail. This alongside talent critique Simon Cowell both evoke a kind of brutal honesty unPC \"truthiness\" post 9-11. They may even well have been the first critiques to pioneer this type of mentality. And this was an interesting marketing allure with a huge payoff, because the general public craved honesty that was not necessarily PC. The result, an instant hit!  I have however heard numerous chefs criticizing Chef Gordan Ramsey, claiming that he is really a charlatan, and his \"cooking\" is really just marketing tactics and hype. How do I see it you ask?  I ordered the Farm Burger and the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  As a native of Chicago, I have to say, that this burger has to contend with Kuma's Corner, which I highly consider the best burger I have eaten: both in presentation, ambiance, and service.   The burger comes a la carte. Meaning, the burger is priced at 15$ dollar but without fries. But, I'm in a spending mood, so I purchased the truffle parmesan fries as well.  1) The burger was good. I ordered it medium rare, and that's exactly what I got. It was not better than Kuma's corner unfortunately. Recall back to  the  infamous episode-- \"Amy's Bakery,\" where Gordan Ramsey criticizes the blue ribbon burger for being soggy. In an ironic twist, I felt this was the main problem with this burger. It was soggy. I don't know if the egg contributed to the problem. Maybe next time I will get anything other than the farm burger.  Burger is 3/5 stars.   2) The Truffle Parmesan Fries at a resounding $11 dollars, was absolutely flawless, and may be the best fries I have eaten in my life. The fries were hand cut and crunchy and came with truffle aioli (mayonnaise like truffle mushroom sauce), and ketchup curry. The ketchup curry was also some of the best ketchup I've eaten in my life!  Fries are 5/5 stars.   So, overall my experience was 4/5 stars. The service was also exceptional, and best of all, for one person, there was NO WAIT! If you are on a tight budget, I would actually suggest the truffle paremsan fries above anything else! This is a must have on your las vegas trip!"}
{"text":"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:  Chanterelle Burger- I had high expectations for this. I mean, chanterelles and figgy-onion jam?! Unfortunately the first bite had me on that so-so line.  It felt like I was biting into another sort of standardized burger that had cool components to it.  The patty itself didn't yield a good beefy flavor and I felt as if all I tasted was the figgy-onion jam.  The buns were dry and while I asked my burger to be cooked to medium, it was well-done.  Euro Burger- Truffle essence was certainly there and thankfully this was cooked to the medium as request.  This made such a huge difference overall on flavor and juiciness.  The oven roasted tomato was a nice addition and the goat cheese added a nice creaminess to each bite.  Shake #4- The oreo shake itself was delicious, but I personally think it could've used more oreo throughout.  The creme brûlée pudding was rich at its richest and this is the first time I've had a shake with a layer of creme brûlée pudding.  It was delightful and certainly fixed my sweet tooth.  Roasted Jalapeno Popper- The first one I bit into was the \"one fiery surprise\", but I am a spice head and didn't quite find this one spicy at all.  My friends on the other hand thought this was pretty darn spicy.  The flavor on these were just ok, nothing that left a good memory.  OVERALL:  This place wasn't what I had expected it to be. Do I regret coming here? No. But would I come back here again? Probably not.  Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review- I love burgers. LOVE them. I would marry one if I could marry a food product. I've probably eaten hundreds of burgers over my lifetime and am on the perpetual quest for the BEST burger. With that said...   I was expecting so much more from Mr. Ramsay (especially after waiting for an hour- thank goodness for YOLO! down the way in PH). I normally don't have expectations (this way you're never disappointed!)... but after seeing him on TV... I expected this to be an AMAZING burger. It was good... but not GREAT. The hubby and I split the Farm burger and fries. Fries were yummy... loved the sauce... but all in all... wasn't my favorite burger of all time.   Overall- Gave it an 8."}
{"text":"We decided to try this gourmet burger place at Planet Hollywood for lunch on a Monday and to say we were pleased was an understatement.  The location is not far from the valet and easy enough to find. There was a small wait to get seated, which on a Monday afternoon was a good first sign. The space was large with plenty of table and lots of trendy colors. The staff was attractive and very welcoming.  The table set up and quality of the silverware made me forget this was a burger place and not a nicer steakhouse.   The drink menu was displayed on an interactive iPad left by our server. You basically click a tab and tap the drink and you get a full description. Every milkshake had a specialty pudding and cookie; making them more of a dessert than a drink but definitely worth trying. I was a little disappointed with the lack of options but we had the banana shake and it was fantastic.   For appetizers we had the jalapeño poppers and onion rings. The onion rings were beer battered and very light. I didn't love them but the rest of the group was impressed. However the poppers were excellent! Presented in individual serving glasses with dipping sauce they were full of flavor and one had an extra kick because the chef leaves the seeds in it as a surprise.  We were very impressed with this presentation and preparation.  I had the farm burger with bacon and a fried egg and we decided to share the Tuscan fries. My burger literally bursts in my mouth. The egg exploded over the rest of the burger on the first bite making it a fantastically flavored burger. And the burger's preparation was very unique, perfectly charred on the outside with the perfect amount of pink in the middle.   Overall food wise this place was a hit and for the price of about $30 per person it's perfectly in line with the other gourmet burger places in town.   Luckily, the food was NOT the best part of this experience. The staff really steals the show. Not only are they all young trendy and beautiful but very knowledgable about their product. Our glasses were never empty. We never had to ask for anything and always felt taken care of.  The management just \"gets it\". The manager came over to check on us a few times, despite them being busy.  She took the time to explain how the state of the art grill works and asked us about things they can do better.  When I mentioned we have eaten at some of the other similar places in town, she wanted to know how they compared. I trust it wasn't pandering as she spent a great deal of time with us and seemed genuinely interested in our opinions.    The manager and the staff made us want to come back and established a new go to place to bring out of town guests for a delicious burger experience.   Highly Recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Planeando el viaje a Las Vegas cheque los lugares de Gordón Ransai y pasamos a comer a este lugar, fue rápido ,el menú Me encantó  la presentación de él está divertido,   así como la presentación de todos sus platillos..  Los precios accesibles. ."}
{"text":"This is a solid burger place on the strip. It doesn't pretend to be gourmet and it isn't. The toppings are a little different, but I was impressed the burger. I had the \"Hells Kitchen Burger.\"  It was cooked perfectly and the bun was fantastic. I think it was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't.   The place was packed for lunch on a Thursday afternoon, which is a good sign, and we didn't have to wait at all.   My two negative comments are reserved for the fancy ketchup (just not good) and that they were constantly refilling my drink. I never even got passed the halfway mark, and someone was replacing it with a new one. Seemed incredibly wasteful to me.   All in all, it was a good meal. Food was good, service was attentive, and reasonably quick.  The price is a little high, but it's the Strip so you have to expect it.  I will certainly return."}
{"text":"Amazing burger. I came here to specifically to try the Gyro and the Hell's Kitchen burger. I can't really describe how or why, but somehow the burgers taste better than anything I have ever had before (as far as burgers go). I'm somewhat baffled by how they can make it taste so good.  There was very little to complain about except for the price, but I don't review based on price."}
{"text":"Such a delicious burger! On a busy Wednesday night they kept the long line moving very quickly. We ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and the one w all the cheeses! The truffle fries were delicious. A touch too much truffle oil in the aioli would be the only item less than 100% perfect! I will be returning to this restaurant as there are several more things I want to try!"}
{"text":"Food was great, after we finally received it. We ordered Pork Bao buns to start then ordered fries & a burger to split and share.  We were served all three items at the same time almost one hour after placing our order.  We told the server we were in a hurry when we sat down.  Instead, her service was less than stellar though the food was good even though we had to rush & gulf it down as to not be late for our show appointment.  After we were presented with the check, we signed and completed the transaction.  I then ordered two to-go shakes. It took 30 minutes to receive. Not only did it take 30 minutes from the time we placed the order, the server charged me $69.00 for two shakes. She then presented me with a new check for $19.00 saying she credited my credit card for the $69.00.  After reviewing my bank accounts, she charged me for both $69.00 and for the $19.00.  There was no credit issued whatsoever.  Our entire dining time took one hour and 30 minutes.  I give the cuisine: 9  For the service....appalling!   Even a \"1\" is way too generous!"}
{"text":"Great Farm Burger, this is a must. Also the sweet potatoe fries are to die for...  they are AMAZING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We barely had to wait which was awesome. Must have came at just the right time. Usually there is a fairly decent sized line to get in. We were seated and given menus with Gordon Ramsay's face on it. It was a little funny but it was cool. We decided to split onion rings with cheese and truffle fries. The onion rings were so good. You didn't get that one bite and the whole onion comes with it, it was the right texture that an onion ring should be. The sauces that came with it were great, BBQ sauce, cheese sauce. Both were pretty darn good. With the truffle fries they were tasty but a little greasy and soggy after a while. However the sauces were an aioli and ketchup which accompanied the fries well.   Now on to the main course. My girl got the duck bacon burger which comes with a fried egg on top. That burger was bomb, a very tasty burger indeed. However my burger feel a little short. I got the hog burger. It's a pork burger and I have to say they should rename it to the \"Pho Burger.\" It tasted like a bowl of pho. I was really disappointed by that because I could have saved half the money by getting pho at a Vietnamese restaurant. My other friend got the same burger and said it did taste like pho. I mean it had good flavor and was tender but tasted like pho.   The sticky toffee pudding push pops were forgettable. I've had the real thing at his restaurant in LA and it was WAY better. Everything else was worthy of a 4 star review but overall it's 3 for me this time around. Good thing my girl filled up on fries and onion rings and gave me like half her burger to save this review. The fries, onion rings and duck bacon burger were on point. Sticky toffee pudding push pops and pork burger you can go without. If you are spending that much money, it's not really worth it for those particular items on the menu. Staff was friendly tho."}
{"text":"I had the Hells burger and it was great.   Onion rings were not crispy enough and seemed very salty I will not order those again and try something different.   Like a lot of others have said it takes a long time to get your order about 45 min!!!   Decor is neat and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a burger, even for this Vegan! Their portobello mushroom burger was very delicious! I also had their hummus appetizer served with non traditional veggies - yum! Quick service even during a busy time."}
{"text":"Food was good. Big portion with fries.. 2 can share. Jared was very helpful with my food allergies and all. Great meal."}
{"text":"We arrived in Vegas and got our rental car after 9 pm so we were starving but my daughter recommended this place and the line was long, an hour wait.   But it wasn't too bad as we got seated in less than an hour as the line moved quickly.  We started out with a farro-quinoa and chicken salad which had two grilled chicken skewers, faro, red quinoa, cucumber, avocado slices, kale, pine nuts, feta cheese and light lemon vinaigrette which was very tasty, crunchy and delish!  Then the truffle parmesan fries came with chipotle ketchup and truffle aioli yummmy!  We had the Britannia burger and the Chanterelle burgers!  Both equally delish and worth the wait!  I even bought a Burgr tee shirt for someone's birthday!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, a bit pricey even considering the location but ultimately, the burgers fell a bit below high expectations (Farm Burger and Euro Burger). If you're familiar with the LA burger joints, here's a list of places with a clearly better burger (in no particular order):  1. Umami 2. Tuning Fork 3. Father's Office 4. Pie N' Burger 5. Local Peasant  So after waiting 30 minutes to get a table and then waiting a bit too long for our burger to be delivered, along with a high bill, we left satisfied and happy we went... but a bit underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Decent burger joint and the price isnt bad. I think its only famous because its Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. There are way better burger joints in Vegas. Service was great but the wait time was too long. My burger was fine but the truffle fries was cold and hard. No flavor whatsoever."}
{"text":"The fries looked good but when I bit into them they were tough.  The onion rings were burnt.  The food was not worth what we paid."}
{"text":"Truffle fries? Nom nom nom. Any kind of fried anything? Yum! Just go for drinks and fried stuff.  Fish and chips - so juicy and the breading tastes almost sweet. Onion rings - crispy and yum.   We ended up ordering a lot of appetizers and a lot of sides, and everyone loved their food. Not many burgers were ordered, which is ironic because the name of the place IS BurGR. The waitstaff was super chill and fun. The wait to get in was maybe 10 minutes on Saturday night."}
{"text":"What a burger! My favorite burger was Zinburgers in Tucson. BurGR in Las Vegas has now become our Gold standard. First off, our server Karlenda is a pro. This woman knows her product knowledge. Gordon you need to put her in a trainer position. She should be training your new staff how to make recommendations.  The Burger was the best Ever. All the components complimented each other.  Cant say enough about our meal and Karlenda"}
{"text":"We've had the burgers here a couple of visits now and have enjoyed them and the warm hospitality. We've tried the Bleu cheese, hog burger, Euro burger and a few others and they were all excellent. Not too huge, just right sized. Share the Truffle Parm fries and you won't be too bloated to party for the rest of the evening! A nice collection of unusual draught beers as well."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype was about, but this place was definitely overpriced, rather bland, and what is with the wait on the line to get seated, to order,  to get your food?!  Alrighty. 2 stars.   I applaud them on their seating system. If you're a party of 3 or more, you stand in one line,  if you are a party of 2 or less, you're in another. The turnover for 2 or less is much faster. Don't be crabby. It's a long wait.  Service is friendly,  kind of slow because it seems like they give 1 server what feels like 10 tables. It's probably because everyone gets seated at the same time, get their food at the same time, and leave at the same time. It was a long wait to have the server come take our order, to get our food, and to get our check.   Food in itself, don't get the truffle fries. I love truffle fries.  This was regular fries with what appears to be a drop of truffle mist on the fries. It was more parmesan fries than anything else. The ketchup and garlic sauce was good. I can't even remember what burger I got. It wasn't memorable, but I took a picture of it.   Lastly, not sure on what the theme is, but why are all the female staff required to wear a hideous skin tight one piece dress that barely covers their crotch? All women are beautiful.  Please don't subject your female staff to wear a hideous uniform that hugs all the wrong places."}
{"text":"Just returned from having a great tasting American Burger, along with parmesan fries.  At first, it appeared as though there would be a very long wait, but it turned out to be about 10 minutes.  The fries were ok, nothing to write home about.  The burger was very tasty and grilled to perfection.  I was a little surprised that a plain order of fries were not included with the burger, so expect to pay an additional $9+ for fries.  The service was very attentive and I would go back in a flash."}
{"text":"I saw this establishment when I flew in for work and was looking for some burgers for dinner. Turned this app on and Viola!! BurGR, by Gordon Ramsay. So we give it a go.  Fries are out of this world!!! Specially the Truffle fries. The burgers were good, but isn't the best I've ever had. Sorry guys. That being said, I would probably come back here to try the other burgers or maybe some of the appetizers. They look amazing. (\",) happy eating!!!"}
{"text":"Sticky Toffee Pudding!!! Garlic Fries. good stuff!"}
{"text":"It was a 2 hour wait, so we have to walk around and come back. They get  your number to send you a message when your table is ready which was cool.  Their service: There service was great, the hostess tried to talk to us a little bit and asked if it was our first time, and thank us for waiting, and ask where we are from and all that, our server was great too, he came to check up on us here and there.  The appetizer: We had the pork belly bun, it didn't look great but the taste was good.  The burger: I had the duck/bacon burger which I think was okay. My bf had the big hot dog, i forgot what it was called but I have a picture of it. I didn't finish my burger, I only had half of it and took the rest home, if it was that good i would of finish the whole thing and not leave any left over.  OVerall i didn't think it was what i expected maybe i had a higher expectation because it was one of Gordon Ramsay restaurant, but i wouldn't mind coming back to try other food because maybe the ones i tried didn't make me satisfied."}
{"text":"All the stars go to the food but I'll never be back. Their check in system is a mess.   Check in: parties of 2 or more can go directly to the host and they are SUPPOSED to text you when your table is ready. We had checked with them at 45 min, and they said we were still on the waiting list.  After an hour, I approached again and they said my name was called and since we didn't show up our table was given away. I asked them what was the point of giving our number if they can decide to call our name out loud. It doesn't make sense. They didn't have an answer but claimed that probably their text didn't go through, but not true I received the initial text (see photo). We stayed because we had waited so long that. Thankfully, they did fix a table for us fast.   Food: Get the truffle fries and shake number 4. Fries are big enough to share between 2 or even 3 people.   Bottom line: Be careful with their dumb check in system. Any place on the strip could care less about your bad experience. It's a tourist place so they know  they'll never see you again."}
{"text":"While the service and food was amazing! I give four stars only because the Burgr was by no means the best part of the meal.  For an appetizer I tried both the jalapeño poppers and chicken wings, both of which were quite tasty! I do not recommend the truffle fries, as mine were nearly drenched in truffle oil.  Also, I do not recommend the Hell's Kitchen Burger because it doesn't feature the Duck Bacon... However the dessert was extremely tasty ! I shared the 3 restaurant sampler which features a shake from Burgr, as well as two separate desserts from Ramsay's other two restaurants in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I've watched your show many times (Hell's kitchen and nightmare kitchen ) so I decided to try out your recipe. Had that Britannia burger? Awesome, that was a . I liked they way they cooked and very presentable ... To me that was A plus.  The ambience is very cool and nice. Very clean environment , nice utensils, beautiful waitresses and waiters an A Plus too. But only the tables are small,what if you order more than one dish? Where are they gonna put the rest of the foods? It's just like tables are only for the petite /small peeps"}
{"text":"My 15 year old son adores Gordon Ramsay so he wanted to go to Burgr for his birthday.  I ordered the burger with goat cheese arugula and truffle mayo.  We ordered three sides including onion rings, buffalo wings and of course the Truffle Parmesan fries.  Service was good but rushed enough that our waitress got my son's order wrong. Said no veg on the burger and she heard it as \"lettuce.\"  Letting that one slide.  Anyhow all the food was great except for the wings which were disappointingly pedestrian.  Will go back again when the craving hits me.   TLDR:  Burgers cooked exactly as desired with rich beef flavor.  A burger worthy of GR'S name.  Truffle Parmesan fries luscious and a must have here.  Skip the wings.  Service is very good for an upscale burger place.  Don't worry about the wait if there is more than 2 in your party; they will text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here. Boy...was everything good. The waiters there are all good looking and thin. Lol Anywho..the food was yummy. Was here with my sis and we shared maui onion rings, farm burger, and the fresh roasted chili dawg. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"SKYDIVE. That's all I've got to say  anyway, I've experienced the most amazing customer service here! The food was fantastic! The only downfall was the jalapeño poppers drenched in the ranch for one person DEFF ask for it on the SIDE! My burger was lacking some love so I added avocado! However overall loved everything!! And the sticky pudding pop was good but deff better at his pub and grill restaurant(:"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Ramsey and I was so fascinated I was in his restaurant. However, got the farm burger and kept trying to convince myself it was special, but really, it was just a normal beefy patty with bacon and eggs. Compared to Umami burger, I was dissapointed. $15 for a burger I can make myself :p"}
{"text":"So, truth be told, I really want to smack GR right in his super-egotistical face.  And his face was everywhere in this joint.  But I went here for food and not for smacking Gordon's gob, and I was very impressed.  I went around 1:of pm for lunch and the line was long but the staff was efficient at seating people quickly.  In fact, the staff seemed very good at taking care of the customers, which surprised me because the place had a kind of \"fast food\" decor to it.  But my waitress was bright, friendly, and helpful with suggestions, and whoever passed by and saw I needed a refill on water or soda or needed a plate bussed took care of it there and then!  That alone was amazing; talk about teamwork.  Why can't more restaurant s do that?   Oh yeah.  Food. Jalapeño poppers were crispy and just the right amount of hot, and came with a wonderful dipping sauce.  The spices in the coating were delicious.  The onion rings are also a must-have.   I had the farm burger which was above-average, cooked exactly as I had asked for it.  The coffee milkshake was hard to put down, very thick and smooth, with intense chocolate layer on top of coffee.  Worth the trip all by itself.   Prices were very reasonable, and you can use a total rewards card to get a dollar off each item.  Portions were large, and food was so rich that it left me feeling stuffed."}
{"text":"Great food at a very reasonable price! Took my brother here when he came into town and the service was really great, sure the wait was a bit much, but they give you a pager so we just played the slots until our table was ready. We LOVED the milkshakes, super silky smooth and sooooo rich! The burgers were very tasty. We usually like sweet potato fries more than normal fires but this was not the case here, the french fries were pretty good especially the dipping sauce! It was very nice to be able to afford a celebrity chef's restaurant without having to spend our life savings haha ;)"}
{"text":"First off i seen the shows top chef and  hells kitchen and i admit i dont watch or like the shows  But i figured at least try the food   I ordered the gordan ramsey burger which is a secret item not on the menu  The told me it has all the ingredients of your usual burger with bacon but i cant i eat pork im allergic to pork so i almost said no to this burger until she said no its not pork bacon its DUCK BACON lol i said what ok lets try it ,  To make a long story short , I hate i did not buy two....that burger haunts my dreams lol god its good...."}
{"text":"I have been here several times but this most recent visit was definitely 5 stars and that is primarily due to the awesome staff and their really great service.  I was by myself and had mentioned that I was hoping to watch the UFC fight that was showing so I sat at the bar further inside that is actually in front of the kitchen. Shortly after being seated, one of the managers came over and offered me a table in a better area that was facing the TVs in the restaurant.  I thought it was so nice of him to move me, especially when you know the lengths the line usually gets out the door!  My server, Amanda, was also really great.  She and another server kept coming by to make sure I had enough water and that I was taken care of.  Everything was so personalized and courteous, it felt like a special occasion!  I ordered the Skinny Screw cocktail, American burger and their delicious sweet potato fries.  Those things are amazing!  They were a little overcooked so the dipping sauce and powdered sugar did double duty this time. Overall, a very friendly atmosphere and outstanding service."}
{"text":"I went here thinking that it was just another upscale burger joint, WRONG ! The menu was straight to the point, told you exactly what you were ordering and the prices were fair for a Gordan Ramsay restaurant. The food was awesome I had the Farm Burger, duck breast bacon, over easy egg, cooked to perfection just the way I ordered it which leads  me to the service I received. Our server, Alex with the glasses, was the BOMB he was on point with the service he provided me and my family. He gave us plenty of time to order and answered all questions we had about the menu, he knew the menu front and back and had us tasting the food without actually eating it. He kept are glasses full and checked on us regularly making sure everything was as it was suppose to be. I cannot give Alex enough credit because this was New Years Eve and he was extremely busy with all his customers and yet took a little extra time to converse and joke with my family. The food was great ,but the service was better props to Alex and the general manager for the staff he has at his restaurant. I will definitely be back with my family in the future and be sure to let others know to ask for Alex with the glasses for excellent service when they visit this place."}
{"text":"The line to get seated was over an hour and a half wait during Sundays lunch hour so we to-go'd our food which took about 25 minutes. We got two burgers, one fries & one coke which came out over $40. Pricey for a burger meal? Yes but if its worth it who cares right?   As we both like Gordon Ramsey we were looking forward to our meal. I had the recommened Hells Kitchen Burger ($14) cooked medium rare & my bf had The Farm ($15) cooked Medium; it's a \"duck breast bacon\" patty (had a tad more flavor than my beef patty). But generally speaking, both patties LACKED FLAVOR. So the thick buns with a flavorless patty made an overall flavorless burger for the both of us. If the patties had more juicy beefy flavor/marinade it would be much better. And i didnt really like the roasted jalepeno peppers mixed in with my burger, didn't compliment my taste buds well. Good thing I had a nice cold soda to wash down the dry burger. For representing Gordon Ramsey's name and the price, you will definitely expect more from a flavorless burger that will result in a huge dissapointment.  So I dont understand y there were so many ppl waiting in line And whoever raves about their juicy, flavor-explosive burgers must be their first time eating burger patties or wanting to follow the crowd. Not coming here again. C'mon Ramsay!!  *Side note* If you have their Total Rewards Card (players card) everything is a $1 off from the menu. But you need to have the actual card present with you."}
{"text":"First off let me say this, I think restaurants owned by A list chefs are overrated. With that being said, this place was fantastic.  I played it safe by ordering the Farm Burger, which consist of duck bacon and a fried egg. Did I like? Definitely but i wish I was more adventurous. This burger was very pleasant as the saltiness of the duck bacon complemented the rest of the burger. Also the egg yolk helped add more depth to texture and flavor.   I also had the best shake that I have every tried, the creme brûlée with the oreo on top. I dont know if they still have this, but it was definitely worth all the money.   The truffle parmesan fries were recommended by my waitress but I felt it wasn't too great. It was good, not great. I would of rather tried another side dish.  Worth it? Yes, but if your welling to spend around $15-20 for one burger plus some for side dishes and a shake (recommended in my opinion). The ambiance was pleasing to me and I sat near the open kitchen. It's a sight to see and smell.   Service was excellent, and it should since its Gordon Ramsay.  Make sure to head out early because there will be a line!   I was satisfied with the food, service, ambiance.  Dont Knock it, til you try it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The service was fast. Service was fantastic..The burgers is to  die for.. best burgers in vegas. Try the truffle parnesan fries so so good..."}
{"text":"A bit of a line up (they don't take reservations for small parties). We waited about 45 minutes for a seat/table even though tables were not all filled and this was roughly around 6:30pm. I guess they do this so they don't over pack the place. I ordered the Fois Gras/Truffle burger on Medium cook along with the Green apple kale/romaine salad. Both were tasty and delicious ... but when the \"just fries\" came out, it wasn't that great. They over cooked it and so chewing the fries were not that pleasant at all. I didn't bother to complain as it was just a plate of french fries, but I would have expected better for the price your paying for a burger with fries. My bill was around $60. Overall, food was good , service was ok as they are super busy and had to try to locate our waiter to pay the bill ... I would give it another try again if I stay at the Planet Holleywood on my next stay, but i'm not dieing to eat here right away. I'd like to experience other burger places."}
{"text":"Gordon takes burgers to a whole new level at BurGr. I tried both the Hell's Kitchen and the chicken burger. Both were phenomenal. Both meat patties were seasoned to perfection and were juicy. I also would highly recommend the Parmesan truffle fries. I will definitely return to BurGr on my next trip to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised to read some of the negative reviews about this place.. I absolutely loved it! I used to watch Hell's Kitchen all the time and have always wanted to go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.. When we first put our name in they told us it would be about an hour but it only took 10-15 which was a nice! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and devoured every bite.. So yummy! My friends all enjoyed their burgers as well.. We also ordered Onion Rings and the Parmesan Truffle fries-- so good!! My cocktail was really delicious too. Can't remember the name but it was one of the specialty ones with Gin.. I would definitely come back here and eat again next time I visit Vegas.. It wasn't too expensive compared to some of his other restaurants I'm sure.. Yum"}
{"text":"If you want a taste of celebrity chef food with a price anyone can afford, I'd highly recommend this place.  We had a group of maybe 10 people.  We saw the long line of people waiting to get in for dinner and inquired at the host stand.  We were going to have a long wait for a table that size, but we wouldn't have to stand in line any longer, they'd text us when they were ready, and we were free to gamble and drink elsewhere in the casino while we waited.  Roasted Jalapeno Poppers 5/5 - Best I've had.  Each are good sized and come in their own shot glass with dipping sauce.  I'm glad I tried these.  Truffle Parmesan Fries 4/5 - Pretty good, plenty of them, easy to share  Farm Burger 5/5 - Duck Breast Bacon, Sharp English Cheddar, Fried Egg...that truly says it all."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, seeing all of his cooking shows on food network, however this was not to the level I expected. The food was fine, but nothing special which made it extremely overpriced for what it was. Plus, the restaurant menu and decor were nice except for the fact there was huge pictures of Ramsay on both. I had the farm burger and onion rings. I'd say you could find a better burger in Vegas...though the onion rings were pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Beer selection was alright, not impressed considering the pairing possibilities with a great burger.   Ordered their truffle Parmesan fries and was disappointed by that.  It was stale and Taste and Felt like they were re-cooked or something.  Server was awesome  I'll be back BURGR"}
{"text":"Honestly more of 2.5-3 stars, but rounded to 3 because I think 2 is a bit too harsh for my overall experience at this restaurant.  Between my brother and I, we got the farm burger each, truffle fries to share, and also a beer each, which equated to about $60 without tip. To spend that much and go to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, I would expect my mind to be blown. However, the farm burger was very salty, which was immediately observed by both my brother and myself and although I understand fries are generally on the more salty side, these ones were beyond salty.   Our server was kind and the experience overall with the ambience and service wasn't terrible, but I just expected so much more with the food. If you're feeling bougie and want to do something just for the \"experience\", this is the place for you, but don't expect your taste buds to be out of this world."}
{"text":"Excellent Burgrs and service. The waitstaff were all very professional and the ambiance was very relaxing. The food was exceptional as well.  The burger patties and toppings were proportional to the bun. The patties were cooked to order and not over done. Which was perfect since we ordered medium on the Euro burger and rare on the Farm burger.  Chef Ramsay lives up to his professionalism once again.  Thank you Chef for a unforgettable burger experience."}
{"text":"This place was a let down.   Service was iffy (not at all what you expect from the Hell's Kitchen guy)  The hostess was a complete b word (I somewhat understand since she has to deal with annoying people all day, but THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE HIRED FOR)   we ordered the American, Farm, and truffle fries. I really enjoyed the American, the truffle fries- not so much. They were basically crap French fries with a ton of Parmesan cheese on it. The ketchup was also beyond disgusting  And apparently you have to speak really loud because the waitress didn't hear my wife say \"farm burger\" so we had to wait until I was half way done with mine before she finally got her burger.   Terrible experience that unfortunately cost $80  Never going back again"}
{"text":"I can't say anything stood out taste wise, but it was certainly pretty presentation. Honestly didn't even like the taste of my burger (I would say In&Out probably tasted better). I had a bite of the dirty dawg, it was good but way too salty. We ordered a few appetizers to share and they were good. But again, nothing super stood out where you couldn't get at your local diner.   This is what we ordered: Wings: good, a lil spicy but good.  Truffle onion rings: good. It didn't taste too truffle though.  Sweet potatoes fries: okay American burger with a fried egg on top: not too good.  Dirty dawg: pretty presentation, a lil too salty."}
{"text":"When I heard the name Gordon Ramsay, I always set my expectation high. There was a long wait just to put your name on the list, so this must be so good. So once we got in, I decided to order the Hell's Kitchen Burger and truffle fries. They are good, but they don't meet \"Gordon Ramsay\" burger."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! There is always a wait so be careful on what time you try to go. I got a blue cheese burger and the parmesan cheese fries. The food was great prices are a little high but you are in Vegas on the strip! I also go a strawberry shake which was amazing! The fries you order separate from your burger. One fry could feed two or more people. I will go back when I'm in town! A must try!"}
{"text":"So...we show up on Cinco de Mayo and there was an hour and a half wait for a table.  We told them we just got married at the Cosmo and suddenly were told it would be about two minutes for our party of five.  Pretty awesome start.  But that's not the good part.  I was ambivilant.  But from our server, to our cocktails, to our meals and the champagne provided gratis by the manager - everything was top notch.  Started with a great server - wish I could remember his name but he got married last September so I hope you know you are - who gave us some recommendations for cocktails.  We chose the Jalenpeno Ritas.  Oh my gosh.  FABULOUS.  Like the Best.Cocktail.Ever.  We ordered the jalepeno poppers (Incredible), the Vietnamese app (first time for anything like this for me and WOW), and the onion rings (homemade like everything else and done so well).  Nothing wasn't delish.  And then the burgers.  My new husband had the Euro Burger which he described as the best burger he had ever had.  And that's something since he's had A LOT of burgers.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  Deliciousness.  We are so glad my Man of Honor suggested this as an alternative to Mexican Food on our special day.  It really couldn't have been better."}
{"text":"My first time trying BurGR was at an Elite event last year.  We were lucky enough that night, to try the majority of the menu.  It was all amazing.  My table quartered the burgers so we could try different ones.  My faves were the Britannia Burger and the Euro Burger.  I didn't care for the Sticky Toffee Pudding Pop.  Cool idea but I could do with less salted peanut ice cream.  Recently I went back again with a friend from out of town who was staying at Planet Hollywood.  I got the Uber Cheese Burger  and the #4 shake.  My friend got the Farm Burger, #5 shake and we shared Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Everything was just as good as the first time.  We didn't have to wait long for a table and service was attentive.  Prices were average for a celebrity chef restaurant.  I only wish it wasn't such a pain in the ass to get anywhere in Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"I really didn't have high expectations walking in, I was planning on overpriced BS that was all fluff and no substance. I was mistaken. The shakes are like nothing I've had before! Burgers have a certain flair that sets them apart, while keeping it a \"burger.\" Tried the truffle and the sweet potato fries, both were equally awesome! The price is not bad at all considering, I'm a cheap-ass and even I didn't mind the prices. Only thing that was unnecessary are the whore outfits that the girls have to parade around in, if this place is to present the impression of a high-end establishment, the girls should be dressed accordingly."}
{"text":"Prepare to get tantalized by Gordon Ramsay's BurGR! Featuring the all-American favorite sandwich with his own creative twist. With that said, be ready to wait for a table if you're with a big party otherwise, for groups of two or three people, you can wait in line outside the restaurant to get seated at the bar. The advantage of being located in Planet Hollywood is the fact that you can walk around the Miracle Mile Shops to kill time. As soon as your table is ready, you'll get a text from the restaurant. Convenient, don't you say?  As far as the food goes, here's what I tried:  The TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES were good. I wish the fries were thinner and crispier. It's just my preference. But flavor wise, especially with the truffle aioli dip, it's fantastic! An order can be shared by 2-3 people. $11 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#fu1M2DR5IoCGVupQGjmG3A  I'm such a fan of SWEET POTATO FRIES and Chef Ramsay did not disappoint. The honey jalapeno dipping sauce he paired with this was absolutely beautiful! The fries themselves were cooked perfectly, thin with a nice crisp... just how I like my fries! Again, plan to share, or not! $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#DBVUeVe3EfoRTIdWiKx6nw  The burger choices on the menu are not that many so I wanted to try them all if I could. I'm glad I have a family to eat out with because we can each get different things and share to get a taste of several items the restaurant has to offer. Take note that their burgers are grilled over apple and alder wood which is responsible for the smoked flavor aroma you'll sense in the air.   Per our server's recommendation, I went with THE HOG BURGER. Instead of beef, the patty used here is Mangalitsa pork which is an \"old-world heritage breed renowned for its rich, butter fat and flavorful meat.\" Topped with sharp cheddar, apple butter, and arugula, this burger is probably the healthiest among all the burgers on the menu next to the Earth Burger (no meat). The meat itself is overflowing with awesome flavors but the entire taste of the burger sandwich was a bit on the salty side for me. $18 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#jRL6Zjpomomxh9CsQXXMAg  I also had a quarter of my husband's FARM BURGER and this my fellow Yelpers,  is my favorite here! The beef patty was cooked to perfection and who doesn't like fried egg on their burger?! More importantly, topped off with duck breast bacon? All I can say is...WOWZA! $15 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#UKPej0Qj1CDjKSo7DSn1qw  If you like anything spicy then the famed HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER will be sure to satiate your palate. The roasted jalapeno poppers add a nice kick while the creaminess of the avocado gives off a silky sensation in your mouth. Oh and let's not forget the fried egg. It's probably safe to say I really enjoyed this. $14 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#s3YRX-KZ3dTR7nits2ZuQg  Lastly, my daughter ordered the EURO BURGER. I like goat cheese and almost anything with truffle, hence my adoration for this creation. Topped off with arugula and oven roasted tomato, this burger is a winner in my book. I highly recommend if you're a goat cheese fan. $16 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?selected=pxle_4AJBnqWpLLNXwyHvA#tu4w5YVMRHOp_qz91zGkAg  A burger meal is never complete without a milkshake. Our sugar fix was SHAKE #3. It's banana shake layered with butterscotch pudding on the top, then a snicker doodle cookie for that added crunch. Verdict? Deeeeeelightful! You'll literally go bananas over this one. $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#oeLyAQ8Jv2nNgVj90nJ5IA  SERVICE started off not-so-great but throughout our meal here, our server proved me wrong and showed our table genuine service. She patiently answered all our menu questions, took our chaotic order quite well, and made sure all our glasses were filled all throughout our stay here. And we did stay for quite a while.   If you're in town and tired of the buffets, this place is worth a shot!"}
{"text":"First of all, I freakin love Gordon Ramsay, I watch a handful of his shows (my favorite being Master Chef) and I'm a fan of his blunt and straightforward personality. That being said, I'm disappointed by the wait time for the table and the food.  Me and a group of 5 friends came during EDC weekend around lunch time. The hostess was very kind and told us that it would be a 30 minute wait and would notify me via text (that's so cool!). This was not a problem, I had a large group anyways. After about 30 minutes, I get a text but we wait another 15 minutes for our table to get set up.  After looking through the menu, I decide to order the farm burger (duck breast bacon?!?) and an order of truffle fries. What I've learned about watching Gordon Ramsay's shows is to be diligent and not to make your customers wait forever for their food. The funny thing is that we waited for almost an hour for our burgers and we only got one order of fries before the burgers (we ordered 2).  Granted, it was probably the best burger in my life I can't rate this place any lower than 4 stars because the service was commendable and the food was delicious. Just beware of the wait time if you're starving or in a rush!"}
{"text":"I just spoke with Michael the manager at Burgr after asking about Total Rewards and if they were accepted all day and he was great! Total rewards points can be used all day every day here. Thanks for a great time and for clarifying Michael!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to visit when in LV!  Highly recommend the truffle fries or the gooey fries!"}
{"text":"My First experience at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant (Gordon Ramsay Steak) was forgettable, so I hesitated to try another, but the great reviews on Yelp about Burger gave me the inspiration I needed to give it a try.  I have to report back that I should have trusted my own instincts instead of backing down to Yelp peer pressure. The restaurant is impressive looking, from the decor to the mini skirted waitstaff, but the food itself let me down.  Most of it was poorly cooked and or flavorless. My wife and I started our meal with beer battered Maui Onion Rings and these were actually the highlight of the meal for me. They come in a decent size portion for two people and I thought they were sweet and flavorful with a nice crunchy batter and a nice touch of Parmesan on top of them. They were served with a super thick but very good Cheddar Ranch Dip and an interesting but not great flavored smokey house Chipotle Ketchup. For her burger, Simone tried  a well done Chanterelle Burger with arugula, mushrooms and onion fig jam. At first bite you could taste the sweet onion jam and it was very good good but almost immediately it was overwhelmed by the taste of a burnt Burger. It was crunchy and definitely well done but in all the wrong ways and its texture was that of a dog biscuit.  I could not taste the mushroom at all.  The Burger was a waste of 16.00 dollars but after loading it up with as much of the jam as possible she reluctantly finished most of it anyways.  I ordered the famous Farm Burger medium and it was cooked correctly. It was topped with English Sharp Cheddar, duck breast bacon and a fried egg. This Burger also had no flavor. The meat needed some kind (any kind) of seasoning, and although I could see the bacon I could not taste it. I have had more flavorful bacon from the local grocery store. I'm going to assume there was cheese on it because I could see that also but again no flavor.  The egg that was supposed to add a nice creamy richness did nothing to save this burger. I could have made this better at home and had it a lot cheaper and with seasoning. To try and save the meal we tried  the much talked about bread pudding lollipops. These were good but not great. They were fancy looking with there layers of bread pudding and Ice Cream but they were a little dry. To summarize this meal I would have to say it was overpriced for the lack of quality. In my experiences, it seems you are paying for the name on the wall when you eat at any of Gordon Ramsay's places. I have tried two of his restaurants and been let down twice by the sub par quality. I will not be trying a third time."}
{"text":"I've been to BurGR multiple times and it is now a must see place for my family.  Amazing burgers, great staff, great selection of beer.  We look forward to going back every time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was poor after waiting 30 minutes, we waited an hour for our food with the waitress that kept telling us it would be out shortly. Manager stepped in and told us the kitchen had lost our order and comped our meal.  Food was very good and they did handle the issue but don't plan to return.  Chairs were uncomfortable and restaurant was very noisy."}
{"text":"The best burger I have eaten in my life at Gordon Ramsey's BurGR. Besides very simple, but quiet amazing menu, everything in this restaurant was done right, from the amazing dessert shakes to waitstaff uniforms. Simple, tastefully stylish and delicious. Gordon is not only a top chef, but a smart businessman. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Gordon Ramsey's BurgR. I took my boyfriend here on our last night in Vegas. He likes to think he's a burger connoisseur...so I decided to stroke his ego a little bit since we were celebrating our Valentines Day. We got there at about 7:30 right at dinner rush and as expected there was quite a line and a 35 minute wait. So we hopped in line and were seated about 45 minutes later. The ambiance was very chic with dim lighting and warm colors. Our server was awesome! She was super friendly and really seemed to love her job which really made the experience even better. We started out with the wings, which were absolutely delicious and cooked and sauced to perfection. They were probably my favorite part of the entire meal. My boyfriend ordered the blue burger and I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and we split them so we could try both. The burgers were also cooked to medium rare perfection. I was hoping for more kick from the Hell's Kitchen burger, so I actually preferred the blue burger. We also ordered the truffle Parmesan fries which were super amazing due to the truffle aioli. I really wanted to order one of their shakes, but by the time I had finished eating I was about ready to burst. I really enjoyed the entirety of this place and would recommend it to anyone looking to get a good burger quality burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"Verdict: Overall, not bad.   Service is great, but food is so-so. Also, we had to wait 2 1/2 hours when they said it would only take an hour and 15 minutes.   Would I come back?   Probably not. The food is what's going to keep me coming back as a regular, not the service. I had the Farm burger and while it was good, it wasn't anything special. The bread was slightly dense, the meat was a little under-seasoned and the flavor that I was expecting from the fried egg and duck bacon, just wasn't anywhere to be found.   And not to mention, after eating this burger, I was still hungry.   And if you're still hungry after reading this review; do yourself a favor and grab a burger some place else.   I'd bet 10 to 1 you'd love Bachi Burger over this spot any day."}
{"text":"Always busy, but we had friendly service, spotlessly clean environment, really good burgers and fries, and prices not bad for a celebrity Vegas restaurant. It is noisy, so be ready for that.  Don't be in a rush, in case there is a line, but once seated we were not rushed, though serve  time was efficient."}
{"text":"They had difficulty making a medium burger warm ! Fries were great  sorry Gordon the burgers are average at best"}
{"text":"Tonight I had the pleasure of trying the farm, euro, blue, and brittian burgers. The fried egg with duck breast bacon was good, but if you only have a burger with truffle aioli and goat cheese cheese once, you should have it here.  Our server Megan made all of the right suggestions."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!! So amazing.. That the boyfriend and I went twice in one day!!! Breakfast and dinner!! Breakfast-My boyfriend got the Euro burger medium well.. It tasted like heaven!! I got the Hells Kitchen Burger and no other can ever compare!!! Burger set the bar WAY UP!!  Dinner- boyfriend got the Euro Burger AGAIN (YEP THAT GOOD) I had the chili dog ... (Trying out the menu) and another bar setter! Ramsey took a hot dog and took it to a whole different level! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"What more is there to say that hasn't already been said? Yes it's Gordon Ramsay's, just go! Go if you are a fan, go if you enjoy burgers and mostly go if you would ever want a chance to see him. I asked our waiter and he said that Ramsay himself shows up about every 3 weeks. He did mention that there are about 200 people or so who also want a chance to see him-so now you know!  Other than that I do personally recommend that You order your burger medium RARE! The meat is as tender and juicy as it looks in the picture.  The jalapeño shots are a good group appetizer. Yes they are spicy-as they should be!  The order of fries and onion rings are big enough to share with someone else!  Another tip! Before you ever appear on one of his shows Make sure you learn how to cook a scallop and Wellington properly! :p"}
{"text":"The burgers are awsome the hells kitchen burger was great my wife had the chanterelle  mushroom burger it was incredible  my daughter  hot dog was like 15 inches long great atmosphere service great"}
{"text":"Food was great and service was fast and friendly. Hells Kitchen burger and truffle fries were my favorite."}
{"text":"Gordon mother effing Ramsay. Oh my lord, I was beyond disappointed. We ordered the hot pockets, hot dog, and three burgers to try. I've heard great things about this establishment and of course, have seen the reviews. I will say that it was absolute garbage. I just want to put Gordon Ramsay's head in between those two pieces of cardboard that he has the audacity to call burger buns and ask him, \"What are you?\" He will look down and say, \"An idiot burger.\" The burger was so dry that I had to scarf it down with water... Just like those hot dog eating competitors. The burger patty had no flavor and when you squeezed the burger there weren't any juices. It was a sign from the gods that it was a terrible burger. I also tried the truffle burger and it was so overpowering. Save your money and get something worth eating, In-n-out or Shake Shack for the mother effing win."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to tryjng the food here, the wait was great but the service was very slow. We ordered onion rings, fries, hot dog and hells kitchen burger.  When the food arrived the fries were cold. The burger was good...too big to finish. The hot dog my hubby had was really good! The server was slow on getting back to us. We skipped desert."}
{"text":"First impression: this place must be good, there's already a line and is not even open!  Atmosphere: Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.   And we had an iPad that showed us descriptions of our drinks... That was really cool. Which leads me to my favorite part of any restaurant establishment...  Alcohol: Best drinks in Vegas. Nuff said.  Food: We ordered burgers. Duh.  And they were good. We got the blue cheese burger and the chanterelle burger with truffle fries. I mean after eating at Guy Fieri's restaurant with his Mac and Cheese burger full of cheese love and gooey goodness, I appreciated the simplicity of Ramsey's  burger.  Although next time I've got to order that pork burger.  Service: Our waitress wasn't bad, but she wasn't amazing. She did her job and really there's nothing to complain about.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Not a quick burger joint. This is gourmet food at its best.  The jalapeño poppers are amazing and the truffle fries are as well.  But the real center is the burger, fresh, pefectly seasoned and well put together.  Worth the wait and worth the cost."}
{"text":"It was just OK, ordered the Turkey Burger and it was extremely dry. I know it is turkey, but I,'ve better Turkey Burger at BJ's."}
{"text":"Food was great and the blood orange martinis are soooo good. We went on a Sunday night and only had to wait like 20 min. And there were 4 of us. We took our kids with us and they enjoyed the wings and a burger."}
{"text":"Friday night 7:30 pm the strip in Vegas long lines for dinner.  Our favorite burger place had closed so it was off to find another, we found Burgr, and it is associated with Gordon, has to be a hit right? We were greeted by one of the many hostesses up front, she was extremely enthusiastic and let us know it would be about an hour, no problem, we gave our cell number to text us when the table was ready.  Off to the casino. They were very accurate with the time, an hour had passed so we decided to see how much long, a different hostess greeted me but this one was not to happy.  \"Yeah\" is how she responded when I went up. \"The time said 8:38 it's not 8:38 \". So waited 10 more minutes and the text came, We were greeted by the same short talking girl that directed the original hostess that greeted me to take us to the table. I didn't catch her name but she was very nice and delightful to speak with.  We were sat at the table and immediately greeted by the waitress, she was a very bubbly personality and walked through the drink menu with us.  The service was good, there are no complaints in this department at all.  On to the food: the 3 of us ordered the Farm, the Uber, and the Hells Kitchen. GREASY, BLAND, UNDERCOOKED burgers, we waited 2 hours so we just ate to get out.  The only taste on the burgers were the condiments.  Was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Oh Gordon Ramsay, is there anything he can't do?  My pal and I have started an annual tradition....1. Going to Vegas every fall and 2. Eating at a burger place the day we arrive. This year my friend's Food Network crush (come on, we all have one...) on Gordon Ramsay led us to BurGR. Hot off the plane, we headed over to Planet Hollywood.  After wandering around for awhile, unable to find BurGR, we asked someone...naturally, at that point we were practically on top of it. Duh.  After a short wait, we were seated. Our stripper I mean waitress came by and explained the menu to us. It's somewhat limited....burgers (duh #2), including chicken, pork, and portobello burgers, a couple salads, a couple hot dog choices, a fish sandwich...plus some apps, shakes, and fries. We wound up going with the Hell's Kitchen Burger and banana shake for her, and the Uber Cheese Burger (FYI, \"uber cheese\" = 3 different kinds) and chocolate shake for me. We ordered regular fries to share, which came with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup.  The shakes arrived first...ok, there is pudding on top of them. How can that be bad? A shake and pudding combined takes care of all kinds of girl needs. We were in love.  We also really enjoyed our burgers...the meat was of excellent quality and very flavorful.  Even the bun was good. The fries, however, left something to be desired....they were not terrible, but the burgers and shakes were so fab, we felt let down. The 2 ketchups were tasty, but the fries seemed like maybe they were sitting around for awhile? Which I find hard to believe, since they must serve fries all day long. So I guess if there IS one thing Gordon Ramsay can't do...it's fries. But we got over it.   We would surely go to BurGR again (duh #3)....I'd love to try some of the other burgers and shakes....however, we'd pass on the fries....the next table had an appetizer of onion rings, maybe we'd get those instead.   A very solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Really accommodating to families with kids. We ordered:  Maui Onion Rings (nothing special.  Yard House onion rings taste better than these ones)  French Fries (really bad steak fries)  Farm Burger (too dry, missing something)  Hells Kitchen Burger (best thing we had all night.  nice heat)  Probably won't be back because there are just too many better options in LV"}
{"text":"Since it's opening, it has become a must-do whenever we are in Vegas. Have tried 3 different burgers, all were amazing. Love the curry and chipotle katsups that come with the thick cut fries. Tried a shake for the first time on our last visit. It tasted delicious, but the pudding on top was an unexpected surprise. Expect a long wait at regular meal times. I always grab a pen at the end-- one more touch I love (twice our waitress brought more pens for us)"}
{"text":"Good burger, ok service. The first time we went, everything was great, service and food was good. It was worth it that we didn't mind waiting 2 hours for a table. The second time, however, we had the same waitress and she forgot our appetizers and she never came around after dropping our food off. Slightly disappointed but will go back because their burger are worth it."}
{"text":"Love the burgers and of course Gordon Ramsay!  They have really good sauces for the French fries. The ketchup has a hint of curry and it tastes good. Their shakes are pretty good too"}
{"text":"If you are a 7* or a Diamond player you can get next seating,, otherwise it's a long wait, which is why I rated in 4 instead of 5 stars.  The service and attitude from the minute you get there is friendly and upbeat. They actually seemed please you chose to eat there.  There were 4 of us and we each tried a different burger. The Euro was probably the best, though the jalapeño was a close second.  I like that they kept you change things (I added fried egg).  Wasn't too crazy about the fries or the sauces that came with them, but I like my fries thin and crispy. I don't eat sweet potato fries but everyone thought they were delicious.  Can be a long wait, but if think worth it. Not cheap, but not over the top like many restaurants in Vegas. Bon appetite"}
{"text":"I'm glad I came here an hour before closing time, that way I didn't have to wait in an hour line just to eat! **ALSO, if you're signed up with Total Rewards, you can shave a few dollars off your bill, free to sign up.***  Went up to the hostess and she told us to wait in line while they got our table ready which took 5 minutes. The only awesome decor that I see that they had set up were the flames 0.0 how I wish I was able to sit next to it. The place was a full house, busy and loud of course. I didn't realize that the menu was already placed at the table and was used as decor for the silverware. Nifty :-). The waitress took a while to greet us and didn't come fill our drinks once...   Couldn't decide on what to order just yet so we started with the parmesan fries which my sister and I were extremely disappointed in. They come out as steak fries which is not terrible, but when they come out soggy it's not enjoyable. The dipping sauces were delicious but it wasn't enough to make up for soggy fries.   Next up was the Hell's Kitchen Burger. We took this to go since we got tired of waiting for slow service and figured it'd be a better experience to bring it to our room to enjoy. Especially having some water to drink!  We went upstairs, turned on the TV. Much more relaxing.... They cut our burger into two cooked at medium rare... Nice and juicy the way I like it. First bite into it... O my... I was surprised how great it was. The ingredients all came together to have this tangy jalapeño beef burger. I wished I was filled up on fries so I would feel like a chubster wanting to eat the other half. Sadly it went to the sister.. I will definitely come back and try a few other things on the menu."}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  The promotional materials say that BurGR \"takes the traditional burger, fries and milkshake comfort food combination to an entirely new level,\" and that's not hyperbole.  We had the Uber Cheese Burger (3 kinds of cheese, fantastic gooey goodness), the Chicken Sliders (good sized, a little aggressively spiced) and the truffle fries (huge portion, more than enough for two to split).  Nothing disappointed, and it was enough food that we didn't finish the fries, despite our best efforts.  Our servers were both terrific: Gianna, who my date described as \"put-her-in-a-teacup-cute,\" and Alex, who knows his way around a beer list.  (On that note, the beer list here is not world-beating, but is passably broad and reasonably priced.)  The servers and host staff are decked out in form-fitting '60s-flight-attendant-inspired uniforms, which is a nice touch and good eye candy.  Easily a level above Holstein's at the Cosmo.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas this weekend and I remembered seeing the fire display while walking through the Planet Hollywood hotel and thought...why not? We went in and lined up for about 30min which was not bad even though it was Saturday and around 7PM. We ended up taking a bar seat and the service was very good. Our bartender was really nice and got our orders very quick and was attentive. We ordered the onion rings, regular french fries, the jalapeno burger and the american burger. The onion rings were probably the best part of the meal. The batter was very light and was very tasty (maui onion rings) and crisp! I was not really impressed with the burgers. It was tasty but nothing spectacular to want to go back to try again."}
{"text":"If Gordon Ramsay knew what was going on during our meal I'm pretty sure someone would've been fired.  Or is it really all for TV value?  I've been itching to try this place out because compared to Burger Bar which has been operating in Las Vegas for 10 years, has garnered 1800 reviews and 755 photos on Yelp... Burgr has opened for less than 2 years and already has attracted 1,500 reviews and 2,300 photos on Yelp.  I was intrigued.    We decided to drop by on a Monday at lunch time to avoid any waiting but our food took 40 minutes to come out.  If you wanna swing by during rush hours, make sure you order a bunch of appetizers already when you get seated.  It was a shame that service took forever because our server was very pleasant.  The fire display at the façade is gorgeous, and the atmosphere is bustling with noise, tv sports and gaming machines.  Not much of a date place, more for a group of friends/family who wanna chat or watch the games.  Their burger is good, smoky and more savory than your average American burger...but it is tiny!  If I were a big guy 1 burger here (that doesn't come with any sides) will not fill me up. If I were to pitch this burger platter with most burger plates I've been served, it would pale in comparison.  At least put some edible garnish on the plate or something.  Same with the chicken wings (which we ordered without any sauce for my lil guy).  Very poor presentation, although the chicken wings itself were fried perfectly and the meat was tasty even without any sauce.  It was also cool how they prepped the wings, they were wrapped on only 1 bone.  Reminded me of a chicken lollipop.   My fish sandwich said it was served with salt and vinegar crisps and I was expecting chips.  Instead I got shoestring potatoes that hurt the roof of my mouth when I bite into the sandwich.  Eaten alone, the crisps have a hint of vinegar but with the fish and sauce, it doesn't really add any flavor.  I would've wanted to have lettuce or more pickles to have texture and to contrast against the already fried fish.  The bun and the fish itself though was good.  This is how they keep their prices friendly... they keep the portions small and you have to order sides separately.  When you get your total bill, it's still large, especially when you order their $4 soda.  (And remember you'll need 2 burgers if you're a hungry dude).  Finally, when we bite into our fries they are hard.  Not chewy, not tough but HARD.  Hubby tells the server and the kitchen says sorry they can't serve a new batch because there was a problem with the whole batch and offered onion rings instead.  If they know there's a problem, why serve it?  Here's the clincher, the table right beside us gets served the same hard fries, they complain, opt for the onion rings and are as annoyed as we were!  What were they thinking?  That maybe some guests would think hard fries is a Ramsay thing?  That it's ok to serve crap if they don't complain?  Bad call guys, in the TV world, you would be fired.  And my last little beef is with their placemats.  They are made of a leather-like material that absorbs dirt, ink and most offensively, smell.  Have you ever had a whiff of plastic placemats that don't get cleaned very well?  If you haven't, they smell sour.  And it's not something you appreciate taking a whiff of for 40 minutes while waiting for food.  New placemats please, and don't mess up the fries."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Gordon Ramsay has been a busy man in Las Vegas, opening three restaurant concepts in three different hotels within about 8 months' time. His latest is his most casual and approachable - a burger joint within the Planet Hollywood hotel. Coming off of dinner the previous night at Gordon Ramsay Steak, this would be our second consecutive red meat meal from Ramsay.  The menu is very streamlined and focused here, featuring a handful of snacks/appetizers and about ten burger options. There isn't your build-your-own-burger type place, which is something I appreciate. Fries and a couple of salad and hot dog options round out the menu.  Farm Burger duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, fried egg (substitute regular bacon)  Hell's Kitchen Burger asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato  My dad went for the Hell's Kitchen burger while I went with the Farm. Disappointingly, they were out of the duck bacon, so regular pork bacon was substituted for it. I'd have to say the burgers were pretty well done, with a nicely-cooked pink center for the meat and a very soft bun. The meat had a subtle smokiness, nice char and was pretty juicy. My fried egg was cooked perfectly, with the yolk oozing out once broken. Considering the bacon and egg on the burger, this was about as close as I was going to get to brunch on this Sunday morning. I thought this was a pretty good burger.  Just Fries hand cut fries, chipotle ketchup, curry ketchup  These larger-cut fries were done well too, crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The housemade ketchups were quite good too. Simple but executed well.  I don't think any diner is going to be \"wowed\" here, but the food is actually quite good. The burgers, while simple, were thoroughly satisfying and cooked just right. And while we didn't try anything other than sides the french fries, those were just as satisfying. There are a ton of options to alleviate a burger craving on The Strip; I would consider BurGR one of the legitimate options."}
{"text":"I went here on Monday, 3/27/17. I ordered the \"Hells Kitchen Burger\" and fries. The presentation of everything was great! My burger was cooked medium, just as I had asked. The taste of the burger was nothing special. I was expecting to have a burger that would bust into my top 5, however, that was not the case. Everything just kind of tasted bland. I've had a much better burger at Applebee's and their burgers are nowhere close to my top 10. This is a cool place, I just wish that the burger would have wowed me even a little bit."}
{"text":"Great burger and wonderful service! The only thing I didn't do that I had the urge for, was to yell and scream and throw stuff around like Chef Ramsay does."}
{"text":"My party of 3 and I went on an early Sunday afternoon....around 1pm. What's weird is that for parties of 4+, you can check in at the hostess desk, give them your number, and they will text you when your table is ready. However, with parties of 2, you have to stand in that looooong line. That's.....different. But whatever floats their boat I guess. So we were quoted with an estimated wait time of 30 minutes. They were pretty accurate. In the meantime, we browsed around Miracle Mile Shops until we received a text from them.   Now on to the food. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs because along with our burgers, we got TWO orders of the parmesan truffle fries!!!! I definitely recommend just ordering one because the flavoring is very rich, so it may quickly get you full. For burgers we got (2) Hell's Kitchen Burger, (1) Euro Burger and (1) Blue Burger. You can request how well you want your burgers to be cooked. Wow...these burgers are delicious!! Also, what I love about gourmet burger joints are they make the perfect portion.  You won't get that \"oh my gosh...I feel so fat and bloated now after I just ate this big ass burger!!\" It will still leave you enough room for burgers, fries and maybe even dessert. We opted out on that...just not big dessert eaters, but those pudding pops sure looked good!! Even their shakes looked tempting.  Only reason why I rated 4 stars was the wait. So just word of caution: if you're starving and/or impatient....this will be your patience test.  Gordon Ramsey's BurGR will definitely be on our repeat list!"}
{"text":"When your expectations are high, the change that you'll be disappointed is higher as well. However, BurGR was a nice experience!   First of all we didn't had to wait that long, just like 20 minutes. The interior of the restaurant is not that special, and doesn't differs a lot from other restaurants (except from the firewall with 'fire-waves'. Our waitress was quite busy with other guests, so the service was not very fast.   I ordered the farm burger and truffle fries which were highly recommended at yelp and by the waitress. My bf ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, which was really a hell for his mouth, it was damn hot! Tasted very well, but be aware of the jalepeno peppers ;) the farm burger was nice as well. Unfortunately I ordered the burger medium and in the end it was served well done. Anyway it tasted delicious!   The fries were not that crispy as expected and mentioned on yelp.. But they tasted very well, the portion is enough for two persons! ;)"}
{"text":"I had the HOG BURGER, which we were told by our server comes out very pink but that it was ok even though there is pork in the meat.  Got the burgers, they were, OK at best. Not worth the money at all but no big deal.  The big deal came early the next morning when I awoke with food poisoning. I had to cut my Vegas trip short by 2 days because I was so sick.  Pretty pissed off. I wasted a lot of money, missed the concert I was there for, and threw my guts up for a burger that wasn't even very good. I won't go back,"}
{"text":"My Yelp boycott is over! I couldn't stay away...  Ramsay BurGR: Good. Not GReat. (Heh)  Service was excellent. Very informative, personable and authentic. Our server catered to our needs in every way. If I could review just based on service, it would be 5 stars.  The jalapeño poppers were lovely. They roast them before stuffing them which gives a nice soft sweetness while scorching your mouth with heat. The cheddar and bacon stuffing was rich and flavorful, though a little grainy.  My wife received her \"hell's kitchen\" burger at a perfect medium well, as she ordered. I received my \"euro\" burger at a perfect well done...as I most certainly DID NOT order. The server graciously apologized and brought a new one immediately cooked medium rare. No biggie. Things happen. But I still have to shave off a few points. Sorry Gordon!  \"Hell's Kitchen\" burger: very \"south of the border\" flavors which I found odd. Dry and unimpressive. Definitely could use some kind of sauce and some seasoning on the veg it's served with (avocado, roasted tomato and jalapeño).  \"Euro\" burger. I guess chèvre and truffle oil are considered euro. Either way it was a lovely combination. Though the goat cheese definitely overpowered everything after a few bites. I'd pay a few extra bucks for some fresh shaved truffles on there. This was a good burger, but nothing to write home about.  Truffle fries: over seasoned and weirdly textured. Definitely needed more crispness. The truffle came through in the aioli it was served with but not in the actual fries.  Ale battered onion rings: fantastic. Perfectly seasoned and crispy. Served with the same ranch sauce as the poppers and chipotle ketchup.  Lets talk about this \"ketchup\" for a moment. I'm all for homemade stuff, but those of us in the know (what a douche I am), are aware of ketchup really being a type of tomato jam and is often prepared in that way. The stuff we were served tasted like canned tomato sauce. No lie. It would've been better tossed in some pasta, not on my fries. If you're gonna do something that has pretty much been perfected by others (i.e., Heinz, Hunt's), it ought to be better than that.  The undisputed highlight of the meal was definitely the shake. We ordered the chocolate shake with salted caramel pudding layered on top. Best shake I have ever had. I don't what they do to make it taste so good, but good lord. What a treat!   Again, a good meal, but nothing special. They should take the burgers out, just serve the shakes and rename the place Gordon Ramsay SuGR. Bachi Burger is still, by far, my favorite burger place in Vegas. Seriously, if you haven't been to Bachi Burger yet, you really need to go."}
{"text":"When I got to Vegas, this place definitely had to be one of the places I needed to check out when I decided to explore beyond the tasty buffets (although I couldn't resist going to one as soon as I landed and checked in)  Nothing beats a big, fat, juicy hamburger after a night of drinking and gambling. Especially one with duck bacon and over easy egg. YUMS! This my friends, is the farm burger. It is a MUST TRY! My boyfriend ordered the earth burger without realizing it was a vegetarian burger (essentially a mushroom burger). We added on a patty and when the check came out, they charged us an extra 7 dollars for the patty...14 dollar burger and 7 dollar for a hamburger patty...someone please tell me how that makes sense??  My farm burger was also 14 bucks as well.   Besides the whole mishap the food is really good =). I will be back"}
{"text":"I came to this place hungry and drunk as a motherfucker and I still thought it sucked trumps orangutan balls. 21 dollars for a burger that wasn't any better than in n out. I asked for medium rare, received a dry medium well. I could probably cook a better burger dangled by my balls off the empire state building."}
{"text":"The burger was good. I just don't know how I feel about the onion rings that I received. There was a lot of excess flour that was not cooked properly. I informed the waitress and was told that the manager spoke with the kitchen about it. That was that and no apologies at all. Perhaps, food preparation and meeting customer's expectations isn't a big deal to management. :("}
{"text":"Great food and awesome service. Was only open 2 days back everything was great. This is a must for anyone on the strip. Fun, vibrant and upbeat place. Great selection of food and beer. Will be back again soon. I have never seen such great service. Gordon Ramsey knows how to do it right."}
{"text":"Been living in Vegas for over 9 months now and I kept walking by this place whenever I visited the strip and gave-in a week ago to try it out. I ordered a Euro burger and the truffle parmesan fries. While the burger was decent, the fries were actually pretty bland, even with ketchup and truffle sauce. The service though was pretty cool, so that brings it up a bit i."}
{"text":"Yes it's a burger, but yes, you will spend money. That being said, the burgers are pretty good. The jalapeño poppers were great and the service was outstanding. The quality of the ingredients was great, but in the end, it's still a burger. We ordered the chanterelle and Hell's Kitchen burger- chanterelle was better. The truffle fries were a bit dry, but tasted good. They do have a great beer selection(40 on tap) and an amazing cocktail menu. Worth a try for something with Gordon Ramsay's name on it."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. My new favorite place. I love the vibe I get from this place and I've never tasted a better burger in my life! This shits on Bobbys Burger Palace (still love you Bobby!)"}
{"text":"Era da tantissimo tempo che volevo provare uno dei ristoranti di Gordon e finalmente nella città che non dorme mai l'ho trovato. Premetto col dire che ne ha 4 sulla strip, dallo street food fino alla bistecca, e che io ho scelto come primo ristorante il \"burger\" perché non il più basso né il più alto dei 4. Ho apprezzato tantissimo l'antipasto con burger di ahi poke e la cottura del mio burger di tacchino, perfetto e morbido, insomma cucinato a regola d'arte. Buonissime anche le patatine con tartufo, abbinata un po' strana per un'italiana ma davvero molto buone. Come ambiente è sicuramente molto carino e curato, nonostante sia all'interno del planet hollywood che come hotel/casinó è davvero affollato, ma il ristorante riesce ad essere tranquillo al punto giusto. Divertente la cucina che dire a vista è dire poco, e praticamente in sala. Senza bevande e con un antipasto, due burger e una porzione di patatine abbiamo speso circa 60, in fondo anche poco! Grande Gordon! :)"}
{"text":"Huge Ramsey fan (thank you Hell's Kitchen) but also heard good things about this restaurant.   The meal did not disappoint. We both had the Euro burger: goat cheese, arugula, roasted tomatoe, aoli sauce...fantastic!!  I substituted the burger for a chicken patty, which was grilled the same was and still tasted great, and flatbread instead of the bun. Was trying to get less bread but turns out the flat bread is huge and thick. Nice because you get your money's worth but I wasn't the healthy meal I needed (breakfast and lunch were pretty heavy).  Definitely get at least the traditional 'Just Fries.' You don't need the fancy ones as they come with an amazing curry ketchup sauce. It also comes with a Chipotle sauce but that tastes exactly like Heins ketchup so just go for the curry, they will bring you more if you run out!  The burger is plenty filling. We were too full for dessert but they did look good. Afterwards we walked off our heavy meal at the Planet Hollywood mall.  Also, as far as Vegas meals go, not that bad for a nicer, sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"The line was a little ridiculous for a Tuesday evening for what turned out to be an alright burger. It was flavorful enough, but something about it was missing a gourmet flare.   Nice beer selection, though."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrid staff and slow. Save your money and sanity and go to In and Out!"}
{"text":"I just do not get it.  My first ever GR eatery of any kind, even though I am in Vegas once a quarter at least.  Maybe from watching him being over attentive to every detail on every show I have seen, this just was nothing more than an poor excuse for a Red Robin, no offence to Red Robin I think their product is superior to this.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  This was 2/3 fluff and 1/3 actual burger.  Maybe a 4 oz patty for $15.00 bucks, how about making the burger the star.  The cook on the burger was a perfect medium.  As  you see him do the burger failed the squeeze test no running juices, just kinda dry.  There just was not a lot of flavor from the actual burger, but the toppings were great.  I guess I was expecting a drip down my arm hunk of deliciousness for my money.  The truffle fries for $11.00 were the biggest disappointment.  These were nothing more than frozen steak fries with some cheese and truffle oil.  The house made condiments were okay the garlic was a little over powering.  Again thinking of the level this man can cook, and his external passion for perfection I was expecting more. Suggestion maybe some hand cut fries par cooked in a lower temperature, then finished in hotter oil to get that crispy outside with that almost mash consistency inside.   So if you want a celebrity restaurant experience with okay food for 30 - 40 bucks a person this is your place, but honestly there are 2 -3 better burger places within a 5 - 10 minute walk.  The wait was quick, even that you have to check-in to then stand in line? The service was great, the waiter was more than happy to make suggestions, and answer any questions we had.  So based on the service this is why it gets 3 stars, if not it would only be 2 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Starting with the awesome fire entrance to quickly being seated although they were clearly busy. Wait staff are friendly and fast. My refills and everything came without a wait sometimes. Erode I realized I needed it. Food is 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"As a fan of Gordon Ramsay I was very excited to try this place out.  I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was good. Was it the best burger I've ever had?  No, not by a long shot.  The fries were also good. Nothing amazing.  Best advice I can give is to not go in with high expectations due to the name."}
{"text":"Ordered shakes to go. After 30 min we went up to ask how much longer and we're told our order was lost and they could not find it in the system."}
{"text":"I walked in here to try out a burger, but after my best friend getting food poising from a burger the night before I changed my mind and got a salad instead.  The chicken noodle salad to be exact.  It was heavenly. It had avocado's, edamame, noodles, and other spicy things that made my mouth sing.  I was seated straight away at the bar - this could be because I was on my own which was great because I was on time restrictions being that I needed to fly out of Vegas that afternoon.  The guy behind the bar was lovely and attentive.   However I guess you come here for the food no? Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We wanted to come in for dinner on a Wednesday night at about 6:45, but the wait was about an hour and a half, so we went to Holsteins @ the Cosmopolitan and walked right in. Walking through the casino the next day at about 3:30, we were hungry and noticed there was no line, so even though we already had a great burger just the night before, we decided that a short twenty minute wait was worth it for a chance to try this place out.  I had no complaints at all. My burger was cooked to my liking, the bun, toppings, condiments, etc......all good. Some people have mentioned that their burger didn't have much flavor, I'd just say that it wasn't over seasoned. You can taste the quality of the meat underneath the seasoning. Fries were also good and the service was exactly what I expected.   I liked that they send you a text to notify you when your table is ready instead of making you carry around the big vibrating coaster, but you shouldn't have to wait very long for a burger in Vegas. As much as I enjoyed my burger, there is no shortage of high end burger joints in Las Vegas these days (many within walking distance of this very restaurant). I'd put this place near the top if I were ranking Las Vegas burgers, but there are burger places equal in quality nearby without the insane wait during peak dining hours."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. The service is impeccable and the burgers are fantastic. I've been here 3 times and I've had the American burger and truffle fries all three times. What can I say, I'm a creature of habit. The fries are so rich with the Parmesan cheese and truffle oil that just a few will do. Order a basket for your table to share and enjoy some of the other appetizers like the jalapeño poppers.   As a side note: be prepared to wait. Grab yourself a drink and enjoy the music because wait time is usually about 30 minutes to an hour."}
{"text":"The wait was about 25 minutes for lunch on Saturday. My fiancé got a $19 chef's special \"Gordon\" burger and was underwhelmed. I got the farm burger and wasn't impressed either. The fries seemed like they were fried and then refried. Shakes were super sweet and hard to drink."}
{"text":"Their Burger is really tasty, but it's not unique in my opinion within the gourmet burger competition. Therefore despite the heavy weight chef name of Gordon Ramsay, burgr was good but not worth the expensive price ($15 for just burger) to be paid for a typical gourmet burger I could get from a place like eureka! Plus the waiting at this establishment is atrocious. It took them 30 minutes to bring the burger to my table after I ordered, in which was too long in my opinion, since the average time for a gourmet burger place is 15 minutes at most places.   Now don't get me wrong, the farm burger was delicious, and it was gourmet, and I expected nothing less. But for $15 just for the burger, I expected more. Maybe a unique presentation, or even an umami taste that would send me out through the heavens as I sank my teeth into it. Instead all I tasted was the typical gourmet burger in which I could have enjoy at eureka!  The farm burger $15 topped with sharp english cheddar, a perfectly fried egg oozing with its yolk, plus the smokey yet not overpowering taste from the duck bacon was delicious. The loosely-formed patty blushed bright red and was juicy and cooked to order (medium rare). It was perfectly seasoned too, not too salty or bland. The poppy and sesame seed bun squished down to provide the ideal bread-to-meat ratio, and the toppings were complementary and clever. The burger was designed and clearly made with someone who knew what a gourmet burger should be. Despite the delicious taste of the burger, the taste was not special or unique in any way.  The presentation was utterly boring and lazy. It came on a huge square ceramic milky white plate, which made the burger seem minuscule in comparison to the plate size. Also to be noted, the plate had a warned out Gordon Ramsay Burgr logo. It absolutely lacked detail. I thought a nice wooden board or plate would have complemented it better and add an eaglet touch to it.   The just fries which was a la carte at $8 was beautifully presented in a conical shape and served with 2 unique sauces of chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup was certainly delicious and unique. The hand cut steak fries texture was perfectly crispy on the outside yet, soft on the inside. It was quite the indulgence to be dipping in these unique sauce which had quite lovely flavors. I do think however $5 would be more reasonable for these fries.   The seats were ok, not utterly comfortable. It just felt like a modern artsy and trendy american bar in a lively planet hollywood casino. And not to mention the bar staff was not really the friendliest. It felt very hostile and cold. I would have preferred a congenial 5 star service. I might be back, but the burger did not leave an everlasting impression that would make crave it again."}
{"text":"You have got to try it and see why Gordon is the master he is. Please do yourself a favor and order the Ramsay burger. It's not on the menu and it's simply the most outstanding burger I've ever eaten. The meat was moist , flavorful and cooked to perfection and the combination of duck breast bacon, avocado, and onions are to die for.   The staff is extremely friendly and professional. I was very impressed from the moment I walked in to the time I left, and they know the menu. Do yourself a favor and talk to them and ask them for recommendations. You won't regret it.   The only one criticism would be that the truffle fries were a tad too oily, although I still enjoyed them very much and the kitchen got backed up, so I had to wait a little longer than expected, but overall, this is a must try on the strip."}
{"text":"A large group of us dined here before the Britney show.  It's definitely a good burger spot.  We shared a bunch of starters which were all delicious - soba noodle salad, green salad, buffalo chx wings, along with their variety of fries.  We were all stuffed by the time our burgers arrived.  I ordered one with goat cheese, roasted tomato and truffle aioli.  The truffle was not overpowering and just enough.    They have a ton of surrounding TVs and a good option if you're at planet hollywood. Although I wouldn't make it a destination."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it here! My boyfriend & I came in on a Saturday expecting a long wait time, but we only waited 15 minutes.  We started our meal off with the truffle fries. Hands down, the BEST fries I have ever had. Then for lunch I ordered The Hog Burger & my boyfriend ordered The Farm Burger. Both burgers were absolutely amazing.  Now - my favorite of all - DESSERT! I ordered shake #4. It was the best shake I've had in my life. It's an oreo shake with creme brûlée pudding on top!  Im sorry for being so repetitive while writing this review, I was just very impressed with BurGR! I definitely recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Jalapeño poppers are out of this world. Never thought of adding bacon but I guess that's why Gordon Ramsey is an acclaimed famous chef and I am just someone eating at one of his places. I had the Uber Cheeseburger and my husband got the Farm Burger. Duck Bacon on a burger?!?!  Oh yeah !  These were the juiciest most flavorful burgers ever and I feel like I can never eat another burger again now. It was almost a spiritual experience. To top it off we split Parmesan Truffle Fries. Tasty!  I'm going to dream about this meal again tonight. Thank you Gordon Ramsey, thank you for Burgr."}
{"text":"It was the day after Christmas, and my daughters were craving a good old fashioned hamburger.  Even though they had enough food to last a lifetime, these skinny women can just put food away as if they hadn't eaten in eons.  We had several hours before we had to catch our show at the Encore, so we decided to slip away from Family, Relatives, and esteemed guests and have some Father / Daughters time since Mom was stuck entertaining.  They wanted to get some shopping in, and at least get a sampling of Gordon Ramsay's BurGR that they had heard so much about.   Surprisingly, in spite of all that we had heard, there wasn't much of a wait, and were seated promptly.  They didn't waste any time, and they ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger. I was going to try to be different, but peer pressure from my Type-A daughters (I wonder where they get this from?) resulted in my ordering the same exact thing.  We also had the Maui Onion Rings, and different flavors of Shakes.  Overall, we all had mixed results with the Hell's Kitchen Burger.   Even though we all agreed that the burger meat in general was excellent, the trimmings either added or detracted from its flavor. It really boiled down to personal preference.  The shakes were just heavenly, and the onion rings were light and crisp.  It was a good experience, but not awe-inspiring. From my perspective, it is a novelty for now - but nothing stupendous.   However, if you ever find yourself craving a scrumptious burger while shopping in the Miracle Mile Shops by Planet Hollywood, then this is definitely the place!"}
{"text":"I must say this review will be difficult for me to write.  I gave it 3 stars base off my personal experience there a few days ago, however I would like to stress this is at no fault of BurGR.    When I visited this place last Saturday, I was hung over.  Very hung over.  The wait was a little long but that was due to the mass amount of people there, really no fault of the restaurant.    When we sat down, the waitress was very friendly and gave us a chance to look over the menu while getting our drinks.  We got the parmesan onions rings and fries with our burgers.  I got the hot burger with chilis and I must say it lived up to its name.    Good things goin on here but I honestly couldn't enjoy the experience fully due to my own stupidity the night before.  But if you're craving a good burger joint with tons of creativity, this is a good place to start."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy!!! But well worth the wait!!!! Both my husband and I got burgers (they have other stuff too) my step son got a hotdog and little did we know the Hotdogs are huge! And way too salty. From what I saw not many people ordered those. I do recommend this place to people on a budget but still trying to get good food in Vegas. It's not too pricy!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay's \"Truffle Burger\" is sooo good. Its patty was cooked to perfection. The fries were really good too. We ordered both of the \"truffle fries\" & the \"Ooey Gooey\" - fries with melted cheese & fried egg. We also ordered the \"Hot Pockets\" to share. Though the hot pockets comes in 2 very small pieces, each cut in half, it was also tasty.   This was a great start to our #GordonRamsayEverything Vegas trip. We had dinner reservations for #GordonRamsaySteak @ 7:00 later that day so this burger completely hyped me up for dinner. I was thinking if his burgers & fries was this good then the steak must be magnificent. However, my experience at the #GordonRamsaySteak completely differed from my amazing & tasty experience here at #GordonRamsayBurGR. Check out my review for his steakhouse to see what I mean."}
{"text":"I tried going back. Prices for Vegas were awesome! Loved the food, had the Farm BurGR. So fresh and great flavors. Parmesan fries were excellent. This would be on my list too revisit on my next Vegas trip for sure. Loved it."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay Burger is not your usual burger place, it fit well with the vegas strip.  Amazing sweet potato fries, those were some of the best I had ever eat, it mix with vanilla powder, and the fries below of the cone were not as tasty and a bit overcooked.  Our group orders two burger, the farm and hell burger.  The burger was probably 1/3lb, there not big but just about right if you eating solo.  The buns were sesame both side; first time I see this in a burger bun.  It reminds me like those sesame bagel.  I was not a fan of those burger bun but there were definite unusual, the hell burger were supposed to be very spicy, so I told to lower the spice.  The spice level came way out very weak and defeat the purpose.    The service was good, refill water quick.  However was annoyed by their keep trying to sell us the dessert menu.  The food is good but not worth the price tag, since this is the strip is not a bad deal, despite burger cost $15 and fries were almost $10.  After all Subway nearby cost as much $10 for a foot long isn't such bad trade off.  The check comes with a ipod with a thank you message from Gordon Ramsay.  The restaurant atmosphere was modern inside, but the attraction is the big frame display of the restaurant. If you hungry.  If you are very hungry, better off goes to buffet or something, this however is a great  mid night meal after a club or a show.  Tips: Bring you total reward card, it save you $1 from any items in the menu."}
{"text":"So glad I came here! They have an amazing blue burger and the blue cheese was just delicious. They added duck bacon which surprisingly was very good! The truffle fries are to die for! I would definitely come back before I leave Vegas!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! By far, the best burger I have ever eaten. We started with the jalapeno poppers which took the normal bar food up a notch. The dipping cream was delicious and they have a secret extra-spicy popper in the mix that you don't know about. I was the lucky (or unlucky) eater the the extra spicy one! Very good! The buger I got had a fried egg and bacon on it, what else could I want. It was cooked perfectly and delicious. My boyfriend had a spicy burger (I forget exactly what it was called). He liked it but wished it was more spicy but I just think he was annoyed that he didn't get the spicy jalapeno popper! The highlight of the meal for me were the sweet potato fries. They were out of this world! They had this delicious vanilla spice on them and the dipping sauce was amazing. The drinks were also delicious. Service was excellent and out waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. I want to go back and try one of the desserts. This was by far the best meal I had in Las Vegas. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Fun atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable price! FYI if you are a Diamond or Seven Stars member of the Ceasars Rewards program they have reserved tables for you and you don't have to wait in line. I tried this the second to last day of my stay and like it so much went back for lunch the next day. The Hummus is amazing, and it comes with pita and assorted veggies to dip.  The veggies are unique, I couldn't really tell exactly what they were but I think I had a baby yellow carrot. It bursted with flavor. We also tried the chicken sliders, they were just the right size. The chicken was perfectly cooked an moist. I usually don't like chicken in restaurants because they over cook it and make it dry. The day prior we had a burger that had some type of chutney on it and we added avocado. Wow!!!! No wonder this place is called BurgR they got it down!!! If you come here make sure you try a burger even if you have to split with someone because you are missing out otherwise. Now both I got the wings as well. They have a unique sauce on them that also goes well with the fries. We ordered extra. Don't worry they aren't too spicy at all in fact the flavor is so unique you will just keep eating them trying to figure out exactly what makes them so delicious. The service here is top notch. The men all wear jeans, and nice clean cut form fitting shirts. And the women had either skirts or pants. It was cute because all wore uniforms but not your typical uniforms. And they sported them like they enjoyed wearing them as well. All the waiters and waitress's appeared to be in athletic shape and well groomed. The service was impeccable and they constantly insured we were well taken care of. I will probably get something here upon every stay now. Delicous! Awesome Job to the Gordon Ramsay Burger Team! You are all doing amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here yesterday for lunch. There was no line out front but the hostesses had to finish their conversation before acknowledging my husband and I. After we were seated our server was nice and made a few drink recommendations for us. I had the Ruby's kiss and my husband had the whiskey lemonade drink (I can't remember the name) I ordered the bleu burger and my husband ordered the truffle burger which we cut them in half and shared. The food took quite awhile to get out to us. But it was good, not great but definitely not bad. It's a good place to try if there's no line out front."}
{"text":"I'm sadly disappointed in this place. I had high hopes after watching it on a buzzfeed video on YouTube. We got there at 10pm on a Sunday night and the wait was still about 30 minutes. We were seated and ordered right away.... and sat there for another 30 mins. We were super hungry since we waited until 10pm to eat dinner. I got their premiere specialty burger \"The Hog Burger\". It came with tons of toppings, but wasn't nearly as large as it was in the buzzfeed video.(false advertising in the video) It wasn't even that flavorful for having so many topping. The simpler farmhouse burger with bacon, egg, and cheese was much better. We also ordered truffle fries and onion rings.... both were $10! The truffle fries were just steak fries with what seemed like Parmesan cheese, and there were like six medium sized onion rings in a basket.  I'm so sad we had a bad experience here bc I love burgers and Gordon... oh and they also had a $25 cork fee for bringing your own wine. Ridiculous! Will not be returning. I could name 5 fast food burger places that are far better than these $20 burger and $10 fries. You are paying for just the name.   1. In-n-Out 2. The Habbit 3. 5 Guys 4. Steak'n Shake 5. Shake Shack"}
{"text":"Just soo salty... The wait was 20 min but there were soo many empty tables inside. There were large groups and pairs but we were all seated as we were lined up... Which does not make sense in anyway. We ordered the Hell's Kitchen and the farm burger and sweet potato fries. Again burger was sooo salty. We loved the sauce of the sweet potato fries but the fries were half soggy and half crispy. ::sigh::: I wanted to like this place so much...I m just so disappointed. HIGHLY not recommended but you guys will try it anyways. :)"}
{"text":"Normally you wouldn't catch me at a gourmet burger joint, but  thought to give this place a try with all the good reviews. To start things off there was a pretty long line in front of the fire display they had. But for this line it was only for those with a party of two. For any parties over two they would have to give them there number and they would receive a text for whenever their table was ready.   We probably waited 30 min in line which isn't that bad I guess. For those that had parties of more than 3 it was approximately 2-3 hour wait.  So we get to our table and the choices that they had wasn't too much, but to me that's a good thing. We ended up getting the Parmesan fries which were actually really good and the sauces that they came with complimented it really nicely.   For the main course I chose to get the farm burger which had duck bacon and egg. Overall it was definitely a good choice. The only thing that I would recommend for this place is to actually have \"normal\" ketchup. I know that gourmet burger places aren't high on having just regular ketchup but it wouldn't have been nice to have. Instead they had this somewhat chipotle ketchup which wasn't bad though.   So yeah, good place if you're looking for a high class burger place in Vegas. Definitely would go here again."}
{"text":"The best burger joint in the whole country, I ordered the damnation chicken burger with chocolate smoothie, I did not have any burger taste in my mouth like that. the Parmesan truffle fries. it is pricey but it's worth it. I tried Jack in the Box and Sonic but nothing like Gordon Ramsay burger. his a tip for two people to order your own burger and drink and share order of fries."}
{"text":"BURGR still had a line at 9:30pm, but because I love Gordon Ramsey I had to try! 3 stars is an accurate reflection of my experience. The burgers were tasty, onion rings okay, and coffee shake very yummy.  I would definitely recommend getting the euro burger (aioli spread, roasted tomato, and goat cheese)"}
{"text":"This was the best birthday meal! BurGR is the perfect meeting of typical American food with some posh flavors and styling. I had the Yardbird which was sweet but also spicy so that it wasn't overwhelming. My boyfriend had the American burger and that felt like it got everything right about the burger. We also got truffle fries that paired really well with the dipping sauces. We could barely finish it between the both of us, but we did not regret it. We finished off our meal with Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Pops. They were so cute when they came on the stand. They were so sweet and alternated between the pudding and sponge cake type layer.   The customer service was great too. The girl who took our order was kind and attentive. And when she took a little bit longer than usual, she made sure to apologize even though she didn't need to!  My only complaint is that a soda costed 4 dollars. A soda should not cost that much. But I'll let that slide because it was so good."}
{"text":"We came here around 1pm on a weekend. There was about a 40 minute wait. They took down our name and one of our numbers to text us when our table was ready. I absolutely love that system and think more places should implement such a system. It allowed us to wander around the mall and kill time while we waited.  When we got seated, I noticed the creative menu designs with Gordon Ramsay's giant face on them. I also thought the fact they used ipads for each table for their cocktail menu was pretty cool. The vibrant pictures on the ipad screen definitely added to their appeal.  We ordered the roasted jalapeno poppers and truffle fries to start. The roasted jalapeno poppers were like a fun game of Russian roulette. They purposely left the seeds in one of the six poppers, so that one lucky customer will receive a nice surprise. The truffle fries were served with a side of truffle aioli and house ketchup.  For my entree, I ordered the farm burger. It came with duck breast bacon, a fried egg, and sharp cheddar. The burger was pretty good and filled me up nicely. But i've had better ones for less. Overall, I enjoyed myself immensely here as I'm a huge fan of burgers, but the value for the price point will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"I couldn't write a bad enough review. The sauces are horrible. The place is filthy. The jalapeño poppers are filled with cheap cheese Tabasco sauce mix. And came out cold. Disgusting. Do not eat here. Even if it's free. Run away quickly!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Went on a Tuesday, arrived at 11 am (opening) about 20 people in line but all we're seated quickly so no complaints on the wait.  I ordered the American burger and Just fries (regular potato fries with chilli ketchup and curry ketchup).  It was too much food for one girl but I knew that going in, I just had to try them both.  The fries would be a good size for two Canadian girls to share.  The burger was 3*'s all the way.  My biggest disappointment, the bun.  Looked great but tasted just ok, further to that the texture was almost stale and chewy.  It had been grilled (heated) at some point but not recent to arriving to me.  The beef was tasty and well cooked.  There were 4 pickles and 2 tomato chunks teetering on top of the burger which made it difficult to close but even more difficult to get a bite of burger with pickle and tomato on it.  I know a lot of places do that but I still don't like it... Spread the love.... Don't stack.  Oh, and too many red onions for my liking.... A whole thick slice.  The fries were 4*'s, large chunks of English style fries cooked golden brown, yes I agree with previous reviews - the ones at the bottom of the serving container get a tad soggy (but they're still delicious!).  The curry ketchup won best overall and biggest surprise at 5*'s.  It paired perfectly with the fries and was extremely addicting.  It's worth adding I did not think I would like curry ketchup, at all.    Dining alone I ate at the bar, service was pretty lame at first until some loser decided to stand behind me waiting for my seat and for me to finish my wine at which point the bar tender made it clear to me that I was to relax and enjoy myself and told the DB to wait somewhere else.  I wasn't wowed but the overall experience, especially since it's called BURGR (and that was the biggest fail) but there are some good qualities.  I probably wouldn't go there again unless I tried the other burger places on the strip and they were worse."}
{"text":"This was mediocre at best. Maybe my expectations were too high.   Initial reaction was good, sleek modern decor, very clean, we were seated quickly.   I got here after a long day of traveling and was absolutely starving! My burger sounded great on paper, egg, cheese, bacon, how can it go wrong? Unfortunately my food came out overcooked and dry. Very un-Gordon Ramsey-like. The onion rings were OK, very regular, nothing special, greasier than I prefer. Beer was fine, its beer, but the iPad system for the draft list was annoying.    Red Robin has better burgers and onion rings at half the price.   Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Expectations are high, it's Gordon Ramsey we're talking about here. Well Gordon Bennett, it didn't quite make the cut! I had to send my fries back because they were cold and stale. On top of that the burger just wasn't better than Red Robins. My medium looked exactly like my friend's well done. It was good but not up to expectations. Sorry Gordon, better luck next time..."}
{"text":"So we got lucky on our recent stay at PH and the line at lunch time for BurgR went quickly.  The staff was great and the food choices made it tough to choose.  There was a special Gordon Ramsay burger that was delicious and the fish and crisp sandwich was so good! We got plain fries and onion rings and the came with the tastiest dipping sauces.  Especially the ranch with cheddar cheese dip!  If you are in Vegas, go there for a really great burger!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing  food was  until we left and my stomach started hurting. I donno what it was they make everything themselves and there even the ketchup . But service was amazing so try it ."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our visit to BurGR. Nothing mind-blowing, but good nonetheless.   We shared the Blue Burger and the Farm Burger. Both were cooked perfectly, and were very tasty. The real star of the meal however, was the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Yum!! And just in case that wasn't enough truffle for ya, they came with a delicious truffle aioli.   Staff was very friendly, but service was pretty slow. Our table was pretty neglected.  Atmosphere was nice and casual. You could come here in jeans and a tshirt or dressed up a bit and still feel in place.   Overall: Wasn't anything particularly special, but would probably come here again."}
{"text":"Truffle burger is awesome. Slow service but jalapeño margarita is on point. If you like pork they have the burger for you. Worth the wait"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay BurGR is located in Planet Hollywood. The fiery window display warms you as you inch forward in line (15 minutes for my party of five.)   I tried:  -- chanterelle burger: only ate 1/4 (to be fair, I usually only eat 1/4 of any beef burger!) No exciting flavors despite it containing onion jam & add-ons such as avocado & a fried egg.  -- belly-bustin' onion rings: its greasy, excess batter & side of heavy parmesan ranch dipping sauce made me queasy. -- strawberry shake topped with coconut custard: oh yea, i can just feel my jeans tighten with every sip. I'm surprised I didn't pass out in a food coma. -- sticky toffee pudding \"push pops:\" pales in comparison to the original dessert we had at GR's steakhouse. Most disappointed with this item.   What happens in Vegas doesn't stay in Vegas when the thing that happens is a 4,000-calorie food baby. It wasn't worth the damage.   Service: getting our waiter's attention was extremely difficult."}
{"text":"Best burger of my LIFE! I came for my birthday and we almost walked away when we saw the line. Turns out it moved fast and I was impressed with their technology. They send you a text when your table is ready so you can walk away and get a drink nearby and relax. After a short wait we were at our table. You could tell they thought about everything. The waitress was very informed about every item on the menu, even when the food was served they make sure to face every plate in the same exact position.   But let me get to the food. Prices extremely reasonable, especially considering this is a gourmet restaurant. All the choices were appetizing, I went with the Euro burger (truffle, goat cheese, arugula) and my boyfriend the boar. We had the truffle fries to share. Everything was as good as it gets. The meat was cooked just enough and juicy. Again I was so impressed at how well thought out everything was.   I cannot wait to return here!"}
{"text":"Went here with my brother while we were in Vegas.  Stood in line at 3 pm with our parents, no one took our names or said how long the wait would be.  Line seemed to be moving well until we got to the front then they told us it was an hour wait. My parents decided to eat later so that we could eat at the two seats at the bar ( I had to be back at the airport and could not wait the hour)  That was a little disappointing that I couldn't eat with them.  I got the Uber cheeseburger that was good and Shake #3  was absolutely killer.  My brother got a plain cheeseburger and fries.  You had to pay extra for the fries.  Once we were seated service was just average,my brother had to flag down the bartender for another coke.  I think you are better off going across the street to Holstein's, they are just all around better.  I really wanted to like this place a whole bunch since I am a big fan of Gordon... but I thought it was just average at best."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently visited Las Vegas for our anniversary. As HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans we had the goal of visiting all 4 of the Gordon Ramsay Vegas restaurants (Steak, Pub, Burgr, and Fish and Chips). Sunday afternoon after already visiting the other three GR restaurants, we showed up at 11 am for a lunch at Burgr. We were promptly greeted by the hostess who as soon as they opened immediately sat us. Our server, Guy was over to our table immediately and engaged us in a friendly conversation. After learning that it was our first time at Burgr he kindly made some suggestions and thanks to him I ended up ordering something completely unplanned and out of my comfort zone, and i must say... I am so grateful for his recommendations. Our entire meal from the appetizer to the dessert was delicious. The service Guy provided was easily comparable to the amazing service we received the night before at Steak. Both my wife and I are thoroughly impressed that at both Gordon Ramsay's flagship steak restaurant and at the more casual Burgr the service is consistently amazing!!! I hope someone with authority at either Burgr or the Gordon Ramsay Group reads this so Guy can receive the recognition he deserves!"}
{"text":"Friends liked it-their dogs and burgers were good.  Truffle fries really good.  Eater be warned- the jalapeño poppers.....one of the six still has the seeds in (their \"surprise\" pooper). I'm the unfortunate one who ate the flaming mess and paid for it the rest of the night.  I wish they'd warn you beforehand- I just thought I was a spicy wimp all of a sudden!  Not their fault I can't handle heat but would have drastically changed my decision to eat a popper (and the rest of my night!). I'd go back, just not for the poppers."}
{"text":"What a fun place to grab an awesome burger! The service was friendly, the burgers were delicious and the fries were something to talk about. I almost wanted ketchup but the fancy ketchup grew on me. The euro burger was delicious I found myself wanting just one more bite. Oh, I ate every bite! You could share the fries but I was dining solo. They offered milkshakes but I didn't have room. They looked delicious! The other eye catching thing was the jalapeño poppers. They come on a neat tray and there must have been 8 of them and story has it one is a surprise and super hot! Maybe next time. Live the flame outside and the kitchen was popping and fun to watch. They do have a bar to sit at to watch the kitchen fun, 'tvs I guess that is a Must in Las Vegas. I'm glad I walked right into the Place. Just wished I would have run Into Gordon Ramsey himself"}
{"text":"Apparently we're not eating here. Bartender supposedly put in our order at 7:13 (on receipt), and we have a concert at 8pm...7:50 now, food never showed. The guy who ordered after us had his food show up 10min before we had to leave for the concert. We actually walked out.  I'm adding to my review, because we were really looking forward to having dinner here before the concert. We took bar seating since it would be quickest, and didn't mind the bar section. As soon as the male bartender asked what we wanted to drink, we already knew what we wanted to order, and gave him both our drink and menu order and told him we were there for a concert that started at 8. Our receipt showed our order going in at 7:13pm.  We sat and enjoyed our drinks as we watched the female bartender work her ass off. She was impressively knocking out drinks and even restocked her own ice. And we also watched the male bartender who took our order, be confused. He would ring out checks and triple count change and the POS (the registration computer) system looked like it was kicking his butt. He would be fiddling with the screen and have this confused look on his face.   Meanwhile, the gentleman next to me placed his order as soon as he sat down. His food arrived in minutes, ours were still a no show. Unfortunately the gentleman had to flag down the male bartender to return his burger, he said it was too rare and the fries were undercooked. Not a good sign.  We looked at our cells and saw it was 7:50, couldn't find the male bartender - he disappeared. Flagged down a manager and explained that our food never showed, but we had to get to our concert and she apologized and didn't charge us for our drinks.   From this experience, it'll be a while before I come back to try the food as everyone raves about it. And we are locals. But from our observation of employees working here, they should hire more females because they were getting the jobs done. I jest, but please help get the male bartender up to speed, because this was a bitter experience for us locals to have in a restaurant like this. The female bartender was kicking ass. I'd give her 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"This is now our third Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I like to think of his approach as basic but refined. There are few foods more essential (the sense of basic) than a hamburger.  His poppers come in shot glasses filled with sauce. Very spicy, but the jalapeño flavor comes through. The farm burger egg was perfectly cooked and decadent from first bite. finely sliced duck ?leg passes for bacon in this really decadent hamburger. The Überburger's three cheeses make one of the best cheeseburgers I have ever tasted.   Two asides; I discovered a beer called Linkenkugen that will surely be one of my all-time favorites and They put a Europa League soccer game up for me. That's unusual in the US but just made everything shine just a little more."}
{"text":"I go there for the hell's kitchen burger, hate the long wait time. The burger is gourmet and refreshingly awesome along with the toffee pudding."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food!  We ordered the truffle fries best I've had.  My boyfriend ordered the HellsKitchen burger and it was juicy and the bun was fresh.  I ordered the Euro Burger amazing!  We had for desert the the sticky toffee pops and OMG!  Perfect ending to a meal.  For drinks I had the Blood Orange Martini and it was so good!"}
{"text":"A good experience but I can't say I loved burger. We ordered pork burger, duck burger and jalapeño burger, French fries is extra charges.. I was expecting more flavor because of the prices. But once again, it is Vegas. It was nothing spectacular to want to go back to try again. At least I can cross it off the bucket list."}
{"text":"We usually try to avoid these celebrity chef eateries, but we both really wanted a burger and decided to stop in while in Vegas for a couple of days. It's hard to tell WTF Planet Hollywood is - is it a mall? A hotel? A casino? Weird, since I think of it as a TGI Friday's with a Hollywood theme, but whatever. I'm sure a name and concept change is coming in the not-so-distant future. So, the burgers - were awesome!!! I had the American (I know, I know - boring!!!) and my fiance had the Farm (egg, duck bacon - he was instantly in love). Onion rings were amazing. The drinks are listed on an iPad. Totally impersonal and ridiculous - the one our waiter had took a dump while he was trying to show it to us, and he awkwardly scurried away to get us a new one. I hate those things, I hope they go out of style ASAP. I would definitely go back for more of those rings and one of those tasty sounding shakes!"}
{"text":"I've had this review in my drafts for quite a while, but wrote a note to myself as a reminder of my impression. \"It was alright.\" So there you have it, my three word review for Gordan Ramsay BurGR.   Longer review here:  Bf & I went to Vegas over summer, and we were both determined to check out BurGR despite the long lines. I had recently seen a friend's IG pic of the Farm Burger, and since he raved about it, I wanted to try it out for myself. Besides, one of the best part about Vegas is trying good food, so why not?  We came on a weekday night and waited in line for about 45 minutes. We both ordered the Farm Burger [$15] (duck breast bacon + english sharp cheddar + fried egg) and truffle parmesan fries [$11] to share. I went with the farm burger because: 1. Seemed to be the most popular item based on Yelp pics, 2. Oooo duck bacon?! = must try, 3. Server recommendation.   Now, for all the hype about this place, I expected it to be good. Unfortunately, I was a bit underwhelmed and disappointed with my experience. Three points to highlight:  1) Service was awful. Does it always take over half an hour for the food to  come out??? (including our appetizer, the fries) After waiting in line for close to an hour, hunger level was approaching hangy-ness. After ordering, I was expecting to get the food and start eating in maybe 10 to 20 minutes tops. At the half hour mark, we asked our server, and she claimed it was the norm for food to take this long. However, the tables seated nearby who came in AFTER us already got their food. And besides, couldn't they at least bring out the fries?  2) Food was meh. Maybe it was because they kept me waiting so long, so the anticipation/expectation were at an all-time high. But my burger didn't really WOW me. I mean it was good, don't get me wrong. Just a tad too salty for my taste. The fried egg was a nice touch, though. Fries were not bad. Curious about the curry ketchup that comes with reg fries, so if I return, will def try it out.  3) Presentation was great. Although I was underwhelmed with everything, I loved the small details about this restaurant. The fire display at the entrance that enthralls you every time you walk by (and a perfect photo opp!). The menu with a photo of Chef Gordan Ramsay himself, which makes an nice keepsake. The way the food was presented, which makes eating (and taking pictures of it) more enjoyable if I must admit.  All in all, I will admit my first experience with Gordan Ramsay BurGR was a tad underwhelming. Even though it was very exciting to eat at my first Ramsay restaurant, the food (and mainly the long wait) was disappointing. Can't say for sure if I will be back, but if I am and my opinion changes, I will def write an updated review."}
{"text":"When you go such branded restaurant you obviously have expectation to be blown away by the various tastes or just be somewhat surprised ,  I wish this was the case this time - this is one of those times when it's better to go Support and eat in some smaller local business than checking in a branded one   Burgers were small , dry , plain and not surprising on any scale,seems that hanging a photo of yourself works pretty well for business if your a star  Fries were nice though  Thanks"}
{"text":"COMPLAINT: I get it that this place is ALWAYS packed, after all it is Gordon Ramsey's place. There is a queue for parties of 2, and the wait seemed about15-20 min. We were a party of 3 and had to put  our name in for a 45 min wait. When they paged us, we were pointed to a small bar table. I asked for a real table in the dining area and was told I would have to wait another 90 minutes. As we sat at the really small table I saw 2 booths in the dining room available within 5 minutes. WTF? We crammed 3 drinks, 3 burgers and an order of fries on our tiny table. It made for a real hard time to eat without knocking anything over. I WOULD HAVE SPENT MORE MONEY on extra drinks, appetizers, salads, and dessert, but it wouldn't fit on the table. Food is awesome! Server was awesome! Hostess FAIL. I gave 1 star in hopes to get management or Ramsey's attention!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burgers we have EVER had.  Went there with a group of 5. Wait time was about an hour and a half, and they texted us when our table was ready. Service was good. For appetizers, the wings and onion rings were delicious. The best part of the meal was the burgers. They were perfectly cooked, the bun was fresh and the while thing was an explosion of flavor. Recommend the euro and Hell's Kitchen burgers. #1 burger joint in vegas and probably in the US"}
{"text":"Service was excellent!  Our burgers were perfect.   The onion rings were to die for.  We love this place.   We will be back.  We even had a manager visit our table to make sure everything was good"}
{"text":"I loved this place and expected nothing less as it is Gordon Ramsey's place. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was amazing with the avocado, asadero cheese, jalapeño and roasted tomato. I had the sweet potato fries which were amazing my fried got the Parmesan truffle which we just as good. I went with the Oreo milkshake as suggested by the waiter and it was delicious but I didn't like that half was pudding since I'm not a fan of pudding. Nonetheless my experience here was great and I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Servers were friendly and food was superb. I had the hell kitchen burger it lived up to the expectation. The bun was soft the burger was cooked perfectly it had a spicy jalapeño and a cool cucumber OMG the sweet potato fries were AMAZING..... well worth my caloric intake. Please be warned the line can't be pretty long at night not sure if you can call and make a reservation but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is exactly what you'd expect: absolutely brilliant burgers with a hell of sticker shock. As far as spots with the Gordon Ramsay name on it, this is probably going to be the most economical. And the food did not disappoint. Seeing as my new wife was fairly price sensitive, it wasn't ideal for us, but I was pleased with both the burgers we ordered.   If you're looking for cheap, however, go a couple blocks down the Strip to the nearest food court. If you don't mind spending an extra twenty bucks on a very nice cheeseburger, however, I'd highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Great option if you want good food and a low hassle restaurant that's on the strip. The burgers were decent, but we just wanted a quick meal that wasn't at a fast food chain or a high end restaurant. Location can't be beat. There was a short wait though, maybe five to ten minutes."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while in town and was underwhelmed to say the least. Food was average although service was fine. Ordered the fish and crisps sandwich expecting a gourmet type fish sandwich and was dissappointed. Received a fish sandwich that was as unique to see as it was to eat. Not really that flavorful as it was salty. Truffle fries were nice but couldn't make up for sandwich. Would recommend bobbys burger palace as this was much more enjoyable as a whole."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers :] lines are ridiculous, but it's worth the wait. I wish they had more dessert options :b the shake is yummy, but I wasn't fan of the top half (the pudding part). Overall, it was worth the hype and everyone should try it at least once."}
{"text":"Our party of 3 went to Gordon Ramsay BurGR at 6pm on a Wednesday night. A Wednesday night while CES was going on and the prelims for Miss America were taking place inside Planet Hollywood. I've began this review with this particular info to emphasize that there was no wait for seating even though there were special events going on in town. It may be due to the rather large dining area or maybe we were just lucky, in either case, we were seated immediately.  Our server came over and introduced herself and then placed an ipad on the table and explained how we can look at the alcoholic drink selections, see pictures and read ingredients. Pretty cool little feature.  We ordered two American burgers and one Britannia burger, Just fries, Sweet Potato fries and Beer Battered Maui Onion rings plus our guys both ordered beer while I stayed with lemonade.  We had a longer than usual wait for burgers but our conversation flowed along and with the Miss America prelims going on, there was no shortage of pretty girls coming into the restaurant. That doesn't have anything to do with the food but it added to the experience :)  The manager herself delivered our drinks, introduced herself, explained they had only been open 3 weeks and wanted to make sure everything was up to par.  Our food was delivered by three servers. Each server took special care to place our orders so the BurGR logo on the plates was facing us. The burgers were on fancy squarish plates with wavy rims, the fries were delivered in huge cones with their respective sauces in holders on the base. The sweet potato fries came with extra powdered sugar in a shaker on the side.  Presentation is key and the burger by itself sitting on that pretty white plate was certainly an \"eat with your eyes\" moment!  I cut my burger in half and it was cooked medium rare exactly as ordered. The bun.... oh my goodness THE BUN! Nice fluffy brioche bun, buttery, crispy crust, light dusting of sesame seeds - I'd go back for that bun alone!  The cheddar cheese was melted and oozing, lots of arugula added a nice crunch and the mango chutney was a perfect compliment.  The sweet potato fries had a side of honey jalapeno mayo which I eventually dabbed onto a bit of burger just to see . . . . yep, that works too! It was sweet, not spicy and just delicious!  Our guys proclaimed their burgers as \"really good\"  but they though the Just Fries were just that. Nothing spectacular and not that good. The Maui onion rings mostly went untouched. Not sure what was wrong with them but they weren't that good. Certainly not worth the $8.00 price tag. The accompanying chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip were both a bit too weird for our guys.  So, at the end of the meal, the burger plates were cleaned completely, the sweet potato fries had just a few little pieces left, the Just Fries were almost completely gone and the Maui onion rings were 90 % still in their cone.  Once our dinner plates were cleared, our server returned with the ipad and the dessert offerings. As much as I wanted a Toffee pudding push up pop, I was just too full. Next time, I promise.  Our bill with 5 beers was about $110.00 before tip. The check or the (cheque) was presented in a black folder with an Apple ipod Touch inside. Once the check number was entered, the ipod offered a survey on the dining experience.  One downside to the experience was the repeated visits (interruptions) by servers to check on us. Yes, I know this is a new place and they want to make sure all is going well but it isn't necessary to ask us 4 times if our burgers are okay. Please let us enjoy our meal.  We left at about 8:30 pm and there was a line at the door waiting to be seated. Maybe earlier is better?  All in all, I personally was thrilled and will go back again. My husband says while he enjoyed it, he still prefers Grind over on E Tropicana but he will surely join me on a return trip.."}
{"text":"This shit was so bomb. I highly recommend the Hells Kitchen Burger! And the gooey fries! Yummm. Best burger ever!"}
{"text":"I've never even really been a \"burger person\". But last year, my sister and I were in Vegas & she's a huge Ramsay fan, so because I'd do pretty much anything for her, I agreed to wait the hour + to get a table at Burgr. Man oh man was it worth the wait! I wanted to be mad about the wait. Mad about the prices. Never did I think I'd be okay with spending $20 on a burger, I don't care who made it lol, but seriously, this burger was worth every penny. I know, I know...sounds crazy. But it was true. It was delicious. The shakes were bomb too. Drinks were excellent. Service was 5 stars. Gordon knows exactly what he's doing, & he does it well. Yumness all the way around!"}
{"text":"There are burgers then there are burgrs. Been here 3 times now and damn if the food isn't consistently amazing! The farm burger is second to none. The duck bacon is ridiculously good rivals real bacon and that says something. If you are in Vegas and want to taste what a real burger is come here. Waitresses are always great knowledgeable and friendly. There can be a wait so get there early. Beers on tap are awesome as well Sam Adams cherry is awesome. Don't let me forget the jalapeño poppers which have no equal wow these are amazing. To finish the meal the toffee pops are awesome and unique. Go here you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Had visited STEAK last time I was in Vegas so decided to try BURGR. Was not disappointed at all. Got there a little after 10 pm and the place was packed. Line out the door. After a 20 minute wait we were seated. Our waiter was very nice and super cool. Our food was yummy and everything came out very quick. Would love to come back and try more burgers."}
{"text":"I give it a 1 just because my drink was good. On 04/24/15 we went there for our 27th anniversary. Well let's just say my husband and I ordered the chicken burger. I ate half because it was kind of weird tasting. My husband ate it and was in the bathroom the rest of the night. I felt ill, but not to the extent that my husband was. My anniversary was great up to then. We paid a lot of $$. I have watched Chef Ramsey on TV and cannot believe that muck is what he is serving. I will not ever go back and wait in a line for an hour to be nauseous. I will make sure everyone I know is aware of this also. My poor husband didn't recover for 2 days."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant! The ambience and decor had a cool vibe. We had the onion rings, which were delicious, and the regular and Parmesan truffle fries, which were also good. The chipotle mayo was amazing! My Brittania burger was very good, and my husband really liked the Farm Burger. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"With the fame of the chef, we thought that the food must be good. Well, not so much.  We had the farm burger, which essentially just a regular burger with a few thin slices of duck bacon and a fried egg. The egg is a nice easy touch. The duck bacon, however, just a fancy thing to make you think it may be special, when it honestly is no special bacon. As a matter of fact, duck breast or not, you can not tell it from any regular bacon. The bun does look nice with a lot of sesames, however, it is so dry that you felt it is worse than any cheap supermarket bun. Totally not worth it. If I want to have a burger with an egg, I would rather going to Red Robin's for it's superbly juicy royal red robin burger. Much more tasteful and juicy than this boring dry bun superb pricy burger.  The Caesar salad is a bit better. But with a few leaves of added Kyle, it really does not warrant it for a $12 salad which is too simple to worth the price.  The only thing we like is an appetizer hummus. It is very tasteful and look beautiful , too.  The service is mediocre. Our waitress was ok. But you do not feel any warmth. And all the time she came or passed by she kept looking at ceiling while talking as if we did not exist. There's no eye contact at all.  Honestly, with the 40 minutes wait for such mediocre food, I guess we learned the lesson that never go to eat just for the fame of the chef."}
{"text":"wasn't really impressed with the burgers, felt like they were trying way too hard to be something different, its a burger place, provide quality meat and buns and you're all set! Don't try to re invent the wheel! Decently priced though so its worth to check out at least once to say you have done it. Get the jalapeno poppers!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had their mexican burger.  The burger was ok, nothing special.  I feel they could do more as far as flavor and seasoning. They have a decent beer list.  The location is cool and great for people watching.  I'd go back but prob try some other places first."}
{"text":"I think the burger is better here than at Holsteins.  I got the Hell's Kitchen and it wasn't too spicy.  The fries were good but at $11 apiece, way too pricey.  The shakes were a little different as they were topped with pudding.  At first I was kind of weirded out by this but now when thinking of my shake, I am totally craving it.  Service was super attentive and on top of everything.  I would totally come back for a burger and shake but would skip the expensive fries."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying: Gordon Ramsay is my idol.  This restaurant did not disappoint. I ordered the \"Heaven's Kitchen Burger\" which was simply the Hell's Kitchen Burger with no jalapenos :). It was PERFECT. However, the must order item is definitely the truffle fries. They are simply amazing. My friend ordered the Bleu Burger but found it slightly potent - so only for a stronger palette.   The cocktails are good too - the fruitier ones especially. The service is friendly. I had an amazing time here and love Gordon Ramsay even more (if that were even possible).  Finally, SHAKE #4 with creme brulee pudding and oreos was TO DIE FOR."}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers look to be some of the most common kinds of food on the strip and almost all of them suffer the same problem.  They use all of these high quality and expensive ingredients and end up making a burger that just tastes like a bunch of shit thrown together.  That's really is what a burger is, but if I'm going to spend $10+ for one, I want it to be remarkable.  Gordon Ramsay seems to be aware of that problem.  Every ingredient in every sandwich at Gordon Ramsay Burgr stands on its own.  Every one of the items has character.  You can get burgers for a dollar almost anywhere.  GR Burgr justifies the costs.  FOOD HIGHLIGHTS:  Farm Burger: Everybody has a bacon and egg burger on their menu, but somehow GR Burgr does it incredibly right.  It's hard not to love duck breast bacon, but what impressed me was that you could somehow taste the egg behind all of the fattyness of the beef, the bacon, and the delicious buns they use.  Highly recommended.  Hell's Kitchen Burger: This one has kick.  The spiciness of the peppers are tempered by the cooling effect of the avocado, all of which supplement the buns and beef very well.  Also recommended.  Parmesan Truffle Fries: If you're a fan of either I probably don't even have to tell you they're good.  The fries are perfectly cooked with delicious potato-ness but also substantial crispiness.  The sauces they come with are worth licking from the bowl... not that I did that.  CONCLUSION  Call me crazy, but I found myself comparing Gordon Ramsay's burgers with some upscale  maki sushi I've had.  Each one had a complex and long lasting flavor with well balanced ingredients.  Yet, they are still burgers, so they can also be enjoyed casually.  Burgr is the first and possibly the only Gordon Ramsay restaurant I'll ever eat at, but as far as I can tell... this guy definitely knows his stuff."}
{"text":"Since we were in Vegas and love burgers we wanted to check out Ramsay's BURGR. Coming from LA where there are awesome burger joints a plenty we expected good, what we got was excellent. By far one of the top 5 burgers we have ever had. I went with the Hells Kitchen Burger, my husband with the Farm Burger. Both where amazing. When the Gooey fries came out, it was more that we expected but they were delicious and it was hard to stop eating them even when we were full. The staff was friendly and attentive, the manager even stopped by our table for a second to check on our meal and experiance. Very friendly guy and nice vibe. Not to mention the check didn't break our budget like many places in Vegas can. So if you love burgers and are in Vegas, skip out on the hyped buffets and check out this place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and worth the 20 min wait in line . Hell's Kitchen burger was the best great flavor and not too spicy The farm burger was good but hell kitchen burger was the winner!  Waiter was quick and attentive!"}
{"text":"Well there's a long wait on a Saturday night.  About 45 minutes for a table and 25 minutes for the food.  The decor is amazing and definitely plays on Ramsey's Hells Kitchen (even a burger names that).    Overall, I think its one of the better burgers I've had, but barely worth the premium (15 for just a burger).    I had the Britannia burger, which was topped with mango chutney and truffle fries.  Burger was decent but fries were great.  Not something I'd go to again if I were in the area but a fun experience."}
{"text":"Beer was good. We had the hop garden.... I think...? We sat at the bar. The bartenders were on top of it. Very present & helpful. Our burgers were amazing, I had the euro burger & my fiancé had the hog burger. Both were good. The fries were whatever. Didn't finish them which says something because fries are my weakness. Anyway, good burgers!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay is a certified gangster so this is one of those places that will never not have a line. Bear in mind that the line is just for people who haven't gotten a pager yet. You have no idea what the wait time really is until you get to the front. The food is good but I would not wait for over an hour.   Truffle Parmesan Fries (11) - steak fries covered in truffle parmesan and paired with ketchup and truffle aioli. These were really tasty but the fries were drier than I would have liked. They weren't fluffy on the inside =/  Farm Burger (15) - The sunny side up egg makes this burger. It's a messy one for sure but you can't go to a burger restaurant and not get your hands, face, shirt, and maybe even pants dirty.  Yardbird (14) - This chicken burger was surprisingly juicy! It's seasoned perfectly and lighter than the other burgers. It's actually my favorite one I've tried.  Fish & Crisp (16) - The cod was fried to perfection but they doused the sandwich in tartar sauce, thus masking the fish. What a shame.  [TIP] Remember to bring your Total Rewards card to knock off a dollar off each item! If the wait is outrageous (1+ hr) and you don't have that kinda time to throw around, try Holstein's in Cosmo!"}
{"text":"The food is good but we seriously waited for at least 34 minutes for a burger, a dawg and a fish sandwich.    The service is really not first class.  Our water had a bug in it and it took long time for my daughter to get the replacement.  And the server did not say anything like we were the trouble maker who made a big deal out of it.  It was not a big deal for us until we saw how the service was turned out.  Also, we asked for takeout the left over and our server offered to wrap them for us, which was great until she piled up our food on top of each other.  The bottom of the plates were touching the food.   Seriously?  I wonder how she does that at her house.  I cannot imagine a fine restaurant like burgr had a such a weak trained service team.  It's a shame."}
{"text":"Great place to come to enjoy yummy burger from Mr. Ramsay ;). I ordered 2 burgers and 1 japanese pasta! So quick and perfect! You should come there! Best time w family or friends!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT FOOD! Try the push up pops!!! Wait was only about 20 mins, line moves fairly quickly. If you have a party of 3 or more they will send you a text message when you are ready to be seated. Great service!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!"}
{"text":"So my hubby and I have been craving another Gordon Ramsay burger after eating one a year ago here in Vegas at his English pub restaurant.  We were a bit disappointed as his burger at his Burgr restaurant was not nearly as delicious.  Mind you, the burgers here are pretty gosh darn good, but if you want an amazing, beat your face up with your tongue burger, go to his Pub in MGM."}
{"text":"I honestly think this place is overhyped. The wait was about 20 minutes which was fine for a Sunday night. Service was great, but the food was just okay. I ordered the Euro Burger and my boyfriend ordered the Farm Burger. I felt like mine was lacking in sauce. We also got the truffle fries but there was nothing spectacular about it either. I've definitely had better and cheaper fries elsewhere. They do offer a discount of $1 off per item ordered if you have a Total Rewards card though, which was nice. We didn't get the chance to try out their desserts this time but maybe next time if we decide to come back."}
{"text":"I don't like to give bad reviews.  Generally I just won't go back.  However, I expected quite a bit more from this place and it was a little disappointing.  The location is just inside Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino so I wasn't expecting anything super upscale.  The decor was modern and a little quirky and I loved the uniforms.  Our server was very nice and attentive and playful until we ordered and then he literally never came back.  We weren't ignored though, we received prompt refills on our drinks but no one asked us how anything was. The food was very good and we left full and satisfied but one of our items was brought out wrong (truffle fries instead of regular) and we never got the milkshake that we ordered.  We didn't get charged for the milkshake and we were too full to even have it but we had gone there really looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I stopped by for dinner while I was last in Las Vegas.  I ordered the fish and chips.  I am a fan of Kitchen Nightmares and have seen Gordon Ramsay prepare fish and chips several times.  His preparations do not resemble what I was served.  It tasted good, but it was not fish and chips."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and shakes--5 stars . Parmesan fries a little salty though. I am giving 4 stars cause I think they can improve more. Creme brulee and Oreos doesn't really go together Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"We have heard really good things about Burgr. We found out tonight they are all true. The burgers were excellent. The service was good. My wife had the Brittain and I had the American, very very good food. Well worth the $$ about 30 for the 2. I woukd give this place 5 stars but they don't take reservations and the really did not like the fries. And i love fries with my burgers. I will return to Burgr when I am at PH. Amd recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Ambiance is outstanding Modern flair Prices are reasonable I had the jalapeño burger and added mushrooms to it Along with truffle Parmesan fries  The burger partly and bun were nicely done but all the other flavored were off. No jalapeño. Flavor as it was cut too big The fries tasted almost frozen and a little stale. Surprising to see from a Gordon Ramsay joint  Service was very good and friendly  I would give it 3.5 stars but Yelp does score the 0.5"}
{"text":"Best Burger I have ever had ,you can expect to wait a bit but the line moves fast and don't expect a Whopper once you get there this is the Real Deal the Truffle Fries are Great too priced Fair and Good Sevice makes this Must Try Place"}
{"text":"Ok, so I must begin by saying that I am a huge GR fan! BurGR did NOT disappoint. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and my husband had the Blue Burger. We shared an order of truffled parmesan fries.  Everything was AMAZING! The service was great. The food prompt and perfectly cooked. I would eat here regularly if I lived near!  Well done!!!"}
{"text":"The best sweet potato fries you will have in your life!  Served with powdered sugar and a honey-jalapeno aioli.  Mouth watering!!   The burgers were worth the $13-15 dollars. Thick and juicy, and not your average flavors. I had a bruger with pork belly on it.   The only down side was they charged me for a glass of water, other than that I would recommend this place, Even if you just came for the sweet potato fries! they were that good :)"}
{"text":"You're paying for the name, had the apple ceasar salad which burnt my tongue because it's too salty which pretty much ruined the freshness of the euro burger that I ordered. Friendly staff but not impress for the price  had better tasting meal @ stripburger"}
{"text":"If you're a hot dog lover, get your hot dog lovin' butt over to BurGR for one of the best all beef hot dogs you'll ever have.  My mom and I both ordered the fresh roasted chili dawg--sans cheese. This was seriously a FLAVOR EXPLOSION. The hot dog had a genuine, juicy beef flavor and was slathered in tasty chipotle ketchup. I devoured this massively long hot dog at a record speed. Even the bun--the sweet, crisp bun--was a standout in comparison to hot dogs I've eaten in the past. With a tall beer and no sides, eating the whole dog left me satisfied.   There was only one small trouble. Right before my mom took the last bite of her hot dog, she discovered a hair amidst all the juicy hotdog madness. She instantly felt grossed out by her meal, of course. The manager came to the table and removed the cost of her hot dog from our bill. She was so gracious about the whole thing that it didn't put a damper on our delicious lunch.  Gordon Ramsey clearly dreamed up a unique vision of the classic chili dog and hot dogs will never be the same again now that BurGR raised my standards :(  Awesome lunch spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"BurGr always exceeds expectations! Love taking people there for their first time."}
{"text":"Here it is #50! Wooohoooo feels great doing the review on none other than a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. For my 100th I vow it will be Gordon Ramsay steak, but for now...Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. Went to Vegas for the July 4th weekend, something I might not ever do again...wall to wall PEOPLE! So I just had to try it out located in planet Hollywood hotel & casino. It's 114* degrees outside perfect weather for ohh I don't know a giant ice cube strapped to my forehead...but I will settle for a tasty burger & a beer. If you are not a rewards member with the casino you will have to stand in line, took about 20 minutes to be seated. Prices are affected by $1-2 on burgers for not being a rewards member. Great server named Elijah, very attentive, charismatic guy he served us up. I ordered the uber cheese, & me lady ordered the special of that day the \"Gordon Ramsay\". The burgers are very good, hers was a ground pork patty with duck fat bacon & avocado. Mine was montag blue cheese, and I think feta, it was a very good burger and the bun was good too. We ordered a side of fries and a couple beers, I Tried the magic hat never heard of it before, and it was very good. The only downside is I think the burgers should come with they're own side of fries, everything else is spot on. Ambiance,service,food. The chairs at tables do sit a little bit lower than most restaurants but for me it was ok. Please get to Vegas and enjoy a beer & and a burger from Gordon Ramsay's Burgr."}
{"text":"Been to BurGR a few times now. The burgers are decent but honestly was expecting better from Ramsay. The cherry whiskey lemonade is top notch. Definitely worth checking out, the flame centerpiece is really cool but haven't yet found that signature burger that makes me want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"My long anticipate restaurant to try out. We were there early, around 6:30pm ... waiting line wasn't bad. We walked up to the counter and give them our phone number, they will text you when table is ready. We hang out in the casino for about 50mins, finally got the text! Yeah!!  The food!! We ordered Truffle Parmesan Fries - thick cut fries with nice touch truffle oil, it comes with Special Ketchup and Aioli Sauce. Fell in love with the Aioli Sauce, so good!  Hubby's favorite Beer Battered Maui Onion Ring with Chipotle Ketchup and Cheddar Ranch Dips. It was super light and crispy, my friend said he can taste the beer!  Hell's Kitchen Burger medium rare with lovely roasted tomato and spicy jalapeno peppers, prefect balance with cool creamy avocado! The beef was perfect medium rare!  My friend ordered Southern Yardbird Burger - per my friend, it was the most tender juicy chicken burger he even tasted. It was indeed very tender!  Finally, I wanted to try something other than burger, so I ordered something I really miss since I came back from London.  Fish & Crisp Sandwich - it was a huge piece of fish served in between thick Texas Toast, topped with thin crisp with salted and vinegar. The fish was perfectly fried, light and crispy, steamy and flaky fish!  I definitely wanted to go back!"}
{"text":"We had one night in Vegas to get dinner. It was an incredible challenge to narrow all the choices Vegas has to offer down to one, but I'm a fan Gordon Ramsay and I had a taste for burgers so I decided to come to Gordon Ramsay Burger. I was quite excited if I'm being honest. I had really high hopes for the burgers at this restaurant.  The inside of the restaurant looked nice. It definitely looked like a posh burger joint. The employees were very nice and welcoming. The waitress that we got was great! She had a lot of energy and was very nice. I definitely felt welcomed there even though I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt in a swanky restaurant.   We opened the menu only to be greeted by some pretty high prices. I was fine paying them though because I assumed this was a gourmet burger that I was paying for. I had a hard time choosing what burger to get. The choices are mostly all unique flavors that it made it difficult. There were a lot of ingredients being used on each burger that I haven't seen before including many different cheeses. But after much deliberation I chose the Royal Burger. My partner went with the Deluxe Burger. We got a side of parmesan truffle fries since the burgers don't come with fries.  When the food came I was impressed by the presentation of the burgers. They looked delicious. The burgers looked as if they belonged in a commercial; you know, that perfect look that you never actually see in real life. All of the ingredients looked like they were placed on the burger in perfect amounts and evenly. The only downfall was that the burger patty size was unimpressive. It was a pretty thin patty for a gourmet burger establishment. I was sad to pick it up and destroy the perfection. The fries came in a cone and were coated generously with the parmesan. Along with the fries they had a garlic aioli and what I think was a house made ketchup.  Right away I grabbed a fry and tasted it. It was a meaty steak fry which I was not expecting, but I was happy that they were. They had a lot of flavor in them and you could really taste the truffle oil. I tried each of the sauces and they only added to the flavor. I'm a huge ketchup fan and I loved their ketchup. It wasn't as sweat as normal ketchup and it had a sort of smoky flavor to it. The garlic aioli was my favorite though. It perfectly complimented the truffle fries. I'll say they gave a generous amount of fries, but for the price they cost I would expect them too.  I picked up my burger, brought it to my lips, and took a big bite. First I'll say that everything about the burger was perfect quality. The bun, the meat, the ingredients. The meat was fresh and cooked perfectly to what I asked for (medium) which almost no one ever does. Burger places usually just cook it medium well or well-done regardless of asking for medium. The bun was nice and soft with a crispy outside and the lettuce was fresh and crispy. That's where my positives end.   Other than the quality being amazing, the flavor just wasn't there. The burger tasted good, don't get me wrong. The ingredients blended perfectly together on my burger, but in the end it still just tasted like a burger. There wasn't anything that popped out. Normally I would be ok with that and rate the place 4 stars because of the quality, but the burger was very expensive. For how much I paid for it, I expected the flavor to be out of this world or the size of the burger to be large. Unfortunately it was an average size burger (kind of on the small side with the burger patty) with just slightly above average taste. It needed more seasoning, a sauce, or something.   I tried my partner's burger and I liked his a tiny bit more, but after I bit into it we both realized that he had been served the wrong burger. Instead of the deluxe burger he had been given the Blue Cheese Burger. He was too shy to tell the waitress, but I'm sure they would have taken the burger back had he done so. Either way the Blue Cheese Burger was in the same boat as my Royal Burger. It was a good quality burger, but it still lacked that oomph that would make up for the cost.  I don't want this review to deter anyone from trying Gordon Ramsay Burgers. If you have the cash to spend and you don't care about prices then I'm sure you'd enjoy the place. There's nothing ultimately wrong with the burgers, but there wasn't enough right with it either to warrant the price other than the fact that Gordon Ramsay's name is on it. For two burgers and a single fry, the price came out to be $45. For that kind of price I just expected more is all."}
{"text":"Come here whenever me and the babes go to vegas. We always come on off times so all we have to wait is no more than 20 min. Everytime we try something new and we have never been dissapointed! This time we got the uber burger and i was worried just meat and cheese and more cheese wouldnt suffice, but boy i was wrong. The meat is always perfectly juicy and just looks and tastes like a work of art. The gooey fries were out of this world! My bf loveeeees over easy eggs on top of everything so we were sold on the cheese and egg alone. Then they add like a tasty prosciutto type meat with a bit of scallions...perfect! Oh and my ultimate favorite....thw hummus! She hummus is my ultimate fav and i try everyone's hummus. This one is soooo flavorful and usually u get like 2 pieces of bread and like flavorless celery. NOT HERE. U get plenty of pita bread(which itself is yummy) and u get cold refreshing cucumber, long green onions, carrots(orange, purple, and white!!) and crunchy radishes. I was impressed! The hummus was so smooth and flavorful with a olive oil like top that was soooooo savory!! Love love love it here!"}
{"text":"My wife and I waited about 30 minutes to get into Burgrs and found it to be worth the wait. Both of our burgers were cooked the way we asked for them to be cooked. I had the Hells Kitchen Burger, I forgot which one that my wife had, but she said her mouth was watering while she ate it. We got the sweet potato fries by accident (suppose to be regular fries) but we told them to leave them and we were glad we did because they were like desert. The jalapeno poppers were great and over all we really enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. It was also packed. Everything we had to eat was cooked perfect. I had some type of cheese fries and they were crazy good. The workers there were really nice and fast."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for a conference, and had such an AMAZING experience at Gordon Ramsay Steak that I came here for a quick burger lunch during break hours. Well, a quick lunch is not what you stop in here for. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and the appetizer Onion Rings as a side (it's a pet peeve of mine when a burger doesn't come with a side). Thirty minutes later my food was still not out. I think it finally arrived after about 40 minutes.  The taste was only okay. It was a basic good burger. There were HUGE chunks of avocado, and while I like avocado it took over the texture of everything else so I took it off. The onion rings were decent, but I didn't much care for the sauces they came with. I hated the curry ketchup.  Really this place was just decent. Because of the time it took to get my food, and that I paid so much for what I got I rated it only a two."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay's burger patty carries on its shoulders the strength and daring of a perfectly-seasoned steak the way Santa Claus carries a bag of toys, and drops them on your taste buds like it's some kind of flavor Christmas for your tongue. I had the unmitigated pleasure of dining upon an order of Pork Belly Hot Pockets and a Blue Burger here, and these were clearly the best hot pockets, certainly the best burger, and possibly the best food, that I have ever eaten.  I have watched Chef Ramsay on TV many times over many years, but never could have fathomed the difference between what his kitchen produces and what I was already eating.  After just one visit I don't know how I'm going to go back to regular food all the time.  I think I'll need to fly back to Vegas for a weekend soon, just to eat here again.  I wish Yelp offered a sixth star... I may hire someone to hack Yelp and produce a sixth star just for this review, I loved this food so much. I bow to Gordon Ramsay and thank him for extending me the opportunity to experience this kind of quality cuisine."}
{"text":"I love burgers. The best ones represent some of my favorite simple things in the food world: salt, crust on meat, flames, soft and toasted buns, tasty sides, etc. Add a tall cold beer, good service and perfect fries - and that's all we need. BRGR was SDLY JST NT GOOD. Waiting in line for 15 minutes, no big. Two beers took forever, waitress was inattentive, food arrived and the burgers were decent but the \"just fries\" were uncooked planks of tuber and weren't even hot. Switched them for sweet potato fries (another 10 minutes? WTH?), paid and bailed. Go have YOUR perfect burger at the burger place in Cosmo - waaaay better!"}
{"text":"Not too long of a wait for an  830 dinner maybe 20 minutes. The gal who sat was very nice and personable but the sever was mediocre at best. She did not have a drink menu so took our dinner order and said she would be back with the beer list. She took so long coming back my husband went up to the bar ordered our drinks and was back before she was back with the drink menu. The burgers was good however both of them were well done instead of medium and The truffle fries were also very tasty. An overall OK dining experience with decent food, but something I could have done without and not missed."}
{"text":"I have watched quite a few episodes of Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen and also Kitchen Nightmares, so having the opportunity to eat at one of his restaurants was pretty exciting.  Burgr is located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. The atmosphere is great- dim lighting showcasing the fire effects around the restaurant. Burgr does not take reservations, so be prepared to stand in line to wait for a table. However, the wait for a party of 2 was only about ten minutes. Not bad! Now, on to the food. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger which was amazing! I ordered it medium, and that's just how it was cooked. The roasted tomatoes were a nice change to the traditional sliced, fresh tomato, and added great flavor on addition to the avocado and peppers. My husband ordered the Uber Cheese burger medium rare and enjoyed it as well. If you are thinking about ordering fries, the Parmesan Truffle Fries are a must!! One order is more than enough for 2 people.  Now dessert.. For any of you who have watched the UK version of Kitchen Nightmares, you know how much Sticky Toffee Pudding is mentioned. And it just so happens to be on the menu here in the form a push-pop with salted peanut ice cream. Another must-try! My husband & I thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Burgr and are looking forward to our next visit there."}
{"text":"Fries were soggy, burger was dry not much flavor.  I had the Farm Burger.  Jalapeno poppers were waaaaay to spicey had heart burn afterwards.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Decent price: burgers are around 15 dollars, Oreo smoothie is 9 dollars, Parmesan fries is 11 dollars. And waitress is really nice, give me check after I finish my meal, so I didn't feel rushed even if the restaurant is really busy. Burgers are really large, and taste very well, especially the pork burger! I like Oreo smoothy the best, not too sweet! The dining environment is great too! Overall, it's a great experience!"}
{"text":"They got rid of the standing up knives.  The burgers were not the same. We got the Hell's Kitchen burger again and this time it was flavorless. We also got the earth burger and it was very very sweet. Wasn't expecting it to be that sweet.  The shakes are good but the \"pudding\" at the top has no flavor and tastes like solid thick whipped cream with gelatin.  The honey pig bao buns are not good. Piece of fat with carrots and cilantro on a stale Chinese bun. Plus it is very sweet as well.   Hope the next time we come it will be better."}
{"text":"The hot wings were not really good but their jalapeño poppers are a must ! The burgers are really good but not amazing like I was expecting them to be. The wait was absolutely ridiculous we waited for 2.5 hours and when we were about to be seated two people in out party were not present so they were going to give away our table after we waited 2.5 hours I was so upset. That is why for me this place got such a low rating. Do they serve gold here and that's why the wait is so long ??? Not worth the wait but my bf likes Gordon Ramsey and we thought it was going to be good. But had fun with our group anyways."}
{"text":"Any man who thinks he can reinvent the milkshake by putting pudding on top must have a god complex. Please take a minute to praise our lord and savior, Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"As someone who lives in Vegas, I have been meaning to go here for the longest time. Delicious. I expected nothing less from Gordon. The only thing I didn't like were the dipping sauces that came with my fries, but that was more of a personal preferences on taste. The wait staff was extremely nice and helpful with the menu. The price is not that bad considering it's on the strip and it's Gordon ramsays name. Would recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"I have a borderline obsession with Gordon Ramsey. Since I don't get cable, it's not with his Kitchen Nightmares or Hell's Kitchens or what have you - no, it's his ridiculous talent.  PEOPLE. GORDON RAMSEY IS MORE THAN JUST A YELLING BRITISH MAN IN A KITCHEN.  He. Is. A. GODCHEF.  There's this series called Ramsey's Ultimate Cookery Course; 100 recipes to stake your life on. And I would. Stake my life on it.  So when Ryan suggested we go to get burgers, I said, \"Meh...burgers..\"  \"Gordon Ramsey's restaurant.\"  BURGERS!  Worth the wait. Worth the price. Get the oreo shake with the creme brulee pudding and don't you fucking waste any of it.  Their whiskey cherry cocktail is too sweet for my taste and gave me a wicked headache.  The caesar salad was kale and romaine and despite being one of the most typically boring entrees, it was actually quite wonderful, mellow. The fries were great, too, and Ryan really enjoyed his burger (sans bun, because he likes to pretend he eats semi healthy).  Goddammit Gordon Ramsey, you did it again. Of course you did, like I would have doubted you for a moment."}
{"text":"Holy Moly, AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Such an awesome burger restaurant on the strip. Get the Hog Burger. It's pork paradise. I could eat the Hog Burger and Truffle Fries all day. Please give this place a chance, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I spent a week in Vegas. One night I went to GR Pub & Grill at Caesars, had Hell's Kitchen and it was great, even though the bun was ordinary. The next night I went to BurGR at Planet Hollywood, ordered the same thing expecting to have a repeat experience, and it was very different. The bun was better, but everything else was sub-par/tasteless. The fries were cold and the burger tasted horrible. I also noticed the server offering a special dish to others but she did not say anything to me. I hope GR reads this and ensures consistency across his properties. On a different note, I think the $$ rating for BurGR is misleading. The price does not include fries so the prices are equivalent as the one at Caesars, having a higher price rating."}
{"text":"Definite mixed feelings for this place. The burgers, I give a 3 or 4 out of 5. I've had both the Euro burger and farm burger. I found the farm burger to be too uneventful. It was kind of bland, and dry. The Euro burger was definitely more tantalizing on the taste buds. My SO had the turkey burger and enjoyed it.   The sides are definitely where the flavour is, and I give the sides 5/5. The sides are HUGE, so sharing is a must. The onion rings are so effing good. This last visit, we ordered the gooey fries to share and it was waaaaaay too much for just 2 ppl. Delicious though.  I wish they made smaller sides or a even a \"sampler sides\".   Overall, it's a good place to try once but my taste buds aren't crying to go back for the burger."}
{"text":"The flaming BurGR sign is cool and all but standing in line next to it after being in 100+ degree weather outside definitely is not ideal. I would recommend they blow more of the A/C along the flaming wall.  Service was great, our waitress was on top of the food and drinks. I ordered the farmers burger which was good. I just wish it had some lettuce but I'm the kind of guy that thinks all burgers should have some greens. Shared the truffle fries and onion rings - truffle fries were okay, I would recommend them tossing the fries with the cheese and truffle oil to give them a more even coating, rather than some truffle fries and some regular fries. Onion rings were outstanding. I also appreciate condiments so all the dippings with the sides were spot on."}
{"text":"I've been to Gordon Ramsay's restaurant at The London in NYC before (called Maze) and was pretty underwhelmed by the service we received. Totally different experience here.   Starting off, the place itself is pretty cool, with flames in the front window where you enter and neat little fold-up menus with Gordon's face on them. Then came the food.   For our appetizer, my boyfriend and I split the beer-battered onion rings. They were SO good. The crispies and possibly tastiest onion rings I've had. As the entrees, my boyfriend got the signature burger (Hog Burger) and I got the Earth Burger (veg option with portobello mushrooms). My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about how good his burger was and mine was delicious as well.   Not only was the food good, we had the sweetest waitress. Very attentive, super nice, and she even brought out a little push-pop dessert for my birthday!  Such a wonderful experience, I wish we'd had time to go back for a second round. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried BurGR for the first time during my last trip to Vegas. I don't think I've ever had a burger as delicious as this one. I had the American Burger. No frills: just American cheese, butter lettuce (a huge plus in my book: much better than romaine), onion, pickles and tomato on a fresh, fluffy bun. The burger was thick, cooked perfectly, and was so juicy. A little pricey for just the burger, but trust me, it's worth it. You are in Vegas, after all--it's worth the splurge!  Oh, and the fries? You NEED to try the truffle Parmesan fries. I dream of the truffle aioli they're served with.  Keep in mind too the portion of fries is VERY large. A group of three would probably be satisfied with a single order. We had two orders of fries for a group of three and were more than stuffed by the end of the meal.   If you're visiting Vegas, you need to have BurGR on your list of places to try. I will definitely going back during my next vacation!"}
{"text":"The food was, without a doubt, cooked to perfection - as expected from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  Our table of 5 ordered 4 burgers, sides of fries, and a caesar salad.  The wait for the food was a bit long as the restaurant was packed.  However, our waitress, Hilary, made up for it by being extremely helpful and professional in making sure our first experience at Burgr would have a lasting impact.  I would highly recommend this joint to anyone craving for burgers, and if possible, request to have Hilary serve you."}
{"text":"We went there on Sunday afternoon, there was a long line still. But it is worth of the wait.  I have to say this is best Burgr. It is another good place to eat in Vegas.  Will be back soon."}
{"text":"BURGR, service, Vegas, Planet Hollywood, Batch 19 pre-prohibition lager, awesome crowd, great vibe and killer burgers. Forget what you heard, this place is legit!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had. Usually burgers (even from a \"nice\" place) are so salty and greasy, but these burgers weren't like that at all. I didn't feel ill or uncomfortably full afterwards, and all the food was delicious. They quoted us an hour wait for the table, but it was ready in 25 minutes. The server was extremely friendly and even brought me a treat for my birthday."}
{"text":"Wir waren 2 mal bei GR's BURGR und hatten unter anderem den Uebercheesburger ( 15$ ), HellsKitchen Burger ( 14$ ) und die Truffle Parmesan Fries ( 11$ ) -  viel besser gehen Burger nicht ! So einfach ist das !  Der Service ist Standard, das Menu sehr übersichtlich und preislich etwas gehoben - sicherlich zahlt man hier auch den Namen mit - nichtsdestotrotz sind auch die Zutaten der Gerichte sehr hochwertig - geschmacklich war das ganze für mich eine kleine Offenbarung ;)"}
{"text":"While the food was good overall, I'm going to go with a solid 3 stars after factoring in the total experience.   Burgers: Good but not amazing. Kind of small! The two of us both ordered our burgers medium; however, mine was pink throughout and his was definitely well done. That's a pretty dramatic inconsistency.  Fries: We got the \"gooey\" fries. Definitely lots of gooey cheese, which was good. Portion was underwhelming, once again. And the egg was fully cooked! What's the point of having a solid hard-cooked egg yolk with your fries? Plus, presentation was pretty poor; there's gotta be a way to get these to look less sad!  Milkshake: Surprise star of our meal! Wish the glass had been bigger (it's a very tall but narrow glass), but the oreo shake was great and the creme brulee pudding on top was amazingly silky. Well executed and a unique concept. I would come back just for dessert, even if the shakes are pricey at $9 each.  Atmosphere: Quite loud, looooooong wait most times. What I found the weirdest, though, was that there was a photographer going around and taking your photo, then bringing around the prints to sell to you for $15. (We did not buy ours - not really into the concept, plus our photo was kind of terrible.) What is this, Disney World?? Felt odd. Interrupted our meal. I would say discontinue this partnership ASAP.  Super pricey generally, but I expect that for the location. Would be nice if portions were slightly bigger though! (Sorry not sorry for our shameless gluttony.)"}
{"text":"I have been here plenty of time could be one of the best burgers I have ever tasted I usually always get the Hell's Kitchen burger it is amazing also the chicken wings you can't compare to anything in this world there has been times I waited in line just to eat chicken wings there like nothing you have ever tasted , as for the jalapeño poppers crazy good they come with chipotle ranch dressing highly recommend this and the service has always been 100%"}
{"text":"For someone who yells at people for ticket times, putting his name on a restaurant that takes over 60 minutes to produce some burgers seems a bit hypocritical.  My friends and I waited 45 minutes for a table (to be expected) and then once we finally ordered, it still took another hour before our food came to the table. The food that arrived was okay but not great. The burgers were decent but definitely not special enough to be worth the wait. Definitely avoid the portobella burger, that was not good, which is unfortunate since that's pretty much the only real option for vegetarians. The fries were soggy and not very good. The wait staff said that they're supposed to be that way, \"softer than normal fries.\" Who has ever said, \"oh, I wish these fries were not crispy\"? No one. Those are just bad fries.  The one upside was a friendly waitress who was helpful in offering to do split checks or accommodate as many cards as we wanted to use to split the bill.  Overall, a very disappointing experience. I would not return."}
{"text":"I LOVE Gordon Ramsay so I was really excited to visit BurGR after seeing it on the MasterChef challenge last season. I saw those awesome flames out front and BAM I knew I was having a burger here.   They don't take reservations but the line to get a table moved very quickly around late lunch time. The prices are also great or at least compared to what I would pay for a bomb burger here in NYC.   The portions on the sides are pretty big so I would recommend sharing them. We were so stuffed from our breakfast we decided to split a burger too! I decided we should have the uber cheese burger.. I am a cheese slut... I love it mmmmm.   We asked for the burger medium rare and when it came to the table I was pretty convinced it was rare rare rare... the BF was happy but I couldn't do it. The texture is too much for me when it is this rare. I said something to the waiter and at first he argued with me but then snapped out of it and had the kitchen make us a new one.  The 2nd burger came out really quickly and was absolutely delicious. I couldn't leave this joint without one of those amazing looking milk shakes either so I was excited when the waiter told us we could get it to go. We had the carmel chocolate one and the hazelnut coffee one. They were lush oh my god. SO good but also SO filling. I wish I could say I finished mine but no such luck.   I am looking forward to my next trip to Vegas so I can come back for more burger heaven. :-)"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! The place was humming with excitement! Very visually appealing! Started with the beer battered onion rings with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch....PHENOMENAL! Had the euro burger and sweet potato fries and a shake #3. The burger had goat cheese and the most flavorful tomatoes I had ever had, sweet potato fries were served with powdered sugar and jalapeño mayo mustard. The shake was banana strawberry with butterscotch pudding and to finish it all off the sticky toffee pudding push up pops! I definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"Had the American Burger and it was FABULOUS!!!  the price was not too high and the burger was one of the best I've ever had.  Service was friendly and the food comes out quick despite how busy they are. Very popular place. I definitely will return."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, and at a decent price (for the LV strip).  Open late, lots of beers on tap, cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Chef Ramsay is a culinary god and genius restaurateur. i used to think it was all bullshit and spiffed up in production, but he walks the walk, as is proven by Burgr.  And although it looks like someone threw up Gordon all over the walls (and napkins and menus) at Burgr, it's sooo worth putting up with ...  The burger was ah-may-zeeng, cooked to a perfect medium rare and not overly-stacked with filler crap to the point where you can't eat it without a fork and knife. I had the uber-yummy Farm Burger, which featured English cheddar (really, once you have it, American cheddar just isn't the same), a perfectly fried egg, and duck breast bacon which, after tasting, I can never have another burger without.  My partner in foodie crime couldn't resist temptation and got the Hell's Kitchen burger (yes, we're fangirls). It comes with the burger essentials, a good cheese, jalapenos, tomato, and avocado. Also cooked to a perfect medium rare. Also perfectly delicious.  We ordered a side of the truffle parmesan fries for the two of us to split. Anything else would've been too much food. And those were so damn good. And tasted like truffles. Yummy, yummy truffles. *Mouth watering.* Of course, I also had to transplant some of the truffle aioli that came with the fries to my burger for extra mmm factor.  Oh, service was very nice. Maybe sliiiightly overdone to the point where it felt a tad fake, but honestly, I don't care. The manager made a point of coming over to the table to check in and was very natural about it. The waitstaff was extremely attentive. Even the seating hostess was friendly enough. The prices are also rather reasonable for the quality of food you get.  Downside? Aside from the over Ramsay-fied decor? The homemade ketchup-ish sauce was lackluster. Also the dining chairs felt a bit too low.   4.75 stars overall and yes we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay burgr  Great burger and flavor   Chicken sandwich was dry but flavorful   Staff amazing   Thanks guys I got to eat at your restaurant   Tony  Jacksonville Florida"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and each time was a great experience.  The food is great, the servers are really friendly and it really isn't priced bad for what it is.    First of all, one of the most overlooked appetizers is probably the hummus.  I know what you are thinking - way too healthy for a place like this.  But it really is the best hummus I have ever had.  I have also had the jalapeno poppers which are good, but really do have a kick.  The burgers are good.  The first time I was here I had the truffle burger and the second one was  the Hell's Kitchen burger.  Both amazing.    There are lots of other things I'd love to try sometime and if I come back to Vegas, this will be a stop for sure."}
{"text":"My friends and I had our first dine-in at BurGR this past weekend for lunch. We arrived at roughly 11:30 AM and were seated right away. However, by the time we left (about an hour later) there was a substantial line waiting to be seated.   I got the Hell's Kitchen burger (asodero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, roasted tomatoes, and jalapeno pesto aioli) and my boyfriend got the farm burger (duck breast bacon, cheddar, and fried egg). Both cost $15, which is the average price for the burgers. Our group shared an order of sweet potato fries ($9) and truffle parmesan fries ($11). Burgers takes 20 minutes to prepare.  I really like the buns holding the burgers; it held its structure and had black and white sesame seeds on top. The Hell's Kitchen was really good, but how it was constructed was not. I like a burger (and sandwich) to have a nice bite of all the layers together, but my burger had more avocado in the center, jalapenos pushed to the side, and tomatoes somewhere else. So, I had to do a bit of reconstructing in order to get that. Also, the aioli is so good, but there wasn't enough. I wish they had been more generous. I ended up spreading some of the garlic sauce and ketchup from the truffle fries to add more flavor. I didn't notice until my friends mentioned it, but the meat was slightly dry (we all ordered medium). As for the farm burger, it looked to have been more well constructed, and I tried a bite and enjoyed it. My boyfriend and I personally enjoy more fresh flavors, so a veggie would have been better for us, but overall it is definitely a meat-lover's kind of burger.  I really liked the truffle Parmesan fries over the sweet potato. It came with ketchup and a garlic truffle dip (sooo good). They were cut as wedges whereas the sweet potato were french cut. The sweet potato fries were sprinkled with powdered sugar and came with a sweet custard like dipping sauce. I thought it was sweetness overload. But if you're really into that level of sweetness, then maybe you'll like it better. The waitress suggested sharing 2 fries among us 4, but it turned out to be too much. We should have stuck with one order.  Overall, I thought BurGR was pretty good. I liked the service, flavors, and atmosphere. The flaming sign in the front is pretty darn cool. I had a good experience."}
{"text":"6/5/16 we our chicken and Farm and Hell's kitchen burger. Our chicken wings came at the same time as our burgers so we didn't get to really enjoy them. The beer menu is on  an ipad. Our waitress let us have a try of a beer on tap. They have some really great beers. The milks shakes looked amazing but we were too full to get one. Our burgers were perfectly cooked and juicy. The regular fries are ok. No Heinz ketchup here. The ketchup was a pleasant change from the norm. Will definitely come back and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Jalapeño poppers! That's all I gotta say! They have got the BEST of all jalapeño bombers! Out of 6 of them you get one super spicy one at random! Their so delicious, and perfect. Very simple small menu they offer here but every single item perfect and executed in its own way. Every single burger I've tried here so far witch is almost all of them, never failed to be happy with it. Everything is flavored to a perfect hit. Not too much not too little. Perfect service even with a full house. Friendly staff from your first greet til you leave walking out. Only thing I gotta say is the outfits! A little cheesy for strip attire I think!"}
{"text":"Service was soo good our server alex was super nice and helpful with food recommendations~ and our burgers were soo delicious my bf got the chanterelle burger and i got the hells kitchen both were awesome!^^"}
{"text":"For Vegas and The Miracle Mile,  this ia the best quality to cost around. Shakes are more gimick than taste though.  Fries and the burger are the way to go. Oh, im a huge fan of cheddar based poppers, but was not impressed with these (tough they sounded good).  I like more crunch out of the breading."}
{"text":"Never even got to go in. This is not a bashing of the food itself because I cannot contest to that.  I am sure it is fantastic, but the lines are outrageous.  It was barely 11am and there was over 100 people in line not to mention about 6 empty tables they seemed to be saving for more \"important\" people.  If you are that popular expand a little there was plenty of room.  Just my thoughts, if you want to go to eat here better get there at 10 am and wait till it opens."}
{"text":"We decided to go here because of the name,  We were a bit disappointed. They were busy, but our burgers took over half an hour to arrive. When they did, they were OK.  The burgers were good, but for the price, the beef was pretty dry.  We ordered a side of fries. They were super fresh, because when the server brought our food, he said that they would be out in a second. They were really hard, and definitely not worth the money!!  Overall, while the food was good, when I pay $45.00 for two hamburgers and a side of fries, I expect better."}
{"text":"Onion Rings. Firm, crisp, chefs / cooks KNOW how to batter-up som beautiful onion rings.  Best I've ever had.  Sit at the counter! Mike the bartender turned from what expected as just a meal, nto an experience, & converted me into a fan for life.  & his bar tending partner, Senya, busts it to churn out those drinks - both are masters of their craft.  I Vill Be Bock!"}
{"text":"Monday night a couple friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday within our group. I got their first, parked at The miracle mile shops (planet Hollywood) parking garage and entered. I'm not sure if it was because it was in the casino rather than the shops, but this place is no where to be found on the map when you enter through the parking garage. The concierge was there to help me find my way :) (walk towards urban outfitters/Las Vegas Blvd and enter that casino entrance. Then it'll be to your left).  So glad there was a sign that stated if you had a party of ___ or more head to the hostess stand, rather than them making you wait in line. We had a party of 9, 35-40 wait which was expected, and they offered to text us when our table was ready. I love that feature! We were able to shop around beforehand.  The restaurant is well decorated with a HUGE fire sculpture that talks up a whole wall in front. The tables seem to be pretty close each other, but very big with comfortable spacious seating. Give and take! I loved the menu presentation and the selection of burgers, fries, and appetizers- Very Gordon Ramsay!   We tried a little of everything: sweet potato fries, gooey fries, regular fries, truffle fries, hells kitchen burger, euro burger, salads, & American burger.  **my favorites were the truffle fries, and euro burger! However the Hell's Kitchen burger is also full of flavor, and the gooey fries are heaven when it comes to cheese loaded French fries! Careful, some people say the burgers are small. I thought it was, until I realized I was full from fries and had to take half of my burger home!   The only thing they could have done better was work on getting food out at the same time. Our server had gotten all food out except for one (which was the salad) which left us waiting to eat, and she forgot a couple drinks/refills. But once everything was out, service went smoothly.   PS. They do things for birthdays! The birthday boy got a cool ice cream/cake push pop with a lit candle for us to celebrate!"}
{"text":"Killa burger and fries.... Nice decor and scene... Plenty of flames !! Pricey but hey its Vegas"}
{"text":"\"2 scollops! 3 beef welligtons! How long?!!\" Hahaha I love watching Gordon Ramsay get mad. When I saw this place, I knew I have to try it - see what GR is all about.   His fame is pretty legit by the looks of the line for BurGR - we waited a good 1+hour in line. Then waited 30mins for our burgers to come.  - chanterelle burGR: yum! Figgy onion, mushroom, beef patty, arugula - truffle fries: the truffle is in the dipping sauce, not sprinkled over the fries like Umami burger style - onion rings: this is a must try. So good. The sauce too! So good.  Overall... It was worth it. I would wait this long again the second time though. I feel like the staff is not quick enough with cleaning up the dirty tables, hence the humongous line outside."}
{"text":"Dined here with about a group of 13 people. Each of us ordered something different with burgers and had multiple truffle fries, just fries, and sweet potato fries. The fries were sooooo good! You cannot stop yourself from grabbing a few more, even though you have reached your max. on food capacity. It was surprise after surprise, when each order came out. Everything tasted so damn delicious and was made for perfection.  To top it off, the pudding shakes are to die for. You have not had a milkshake like this. Share them, hog them for yourselves, engulf them. Just order one and you definitely will not regret this decision."}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves Gordon Ramsay, so it was a must that we try his restaurants when we visited. The burgers are quite pricey here, but definitely worth it. We came here twice during our stay in Vegas and both times, the service & food was amazing!  On both occasions, we had a 15 - 20 minute wait. Others may have to wait longer, but it is worth it.  We ordered the Farm Burger & Hell's Kitchen Burger along with a few sides. The meat melts in your mouth. I would suggest ordering med-rare with a side of jalapeno poppers & truffle fries. They are to die for!  You will not be disappointed. If I am ever in Vegas again, this will definitely be a stop I will have to make."}
{"text":"impressed.  burgers were solid.  went with a buddy and after we each finished our burger, we ordered another to share as our dessert."}
{"text":"Went in to get the hog burger. And boy was it good!! shake #4 creme brulee and oreo shake was fantastic too! We waited in line for like half an hour and it was definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had... That's a bold statement!!!!! I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger.  My husband had the Farm burger. Both were equally amazing.  And we got the Parmesan Truffle fries. So so good.  Usually,  I put salt,  pepper, hot sauce on my food. ... Didn't need to add any of that to my burger.  We went last Sunday around 6 pm. Waited 35 minutes. .. But whatever.... You got the miracle mile shops to pass the time. Worth the wait!!!!    Our server was helpful, fun, and the fries and drinks come out quick.   HIGHLY recommended to those that love good food."}
{"text":"Great food, good people, one thing and only one thing. Ticket time from order to being served, 35 minutes. Okay maybe two things, we ordered a side and we got the fries at the same time as the food..... that was kinda a bummer! From one restaurant owner to another, maybe less people will hold everyone more accountable, focused. CHEERS!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 7 and waited for 2 hours to be seated on a Saturday night without a reservation - we sat down to eat at 10 p.m. (not complaining just explaining that yes, it's that long to wait).  It's cool because they use a text messaging system to notify you about 10 minutes ahead of time before you are about to be seated.  And when they say it's going to take about 1:45 to 2 hours, they are not kidding at all.    The food was great.  The waiter initially was good.  The appetizers came out in a flash, drinks as well.  Then as someone said in their review things went a little downhill.  One of the helpers was really great - the one who brought us our drinks.  But the other one who helped bring out plates or whoever she was - was like some sort of bulldog on a mission.  I respect being in a hurry but I'm sorry, we did not wait 2 hours to be treated like we're an inconvenience.  Right before our food came to us,  I noticed there was this woman sort of training some other girl who helped out with our table - she hadn't helped before that so it was sort of confusing who was helping us - our waiter did let us know one girl was helping with plates but it wasn't her.  The woman who came up as a surprise to help was very gruff (dark straight hair, a little above her shoulders - looked older than the others).  For example, when we asked for silverware (this is just one example btw) and asked for a couple of knives and forks (because gee we didn't have any), she came back with a bunch of knives and one fork and dumped them next to my sons plate then quickly walked away.  Short of saying \"here, now quit bothering me because I have this girl following me around the restaurant.\"  Also another time, when she brought out the two missing sweet potato fries, she wedged them on the table not asking where they should go and sort of just pushed things aside without asking who they were for or apologizing for those who's plates she was pushing around.  Then she also had no eye contact or the care to ask if we needed anything else (maybe asking us and helping is not her job - I'm not sure).  Before that, one of the servers took away the iPad that they give you to place your dessert order without asking the adults or anyone at the table if we placed our orders.  The idea of the iPad is to place your dessert order ahead of time I guess - to add that sort of technology flare but it's basically a clunky overzealous menu in my opinion.  None of us had any room to put the thing anywhere on the table so it was a hot potato cumbersome annoyance.  Not a big deal but you add that with the lady dumping silverware next to my kids dinner plate among other little things, all the nit picky things that I sort of overlooked after waiting two hours to be seated come to the surface.  My sister's burger was dry (but at the same time when you order it well done you run that risk - but at burGR - is that acceptable?).  Mine was a little dry for medium and pink but I was fine with it.  The food was good (I have more positive things to say towards the end here).   Our waiter was good overall so don't get me wrong.  But don't expect to wait for 2 hours and travel a long way in anticipation of receiving service or an experience that is 5 stars - not if you get the same experience we had anyway.   I want to give this a 4 star but I just think that the food being a little dry and silverware dumping along with a brash helper is not enough to give them 4 stars.  I don't think we will be back but it was cool to be there and try out their food - my boyfriend and I have recently become big Gordon Ramsay fans and HULU has made us watch all the recent Hell's Kitchen, Master Chef, and Hotel Hell episodes (even past ones!).    As for the food, the jalapeno poppers were hotttt (but so good) - the jalapeno's are fresh and not frozen - we love that Gordon Ramsay believes in fresh foods.  The onion rings were pretty good too.  (Had to throw in some positive and things to suggest before I end this sort of meh review).  And also my 12-year old son who is a burger lover turned to me after the first bite of his American Burger and looked me in the eyes and said, \"This.  Is.  Delicious.\"  So I feel it was worth the wait (we shopped while we waited) but expect to be a little irritated by some unacceptable service glitches, personality flaws and maybe burgers that are a little dry."}
{"text":"Unexpectedly terrific. Wasn't expecting such as several named restaurants we've been to over the years have mildly disappointed us. Not here. BurGR did a nice, nice job. Our server was engaging, enthusiastic, friendly, warm - sincerely so. Burgers cooked spot on. Flavorful. My wife ordered very well done and without the bun. That's exactly what she received and burger was wrapped in lettuce pods. Solid beer menu. Cream soda too. Truffle fries just right. Not overpowering. If you want a solid meal, reasonably priced, attentive service, in a bustling, but nice atmosphere, look no further than BurGR."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I have had.  The meat was cooked perfect.  It was very juicy.  The truffle fries were also really good.   I would highly recommend.  If you want to avoid the lines get there before 11am!"}
{"text":"Definitely a must-have for lunch my wife is a humongous fan of Chef Gordon Ramsay and we was not going to leave Las Vegas without having some of his food now we can honestly say I think the man knows what the hell he's doing I'm not a big fan of wings but I honestly got to say those were really good and the burgers were awesome good cut of beef"}
{"text":"I had the Farm burger. Who can resist something that includes duck fat bacon?! It was good, but prepare yourself... The bacon is actually duck. So, while I was dreaming of crunchy bacon dipped in duck fat, what I got was soft, duck fat in bacon-like strips on top of my burger.   Just Fries were delicious and one order is plenty for two, even three people.   I topped it off with a chocolate carmel pudding shake. Good, but I like Holstein's shakes better."}
{"text":"Like most of you - fan of Gordon Ramsay - his shows of Hell's kitchen, Masterchef,  Masterchef junior,  nightmare kitchen etc. I wanted to check this place out.  My friends have tried it before me and said it was good.   Well,  either my expectations were too high or I went on a wrong day (which should never be the case for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant), i was not blown away.   I had the chanterelle burger and my husband ordered the farm burger - they were both good but the burgers tasted a little dry.   I feel bad saying this but it was nothing to write home about.  I prefer shake shacks' burgers over this one and my husband preferred five guys over this one.    Don't get me wrong,  if you just want a burger with not much expectation, then this is good enough.  But I'm sure you can get cheaper burgers with similar or better taste burgers.   For the burger fanatics out there,  you might be disappointed.    The awesome tasting portion of the meal was the milk shake - it was like an explosion of taste in your mouth. I definitely would recommend it.  The ambiance and the decorations in there is definitely nice to look at and great place to take a date - if you do the dating thing in sin city strip area that is. For those interested, the waitresses wore very short dresses so appropriate for sin city."}
{"text":"Decent burgers. The portions and price are okay for it being vegas. It's a nice option for a casual group dinner. We were able to put our name down on a sunday night for 6 people and only had to wait about 45 minutes. I liked that they just called us when our table was ready so we didn't have to stay by the restaurant.  I got the chanterelle burger and it was pretty tasty. Unfortunately none of their burgers come with any sides so I highly recommend the truffle tries. They were delicious and one order is sharable amongst 2 people."}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how much I loved this restaurant! I'm a diehard Gordon Ramsay fan and have vowed to eventually visit all of his restaurants around the world! Last visit in Vegas I went to Steak (which was mouth-wateringly delicious) and this time in Vegas I convinced a few friends of mine to come with me to have the best burGRs of their lives! It was my husband's birthday and there was quite a wait but it didn't even matter because of what was to come (plus your in the great planet hollywood resort and casino with tons to do while you wait). We started our meal off with the jalapeño poppers which were such a treat! You get six delicious jalapeño poppers and one of the six is a \"surprise\" (all of its stems and seeds, which create the heat, remain in the jalapeño). I was so excited to get the surprise jalapeño since my idol GR claims that the one who gets the surprise popper is the lucky one in Vegas. Nice personal touch! Moving on the star dish! I had the Euro BurGR and I usually like my meat medium but I took a risk and had medium rare as the chef recommends and it was something I do not regret in the least bit! It was the juiciest burGR I've ever had! All of the different elements and ingredients perfectly harmonized together. From the toasted black and white sesame seeds on top of the bun to the oven roasted tomato and goat cheese which added a zingy taste of heaven in my mouth. The arugula and truffle aioli were just the perfect touch to the perfect burGR. I also tried the uber cheese burGR which my husband had ordered and it was just as amazing. Gooey ooey cheese stretched for miles on end with every scrumptious bite. The onion rings were the perfect amount of crisp and came with amazing chipotle ketchup. This is definitely a place that I'd go back to the next time I'm in Vegas and I can't wait for my final stop restaurant of Gordon Ramsay's Pub & Grill! I really can't wait to visit all of his restaurants eventually and maybe my fourth time in Vegas he'll open another one! That would be phenomenal just like him and his success!"}
{"text":"Friday night the line was super long.   Waitress was friendly.  We ordered burgers and shared one order of the truffle fries.  The wait for the burger was long too.  But everything was really tasty. We had the farm burger and the Euro burger had goat cheese. A real acquired taste."}
{"text":"I hate to sound like a snob,but even though the burgers were very good,I have had better.The jalapeño poppers were the best I have ever had,parmisan fries were awesome,and oh my god make sure you save room for one of the layered shakes! Impressive beer list as well.Prices were not bad for being on the strip,but I didn't feel like the burger I got was worth 18 dollars.And also,the portion sizes for the fries is fairly large and enough for 2 people to share.I would recommend making a reservation because the line can be pretty long.We had to wait over an hour,but it was worth it and we will be back."}
{"text":"This Ramsay restaurant is located inside Planet Hollywood vegas. I decided to check it, why not it's Ramsay's menu.  I was dining alone and there wasn't much wait around 5pm. I was sat in the middle of the restaurant in view of the kitchen and the TVs airing football.  Con, if you are short you will be uncomfortable sitting down.  Atmosphere is sports bar-ish. The menu is American with a twist. I ordered the American burger with fries. The burger was cooked to perfection and the fries were fine. The service alright. Waitress was busy at times flirting and hugging the guy waiter.  Finally, flagged her down and asked for my check. Bit pricey but it's Vegas. 33$ total which included a soda.   my list. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Pros: I had a very good experience with their food. We ordered two burgers, Jalapeno poppers and the Bao buns.  Cons: cold waiters + price ( 95$ including tip +two beers)"}
{"text":"My family and I came here after a long day. We all really love the burgers. Great taste , they came out to our liking.  The only thing I would say was bad is the waitress. She was kinda slow."}
{"text":"My housemates and I love watching Master Chef, so a visit to BurGR is a must on our Vegas checklist. Our party of 5 waited a bit more than an hour for a table, which is fine granted this is dinner on Friday night in Vegas. I give this place 4 stars because:  +truffle fries and the sauces are to die for!! +waiter was very kind and patient and knowledgeable of the menu +I tried the euro burger, which is delicious if you like goat cheese. I think it really brings out the medium rare taste of the meat. Friends had the farm burger and chanterelle, which was both amazing as well.  +it is evident that every detail of this place had thought put into it, from silverware to the menu to what the waiters and waitresses wore. Gordan Ramsay puts perfection above my expectations.   The only con about this dining experience was the long wait after we ordered our food. I felt as if I waited longer than the time it took me to eat my dinner.   Overall, if you're in Vegas and you are a fan of burgers, try BurGR and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Burger joint inside Planet Hollywood on the Vegas strip.  Came here for lunch one day on a recent trip to Vegas with the fam at the recommendation of others.  Being vegetarian, we were hopeful there were some veggie burger options and lucky for us there were!  You can have them make any of the burgers using a mushroom patty.  My husband and I split the Uber cheese burger and my parents split the Hell's kitchen burger.  Both were good-not great.  We also got an order of the truffle fries  and the hummus.  The waitress was raving about the hummus, however we all kinda thought it just tasted like any hummus you buy from the grocery store.  By far the best part of the meal was the shake that we got to split-chocolate hazelnut pudding, coffee shake, and praline cookie-holy yum!  It was amazeballs.  I would go back just for the shake!  This is a good place if you're looking for a quick meal while gambling at Planet Hollywood, however I would most likely not go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Majority of us know who Gordon Ramsey is, and what he is known for, so when a restaurant is created by him I expect nothing but his version of perfection... and that is what I received.    The burger itself is crafted so delicately, you can tell there was much thought put into how flavors would combine. Being the plain Jane I am, I love simplicity so I opted for the American burger which is their simplest and was $14. I expected the old plain cheeseburger with tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, and onions but I got a little more. The pickles are sweet (so if you HATE butter pickles I suggest you ask for no pickles) which gave the burger a whole different pizazz. It was your classic, with a little twist. Also, the tomato wasn't cut into slices, more like 4th's with the skin on and everything which was pretty cool. I asked for my meat cooked medium and I got exactly what I asked for! The patty was a light pink and super flavorful. My mom, who loves her meat well done, said although it was well done it still had tons of flavor.   One thing I would like to mention is that you have to order everything separate. Fries do not come with your burger. Fries were about $8 per basket but it comes with quite a lot, enough to feed 2 people.   The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic, besides it being in a smoky casino, but hey... it's Vegas! The servers are super friendly, funny, and on top of it. There's no dress code so don't think you have to get too fancy to eat here.   Overall, I loved it here, and hope to come back some day to try their fantastic looking shakes! I would definitely recommend it to a friend and Gordon Ramsey fans."}
{"text":"Big Big fan of Gordan Ramsay. Came here to Vegas with some family for birthday celebration. Honestly, everything was pretty good. Truffle fries were yum! But for some reason, I don't feel that this meal was super memorable. I was really expected to be blow away. But there were items on the menu that I plain out didn't like. Like the fois gras burger. Personally I love fois gras, but I dont think those flavors he put together goes well together. It was too much. As we sat there, we got a view of the burning wall with the restaurant name, so I feel that he build the right excitment. The line was always line as well. I hope to dine in one of his other restaurants over seas soon, to get the real taste of his own personal menu."}
{"text":"I must say I hate writing a bad review. 30 minute wait was not too bad. The waitress was fantastic and the Decour was great. The food tasted delicious. But when my wife found a hair in her burger and it took the manager 10 minutes to get to us and he had the nerve to ask if it was her hair, we were pretty insulted. He took off the price of the burger I wasn't looking for much more but was terribly disappointed in how to handled that. His name is Jeffrey and I was getting angrier by the minute, we were not even offered dessert and I wouldn't of wanted it at that point I was so angry so we just left."}
{"text":"The jalapeño poppers to start off are legit Careful might be kinda spicy . I ordered\" the hell kitchen burger \"I could of took a picture but I was too hungry food kinda took a while to get out but all in all good atmosphere good food. Will most likely come back."}
{"text":"First off our server kaysea was just on point and she was really nice. The food was cooked perfectly and service was very fast and attentive. I got the hells kitchen burger and let me tell you it was the best burgr I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pros: - Great burger (pork) - Amazing jalapeno poppers - Decent shake (too much quantity and could not finish it off - better to share).  Cons: Long wait."}
{"text":"really long line for burgur, but its pretty damn good!!  dined in, had the farm burger truffle fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, toffee pops  all good!! a little pricey but i really enjoyed it  service was great as well, ordered to go a second time late at night near closing time to eat in my room as the line was still long got my food pretty quick!"}
{"text":"Sort of unique to check in and get called in for your table via text message. Also uncommon to order drinks and dessert via an iPad and fill out a survey at the end of the meal on an iPod touch.  Total rewards members get a discount here. It's $1-$2, not a whole lot, but it's something. Our server Alex was very personable and had a great sense of humor and also attentive. We got the Hell's Kitchen burger, Euro burger, and the Truffle Parmesan fries. The Hell's Kitchen Burger isn't super spicy but you get the kick in some of the bites. The avocado definitely help balance the jalapeno. You can really taste cheese in the Euro burger, which may bother some, but I loved it! . The meat in both burgers were very high quality. We both ordered it medium and it came out juicy. The fries were absolutely amazing. It was so good and the portion is pretty big for what it is! However, I have to admit that halfway through, the fries and the burgers started tasting a little too salty so make sure you have enough water or drinks by your side.  Twas a good experience. We're still debating if we want to spend $50+ on two burgers, fries and a beer when we pay a similar amount for AYCE sushi. BF ranks the burgers second to the Morton prime rib burger, so you know it's good."}
{"text":"Okay.. so no 4 stars because... I hated the burger bun. it's hard, it's not tasty, it's not special and it's dry.  Also, the fries, although TASTY..were EXTREMELY salty.   Highlights: sweet potato fries and that sweet jalapeno sauce.. dude. heaven. HEAVEN. milkshakes. any milkshakes. don't be afraid of that delish pudding they put on top of there either. I'm lactose intolerant and I thought I'd be okay but they must you quality ingredients in there because my stomach hurt so bad that night...but it was worth it. my actual burger was pretty good, i forgot what I got but it's the egg. Let me rephrase this.. the ingredients and the INSIDE was good, I was just underwhelmed with the quality of the bun. I tried some of the other burgers my friends got and they were good too- but once again.. turned off by the bread they had. My burger was cooked a little more than what I requested- medium rare, but I did that on purpose because I knew if I ordered a medium, it would end up medium well. I think chefs are afraid of cooking meat medium rare especially on the west coast bc we can't handle rare meat like people in europe and the east coast does.   I'd still come here for those damn sweet tater fries and milkshakes.  Don't let the line fool you- it looks long but it goes relatively quick."}
{"text":"\"OvR\" Rated ****************    After rolling out of bed at 2 PM during my Vegas weekend, I felt like getting a  greasy burger to counter my hangover.  I am always skeptical about hyped up burgers from famous chefs.  Quite honestly, I chose this place because it was easy walking distance.  We bypassed the line and sat at the counter.     The decor and service were pretty good.   I ordered the  \"Hell's Kitchen burger,\" one of their more popular burgers.  It was good, but just OK.   Truffle Parmesan fries were pretty good.    Good thing I came at the hour I did, because there was a sizable line forming.    Overall, I would not come back again.  If you are interested in a tasty burger without the waiting,   I actually recommend Holsteins at the Cosmopolitan.  Its a hidden gem.  Delicious"}
{"text":"i had never been to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I only knew him by his cocky, angry, and inappropriate presence on television. I thought it would be worth a try anyway. My bf has tried his restaurant in London and enjoyed it.  Loved my Hell's Kitchen burger. The bread-to-meat ratio was great. The bread itself was thick, but not TOO thick. I liked how it was seeded too. Meat was cooked perfectly, and was a hefty amount of meat (but not overpowering). Other veggies inside included avocado (glad it wasn't an add on, like lots of burger places do, b/c I may not have ordered it to be honest. However I think the avocado is vital and signature to the Hell's kitchen burger. I also liked the hint of jalapenos inside! I never think to put peppers on my burger, but I'm glad he did.  Fries - onion rings were huge and good. We also ordered the parmesan truffle fries, which were great!!!  Drinks - It is my pet peeve when drinks are presented to you in the form of an iPad. To be honest, I just want to see ALL of the drinks in one menu, front and back. I don't want to have to flip through an iPad, not knowing who touched it right before me. Also the layout of their particular drink menu was frustrating - there are several pictures of a drink, and you have to press each drink for the image to flip around and see the ingredients. It just takes a long time, and could be executed a lot quicker with a cardstock paper. I arrived to Vegas just a few hours prior, and wanted a drink PRONTO - didn't want to fuss through a stupid iPad. That being said, my Skinny Acai Lemonade drink was delicious, surprisingly!! It was pretty strong, and by the end of the meal I had a great buzz going.  Service was a little weird. They would take an empty chair from the table of 3 next to us, and haul it over to a table across the room to accommodate a table of 5. I think they should just get it from the back, because it makes that table of 3 look and probably feel awkward. Also we wanted tap water, and he gave us bottled water. Just some miscommunication here and there. Also, we didn't see our waitress, but wanted to order. We flagged someone down, and the hostess told us, \"Wait for your waiter to take your order.\" Like, really? Just little things here and there that show that service isn't the best, but oh well, what does one really expect? It's just a burger place I supposed. Gordon Ramsay isn't known for the best customer service anyway lol.  Also, one more comment, the prices were pretty good for this place. Considering the quality of the burger, and portions, it was totally worth it. It was $15, which was really not bad for the excellent quality it was. Great place to go with friends too."}
{"text":"holy bejesus, Gordon Ramsay never continues to amaze me. (shout out to Will V. Vleck!!!) Having tried Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill, my next stop on the Gordon Ramsay groupie tour was GR BurGR. After a fast 25 minute wait, my brother and I were seated and greeted by the General manager.   I ordered the Euro Burger and my brother ordered the Hog Burger (the waiter raved nonstop about it) and two sides of Parmesan truffle fries.  Both Euro and Hog Burgers were amazing. The protein was cooked perfectly and complimented the garnish, cheese and bun. While I loved my Euro Burger, I still thought the burger at GR Pub & Grill was superior (that burger was possibly the best burger I ever had). But my brother loved his  Hog Burger and reviewed it as the BEST BURGER he's ever had.  the truffle fries? oh yeah, ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. Staff here puts an absurd amount of Parmesan cheese, an ingredient that I adore greatly. One order of fries is honestly enough to serve two tabletop, because the portions are enormous.   two burgers + two fries= $60. SUCCESS!"}
{"text":"The jalapeño poppers, wings, and truffle fries are a must!!! All the burgers are tasty and flavorful. Amazing place"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant and after a thirty minute wait I really wanted to hate it. Truth of the story is I loved it the wait was way worth it. I started with the Ceasar salad dressing on side was surprisingly good. Then I had some onion rings now usually I hate beer battered onion rings but those were good too. So I ordered the Britannia burger with chutney. Yes I said chutney, fucken chutney, on an burger and it was fucken phenomenal. My wife got a burger with goat cheese on it, can you believe that? I was like really goat cheese? It was good too. The sweet potato fries were good.  The only thing that was not ok was the regular fries, they need some season salt. Oh yea also the shakes are good too. So all in all come to Gordon burger spot it's worth it. I would give it 5 but I spent over 120$ for 2 bugers, two fries, a pork belly, Ceasar salad, onion rings & two shakes."}
{"text":"Let me start with our orders: first off was the app - the deep fried Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings loaded with Parmeggiano Reggiano served with 2 dips - chipotle ketchup and ranch cheddar. Great flavors at the onset, but one can only eat a few because, then, the very rich flavors can be overwhelming, like biting on butter. Unfortunately, our order of deep fried French Fries became equally overwhelming. As for our main burger dinner, we ordered the Farm Burger with Duck Breast Bacon, an excellent choice. We also ordered the Euro Burger with Truffle Aioli. The rich flavor was also quite overwhelming but somewhat offset by the saltiness of the goat cheese. Our third burger was the 'secret' menu, Gordon Ramsay Special Burger. It had an exceptional flavor but too rich, once again, for my palate due to the combination of cheeses, specialty dressing, and avocados .... the avocados left an after taste that clashed with the flavorful, medium rare burger. It was easily remedied by simply removing the avocados from the sandwich. Our last order was the Crème brûlée shake. It was great but can be eaten only in small, savory, scoops. The rich, creamy flavor can also be quite overwhelming - best shared by 2.  Service was great even though it was full and crowded. Our glasses kept getting refilled and wait staff were quite attentive from beggining to end, not snobbish. It was a very well managed establishment.  I would still come back and try different items from their menu and be more cognizant of the food pairings, and probably order red wine instead of a soda."}
{"text":"Failure  We were very excited to eat at this restaurant and were not deterred by the line being 25 people long. The line moved quickly and we were seated anticipating an excellent meal.  We placed drink orders and and appetizer contemplating our meal selections. The first issue was the plate that was placed in front of me was dirty. No big deal it happens but after the main course arrived a \"Hells kitchen burger\" with added duck bacon,  and the appetizer was not still delivered I started to wonder.  I ordered the burger to be medium rare, and it was raw in the middle.  I sent it back and the manager came by and was very apologetic and 10 minutes later presented me with a hamburger that was medium well done without any duck bacon.   At this point I gave up! The kitchen had two chances to make a decent burger and they could not.  In addition the truffle fries were bland and thick cut. Blah, not good.   While we were compensated for the appetizer and the hamburger not being correct we left very disappointed. Shocked that GR allows this to represent his brand.  Bad Show."}
{"text":"Burgers are a bit small for the price.  I wasn't blown away by what was served here.  Everything is almost a la carte so expect to spend about $20 a person just for the food (no drink, tax or tip)  Food also took awhile to come out.  Not too crazy about this place."}
{"text":"LIKES: food, service, use of technology, value DISLIKES: the server's outfits  [Background:] Went here in December 2013 with my boyfriend, before a show. We made no reservations at 8 p.m., but the wait was less than 10 minutes.  We also had a Total Rewards card that gave us a dollar off each menu item --- score!   This restaurant is located inside Planet Hollywood. Very easy to find as it is on The Strip.   The ambiance was warm and very casual. Other diners were young, old, purple and blue --- everyone is welcome.   BUT, I didn't really like the servers' uniforms. It was a weird sporty look with sneakers. I thought something more classic (collared shirt? Nice pants? A mid-length skirt?) would've projected a casual vibe too. It was a bit more McDonald's for me...Oops. Don't think they were going for that.  [Food:] Got a suggestion from our server to choose the Farm Burger. And my boyfriend did! I picked the Hells Kitchen burger to try their house special.  My boyfriend deemed the Farm Burger \"the best\" he's ever tasted. Ever. And he loves burgers. It was the perfect taste, great meat to bread to everything else in between ratio.  The Hells Kitchen burger was probably the best I've ever tasted too, and I am not usually a burger eater. It was very easy to enjoy, a light burger yet very savoury. I couldn't finish it though, so I had half of it the next day. Still tasted delicious---and I am very picky.  The burgers, however, do not come with fries. You order that separately. We got the Hawaiian onion rings instead. These were so amazing --- batter was light and the portions were huge! It didn't make us feel sick of eating onion rings after the 1038th bite.  [Service:] Excellent! Just the perfect amount of friendliness. Our servers (we had a change up in the middle of our service) were so casual, yet very professional. We didn't feel intimidated even though it was Gordon Ramsay's restaurant! Ha. Ha. Ha. The REAL Gordon Ramsay. Well, he would've been proud since he was well-represented by his people at BURGR.  Loved the use of technology too! There was an iPad presented to us to look over the drinks and appies. We also got to rate our experience for the night via an iPhone attached to the receipt folder thing. Very innovative.  [Value:] Okay. Confession: We got a souvenir...for free! We kept the menus. Oops. The server said we could. I swear! We were so excited over the fact that we ate at this restaurant that the server said we should keep the menus as souvenir. That's pretty good value!  Oh, the food & drinks were obviously great value too! We ended up paying about $50 plus tips for two gourmet burgers, two beers and onion rings. Not bad at all! And full, we were. Very.  [Verdict:] LOVE IT. You must go! It has set the standards for all of my burger consumption from here on. Totally lived up to Gordon Ramsay's name...and now I heart Gordon even more."}
{"text":"The restaurant is really nice didnt care for how we were seated which was side by side barely any room and when we asked for another chair so one of us could sit on the opposite side they told us we have no more chairs after looking around I noticed another waitress stacking chairs on the side and moving them towards the back no extra chairs my butt. Moving on to the food it was good not omg good but it was a experience, when in Vegas your suppose to try new things but unfortunately its not a place I will be trying again I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Here's whatcha do. You get yourself some sweet potato fries, a Shake #1 and a chanterelle burger (rare). Then you dip the fries into the LAYER OF PUDDING on the top of the shake and before that sweetness dissipates, you jam a fistful of buttery smooth ground cow right up in your face.  Repeat until you've cleaned your plate, glass and cone of salty sweet shame.  THEN you stand up, punch a security guard right in the sack and run for it. Because you're going to need the adrenaline-fueled sprint from PH to, oh, let's say Golden Nugget to work off the calories."}
{"text":"I am not a burger person at all. But this place GOES. Not a whole lot to say here. Food is hot, flavorful, and delicious! Wow! So tender, soft and packed with flavor.   We ordered the farm house burger. Whoa! Delicious! A side of jalapeño poppers that were super spicy but soooooo good!! We also had an order of onion rings that were really good too.   The presentation of the food was quite nice. The atmosphere is really cool. The servers are super friendly and very knowledgable. Also, the food came out fast. Not to mention, the drinks were quite tasty too.   The only downfall is that there can be a line and quite a wait before you get seated. No reservations. First come, first serve. But hey, what do you expect when you are about to eat really good food? Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay Burgr is the perfect place to satisfy your hungr.  Their general managr stops by your table to ensure your experience is excellent.  The truffle fries are dangr. Dangrously trufflicious.  The hog burgr blew my socks away and was a unique, never before taste for my pathetically inexperienced taste buds.  Their milkshakes induce angr. Angr because you can't have an infinite supply of them.  Service is quite nice. Oh so very nice.  Their food brings all the boys to the yard.  Gordon Ramsay is a culinary genius and I certainly want to eat at more of his fine sanctuaries of delectable delights."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay's hamburger restaurant belongs in Vegas. It's a showy affair, with some unexpected surprises and also some gambles that don't pay totally pay off. Much of the personality of this restaurant comes from the TV celebrity chef's personality, and they know it. Ramsay is staring at you from every surface and hangs over the dining room like a potentially not so benevolent overlord. It's a version of upscale cuisine for the masses of food television watchers rather than true food lovers. But watching a spectacle can still be fun if you give in and go with the show.  We had a group of nine, so we knew there would be a wait. We went at noon on a Saturday, and the wait was about an hour, but they will text you when your seat is ready, so we were able to walk around the casino for awhile while we waited.   We had still had drinks from our walk when our table was ready, and they allowed us to bring those in and offered to return the glasses to housekeeping (we were staying at the hotel) instead of us having to carry them back, so that was nice. The service was impeccable, with tons of servers and support crew so that glasses were always full, someone was always clearing our table or bringing us something, or smiling at us from their Gordan Ramsay monogrammed uniform. The jeans the men wear actually have his logo on the butts, so Ramsay truly is a marketing every aspect.   We started with the jalapeño poppers. The menu promised a \"fiery surprise,\" and we were a little worried about what it might be. Turns out they leave all the seeds in one of the jalapeños, so one of them is extra spicy. You just have no idea which one it is. Of course, the person in our group who can't really handle spicy got it, and we got the pleasure of watching his face turn red. We also ordered the sweet potato fries and the Parmesan truffle fries for the table to share. The sweet potato fries are a little too sweet, once they're dusted with vanilla powdered sugar. It becomes a dessert because there's no balance flavor of spice or tang to counter the sweet. It's the burger joint french fry version of sweet potato casserole with marshmallows. The Parmesan truffle fries were good, but I'm spoiled by having tasted truly great versions of truffle fries. I wasn't blown away. The fries are thick cut, so they don't have any crunch. There is a lot more Parmesan than truffle flavor, with soft, mild parm sprinkled like a thick blanket all over the fries. They both come with some special sauces, and I remember one was an herb aioli, but they were literally not very memorable over all.  I ordered the farm burger and a blood orange cosmo for lunch. The farm burger is topped with duck breast bacon and a fried egg. The flavors are good, and the ingredients seem fairly high quality. The duck bacon was good, and not too, too fatty as duck sometimes can be. It still doesn't get very crispy. The flavor kind of melts in your mouth, with a pleasant amount of fatty feeling. It does that without being too greasy or overwhelming, even with a thick layer of bacon strips. The egg was cooked a little too long and the yolk wasn't runny at all. It all stayed in perfect stacks as I ate through the burger, never once turning into the messy, runny affair a fried egg burger can be. It was good, but part of the fun is the messy, runny yolk that would normally make a rich sauce over the burger.   Everyone in my party was pleased with our meal. The hot dogs were massive, the soba noodles featured a spicy chicken side. One thing I appreciate is that they don't hold back on the spicy. The other flavors featured on the menu are more about creamy and fatty meat flavors, so the spice is a nice touch, and sharpens some of the meals pleasantly. Just enjoy the show and being over the top, and you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"To me , being to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant was the most favorite thing to do as I am his huge fan and yes, no disappointments at all ! The waiting line speaks the glory ! We had to wait for 40 mins.Since it was our first time , I actually read on the internet to find the best burgers. There is a huge list of burgers and it just confuses me. So I went with the Farm burger and my husband opted the Hell's Kitchen burger. They were just right . And for the appetizers we ordered the hot pork pockets & onion rings. The pockets were so tasty , and the onion rings were okay okay since I'm not a big fan of it. And for the deserts, we actually deviated from the internet advice which stated that the shake#4 was the special. We got the toffee pudding push ups. It was real fun to have it twist n twirl all the way up little by little. We totally loved our very first experience at GR burger restaurant! Not pricey, lip smacking burgers ! All I wanted :)"}
{"text":"I'm always at PH when I'm in Vegas and there's always a wait for BurGR, so this time, we decided to try it.  I ordered the Farm Burger and the truffle fries. The Farm Burger was good. Not great, and definitely did not live up to the hype. It was made well and the duck breast is unique, but it was literally just duck, egg, cheddar, and bun. It was too plain in my opinion.  The truffle fries was yummy, but a little too thick in my opinion. I like my fries skinnier! Also, the ketchup and aioli are homemade and have unique tastes. My friends wanted to ask for normal Heinz ketchup but thought that would be embarrassing.  Overall, I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"If you watch the TV show, Hell's Kitchen, you will be familiar with this chef, Gordon Ramsay. I came here late night last time and I loved it. I was going to take my sister to try this place.   On Tuesday night around 6:30pm, there was a line in the front. If you had a party more than two, you could skip the line. Well, it didn't work for us, we waited for 30 minutes. It was trendy and busy with an open kitchen. After you sat down, the server came to drop an iPad with information if you were interested in any drinks or desserts. We ordered Hell's Kitchen Burger, Farm Burger, sweet potato fries and Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings. We both loved our burgers and sides tasted delicious. I loved the presentation and always loved an fried egg on my food!  The server was attentive, friendly and helpful! The only downside was the wait which was too long for two people on a weekday nights.   Love this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is \"wow!\"  Beyond amazing burgers and fries.  We tired all 3 types of fries and each of us had a different burger. Yum.  Had to wait 30 minutes to get in but totally worth it."}
{"text":"Best Burger to ever touch my mouth haha. Expertly prepared hamburgers that will make you squeal with joy. My taste buds were rejoicing even 4 hours after my scrumptious meal. Must try the 'Hell's Kitchen Burger' and sweet potato fries. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend, we ordered \"The Hog\", \"The Farm\"(?), and the onion rings. The bill + tips came out to be around $50 dollars, but best burger experience I have ever had! I wouldn't spend that much anywhere else AND THE ONION RINGS WERE HEAVENLY. Must try!!"}
{"text":"OK as big Burger fan, I have tried so many burger places. As of the moment i tried Gordon Ramsay's Burger, i am sure now this is the best i have ever tried in my life.  When you have a chance to try this place don't be cheap and think about the money, you will have to try the delicious fresh burgers, with the Parmesan Truffle Fries that is much better than any other place i have tried it at (good size for sharing). At the end the Sticky toffee pudding pops is a must because you will never have something like this or close to it anywhere else. Try these three and then you will know what i am talking about."}
{"text":"We ordered the Gordon Ramsey burger which was not on the menu and shared it - it is a big burger. We also ordered fries & the pork belly buns. The buns are amazing, they were really good. The burger was really good with duck bacon & avocado, we had it with out cheese and my husband and I both thought it needed a bit more sauce. All in all good burger option. We got here before 12 and didn't have to line up."}
{"text":"I must say, Gordon Ramsay does not disappoint! This was by far the best burger we have had! I ordered the American Burger and added bacon. My husband ordered the farm burger. Both were very moist and tasty! The parmesan steak fries were very good too (I usually do not like steak fries because it is too much potato). Be prepared to spend $25 per person, but it is worth it to try once! YOLO"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with Gordon Ramsay's BurGR. Was excited to try it, and was a little disappointed with how salty everything seemed to be."}
{"text":"Ordered the Farm Burger and it was great! Bar staff was attentive and comical which was good for the experience. Eric was very personable and i was impressed with the experience overall.  The fries were okay; especially for $8.  I would rather have order asparagus ;-)"}
{"text":"Brilliant! My first time at a Ramsey location. Superb service. Excellent menu selection. Farm Burger was very good, yummy. Truffle Parm Fries are amazing and worth the upgrade. Great atmosphere and seemingly happy employees all around. I'm definitely coming back my next trip!"}
{"text":"It was OK, nothing major! Just average good compare with a lot places in Las Vegas than deserve 1 star and charge the same."}
{"text":"Got the Farm Burger, Hell's Kitchen Burger, and Parmesan Truffle Fries. Split the burgers 50/50 with the BF. Their Farm Burger was AWESOME. Duck bacon was truly the star in the burger. Also got their Hell's Kitchen Burger, which sounded good on the menu, but didn't shine in reality. Maybe it was because the saltiness from the Farm Burger out-did the subtle textures and tastes of the Hell's Kitchen Burger, particularly the avocado or the roasted tomatoes. Maybe would have been tastier paired with another burger. Definitely get the truffle fries. Couldn't stop eating them. Loved the ketchup (and worcestershire?) sauce. Didn't care so much for the aioli sauce--was too thick and wasn't seasoned well. Servers were all nice and friendly. I think management stresses good and personable service. Definitely gonna go back next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! I had the Hell's Kitchen burger, so yummy! I would come back for sure and try the Farm burger."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best burger places I have been too! The wait tends to be long but don't let it scare you off.   We tried a lot of different items.  Sweet potato fries Truffle Parmesan fries Onion rings Jalapeño poppers The many sauces Hog burger  Hell's Kitchen burger Cheeseburger  Everything was a MUST have. The poppers were the best item by far and the milkshakes are ridiculously amazing as well!!"}
{"text":"I like to consider myself a burger connoisseur of sorts since a good burger is really hard to find these days. But I can honestly say that the burger I had at BurGR was one of the best I've EVER had (tied with Burgers in Paradise in Maui)!! I had a quick dinner at BurGR with a friend who is a vegetarian; I had the Blue Burger and she had the Earth Burger. We also shared an order of the Truffle Parmesan Fries. We both couldn't stop saying how delicious our food was! I'm going back to Vegas in a couple weeks with my husband and I can't wait to take him there.   The line was quite long and we waited about an hour for a table but I would say it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The burger (american classic with cheddar instead of american cheese) was exceptional. The Parmesan and sweet potato fries and jalapeño poppers were yummy, but I think what made the side dishes were the dipping sauces. Also, the presentation of the poppers was very clever. I only gave 4 stars because the wait to get in and for the food to be served was very long (1 1/2 hours to get in, but worth it). Don't go when you're starving, but definitely go."}
{"text":"I travel to Vegas several times a year, and Burgr was on my list of things to do this last trip. I took a couple of friends there with me. We all had the Farm Burger. It was amazing! It was cooked perfectly and had so many flavor profiles. I had really high expectations and they were met! I will be going back next time (August) for sure! Good job Gordon!"}
{"text":"GOOOD BURGERSSS  one star off for the 45 minute wait :("}
{"text":"One of my favorite Vegas spots! Great burgers and fries, a little on the heavy side but delicious.  Took off one star because the wait is insanely long."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I had the farm burger and have no complaints. 4 stars because the line/wait is no joke! The first time we went the wait was 1.5 hours and the hostess said they weren't doing take out until later that day. We didn't stay. The second time we went we were able to grab two seats at the bar right away, but saw the line was at least an hour wait again.   Ordered a Bloody Mary - the bartender made a fantastic one! Perfect amount of vodka, mix, salt, and hot sauce. Service was great. I wish I knew the name of the bartender so I could give him a shout out!"}
{"text":"This was hands down the most delicious burger I've ever had in my entire life! We had a party of 4 and we all ordered different burgers, everyone was in love. The onion rings, fries and shakes were also to die for. This is everything you would expect from a Gordon Ramsay burger restaurant. Note - do not order a salad, it's a waste."}
{"text":"After all the hype few friends and I decided to give it a try. I orderded the hell's kitchen burger my friend ordered another burger and the chicken burger. We also ordered some truffle fries. First it took so long to just get out fries. The burgers realoy didnt have much flavor, the chicken burger was just two pieces of fried chicken in a bun, really disappointing. We ordered chicken wings because it looked good on our neighbor's table, the chicken looked bloody when you get closer to the bone, I ask the server and she said its party of it. The server said maybe we went on a wrong day but I not too sure."}
{"text":"I didn't want to wait, I was starving.  But our friend was so excited, and I didn't want to be Debbie-Downer.  So we waited.  An hour.  Luckily, that food was (as Jesse says) Bangin' Like a Biscuit!  We got all the fries / onion rings they offered - all amazing and the sauces were unbelievable.  I got the chicken sliders, which tasted like pho in a bun (but not Banh Mi), hubby got a burger which was ridiculously dripping with gooey egg magic, and our friend got a sandwich that was just as yummy!  Shake was tall, creamy and yummy.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Man!  The burgers and fries are phenomenal!  It's loud in there but SO much fun!  Service was amazing, but with a long line, we were inside in no time!  I was waiting for Chef Ramsay to walk through at any minute.  RUN do not Walk to the BurGR!!"}
{"text":"Over rated and over priced. Over an hour waiting for food to come out with not even full capacity for this small venue. Fries were luke warm and soggy. Burger had different, original ingredients but overall, still a mediocre burger.  Not impressed. My group agreed Gordon should've been yelling or firing someone in the back behind the line."}
{"text":"Bland burger. Very disappointing. Long wait, bad service, bland food. Gordon Ramsey would have not been happy i can assure you. Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and there was very little spice or flavor. Even had the stem of the jalepeno (the rough non-edible part) in there."}
{"text":"Wait time was 15 minutes on a Friday afternoon, not bad!!! Service extremely friendly and quick! Had the burger with a quail egg freaken amazing! I was skeptical as usual, and after reading some reviews I almost didn't go. But God dayum!!! That burger was full of flavor, every bite hit you back with flavor. Trust me the burger was moist, not with grease, with cheese and yolk you can't go wrong! Honestly I need to stop reading reviews before I go to restaurant, or I would never eat anywhere. So glad I visited Burgr. If you're skeptical and not sure if you should go and need that extra reason or push, well this is it. Go! You won't regret it. Don't even get me started with the sides!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"When I saw the waiting line for dinner outside this place after 9pm I knew I was in good hands :) we got friend calamari as appetizer, and it was pretty tasty with right amount of fried flour. The burger, man, the patty was juicy and full of flavor, it was really really really good!"}
{"text":"Thought this was absolutely a great \"upscale\" burger spot.  We liked everything we got, including the shakes, a variety of burgers, a hot dog, and even the truffle fries!  Everything tasted great, plus they had a nice selection of beers on draft.  The problem was our server.  He was a little too chatty and didn't seem to get the hint that we wanted to watch MARCH MADNESS.  Pretty sure we even told him we had money riding on the halftime score of a game, but this didn't stop him from chatting to us about random topics as the clock counted down to half time and the spread was close to being covered.  We just ignored him.  The other problem was that his chattiness got him into a bit of a bind.  One of our party had half a burger that she asked to have wrapped.  He took it and set it on a table next to ours while he chatted with us about stuff we didn't care about during crucial moments of the game we were watching.  However, he set it on a table that the bus boy was clearing, and I noticed the bus boy remove the burger (or BurGR) with a bunch of napkins on it.  Our server clearly noticed too, because he lunged at it, but was too late and just walked away.  I told the rest of our table what happened, and while we could care less about the half BurGR, we were curious to see how he'd handle it.   He handled it in about the worst way possible.  He came and said, \"Maam, did you happen to see which server took your leftover burger?\"  I was a couple beers in, and said with a grin, \"You did!\"  He said, \"Oh no, no I was chatting with you about your total rewards card.\"  I said, \"We saw *exactly* what happened\" and set forth the details.  The guy turned bright red, but he did offer to cook up another burger and, when we declined, comped us the burger, so that was nice.  Wish he'd just said that there was a mixup and the busboy had taken the burger, but he'd comp it, in the first place, rather than trying some lame cover up!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about Gordon Ramsey's Burgr. I came here with a friend on a Friday afternoon and got seated immediately. Out waitress was nice but extremely awkward. I felt uncomfortable whenever she came by the table. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger cooked medium with no roasted tomatoes. I like getting my burger medium as opposed to medium rare because I don't like the texture of patties when they're medium rare.   The burger came out, and it had tomatoes in it. Luckily tomatoes are easy to take out but would've been out if my order was correct. My burger was also cooked medium well.. Maybe even well done. Definitely not how I wanted it. The burger itself had some nice flavors but nothing spectacular. Don't expect to have your mind blown."}
{"text":"I don't know why people eat here. Really, why?  We waited for an hour and a half. With a wait like that, I expected the best damn burger in the existence of man-kind. Service was sub-par. The hostesses are the worst. They have no idea what's going on and ignore you half the time.  Fries don't come with your burgers, FYI. I wasn't super shocked by this, but was shocked by the price. 8 dollars or more for some fries. They say they feed a group of people. I was with three large, hungry men. Definitely not feeding us all.  I ordered the Brittania burger and an oreo shake. The mango chutney was good but there was hardly any of it. It was a tiny burger, too. I wasn't too upset about it because the shake was so giant.  The shake was... interesting. The creme brulee pudding mostly just tastes like sweet egg pudding. I get that creme brulee is mostly eggs, but it isn't supposed to taste like it. The burger overall was sub-par AT BEST. I was expecting great meat. The meat was ok, I guess. I wasn't wowed with how tender or innovative the place is.  At the end of the night, I was angry. I waited an HOUR AND A HALF to pay $36 for a sub-par meal. Not to mention the food made me sick, literally. I left ill. I went back to my hotel and laid on my bed in the fetal position because I was so sick.  I wouldn't go back unless there was no wait and someone with me (like the people I was with) insisted that it's going to be amazing because it's Gordon Ramsey."}
{"text":"The burgers were great,  I had the Euro and my bestie had the Earth burger. Both were flavorful and just big enough to fill us. We got the Just fries since she is vegan and can't eat cheese. They were okay, just as the name they were just fries, no seasoning and were a little hard, not crunchy but hard. It comes with a chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup, I didn't care for either but she loved them both.   The fries, price, and service were the reasons why it doesn't get 5 stars. Our server took a few minutes to come to the table and different people brought our drinks, food, and the regular ketchup I asked for. They were busy, but as always, if you can't handle a bigger station then maybe they should staff more servers. The 2 burgers, 1 just fries, and 1 ice tea came to almost $50.  At least I had a diamond tier card and didn't have to wait in line."}
{"text":"Ok. I didn't have to pay for this meal. It was a comp gift that was given to me as a wedding present, and will always hold a special place as our first real dinner together as newlyweds. That may influence my opinion a bit.   We had a choice of a bunch of places, but as a fan of the various Ramsay shows, I kind of wanted to try one of the restaurants of his. We started off for the pub, but the lengthy wait and pushy people cutting in the line to check in was extremely off-putting. We'd admired the BurGR theatrics the night before, so decided to 'slum it up' with a burger instead. Sooo glad we did.   The only negative about the experience was the very first encounter. Maybe it is the touristy atmosphere of the strip that makes those reservation desks such a harrowing experience, but if not for my hunger, I may have gotten annoyed and left this restaurant too. There is a long line stretching out from the restaurant, which we had patiently stepped in to wait. As I read everything in my line of sight, I noticed that there was a board asking you to check in with the receptionist before waiting, so stepped out to check in on the procedures. The gal gives me this disgusted look and quotes a wait time at me with an attitude, as if I am inconveniencing her by following the damn instructions. I harrumphed back to my spot in line, but was too tired and hungry to want to argue a third restaurant. I found out later that apparently they also do text messages to alert you when your table is ready? I don't know why she didn't offer that as my feet were sore from all the running around pre/post wedding, but whatever. Every hiccup just helps illuminate the quality of food, as if you can recover from that negativity, you've got to be good!   Once our delightful server sat us, I felt better. The cocktail menu was fun and high tech and having stood next to the interactive menu board outside for what felt like forever, we already knew our orders. The atmosphere in the restaurant was just as vibrant on the inside as it looked to be from admiring the theatrics from the outside.   Without worrying about cost, we went full force. I started off with the Gin Green Tea cocktail and we ordered the hummus and truffle french fries as appetizers. I could have ended the meal there. I had been worried about choosing a cocktail over the amazing looking beer list, but I can't resist a new gin based drink. The Gin Green Tea was an explosion of delightful flavors, that perfectly compliment the use of gin instead of trying to pretend it is a last minute substitute for some lesser alcohol. (I may be a bit biased about my gin, but my rum loving husband later agreed that it was the best drink in the house)  The hummus was, in a word, divine. I'd had some lackluster hummus leading up to this meal, and my tastebuds could have died and gone to heaven the minute I tried that perfectly textured, richly flavored concoction. In fact, I want more now, just thinking about it. I wondered about the truffle fries, as I swear I've heard more than one celebrity chef - and maybe even Ramsay - harp on the gimmicky nature of  using such an expensive ingredient on the most mundane things. But it worked well on the fries and balanced nicely with whatever heavenly version of ketchup came with it. Seriously, I've never been so happy to eat fries and ketchup in my life.   As my fella' made the mistake of texting our Ramsay loving friend the awesomeness of our meal, I took the opportunity to dig heavily in to the appetizers, a decision I do not regret in the slightest. By the time our burgers came out, I was so satisfied I could only manage a few bites. I had picked out the Britannia burger as I love Mango Chutney. It was extremely tasty, but I wouldn't mind trying another burger some time when my stomach isn't already too full to really note the taste of what I'm eating. My only note on the food from eating the leftover burger would be that I feel like I would have liked a bit more chutney. Still, I probably could have asked for some if I'd actually noticed that night and I imagine as chutney isn't a very American thing, most folks probably prefer it on the lighter side.   Overall, it was a delightful experience that met up to my high expectations. Everything came out extremely promptly, the server was a paragon of efficiency and service, and the food was delicious. I see a lot of folks complaining about price, but for a high end burger joint with a celebrity chef at the helm in the middle of tourist central, it seemed extremely reasonable. The man and I each had several drinks, two appetizers and the burgers for just at the $100 mark, which we were aiming for. We probably won't come back all the time or anything, but I already am looking forward to future date night/special occasions here."}
{"text":"Great service... Good food.. To much salt on everything for my taste.. But I think that's me.. I'm pretty picky over burgers.. It was good, the onion rings were great... And I had a banana butterscotch shake.. I also don't do sweets... I only have a sip or two.. Seriously.., but it was so good... For a burger place .. Would have gotten 5 stars, but the seats are so low.. I didn't understand it."}
{"text":"Another awesome visit to BurGR.  This time around was a lunch visit and I was starving so many plates were ordered amongst friends. One of which was the roasted jalapeno poppers. Delicious!!! This was also a fun eat as there are six poppers and out of the six, one still has seeds and no one knows which it is. Good luck choosing haha. The beer battered onion rings was delicious as well and came with a cheddar ranch that you cant help but continuously dip in.  When it comes to the burgers...The Farm burger was excellent and is what pushed my rating to the full five stars. Now, the other items helped but the farm burger is truly what did it. This was flavorful, juicy and I couldn't get enough of that egg yolk that ran down my burger after cutting straight down the center of the burger.   I left stuffed which sucked because I wanted to try a pudding milkshake. Nevertheless, I made my way back there for a second visit that same day LOL. This visit consisted of friends from my lunch visit and friends who didn't make it for lunch. I got my milkshake!!! Two great desserts combined in one...pudding and ice cream. I also tried some of the fish & crisp sandwich. I'm not the biggest fan of cod but this was delicious. Not too fishy at all and the batter was great.  I try to switch up my restaurant's every time I'm in Vegas but might have to make this a routine visit. Lot's of burgers to try and more desserts like the sticky toffee pudding pops. If the farm burger is any indication, the rest will be delicious.  Lunch and Dinner 12/12/2015"}
{"text":"A decent burger but it wouldn't even break into my top 5 local burger joints. We must have been lucky to have gone during an off time because after reading some of the reviews, I woulda been pissed if we waited in a long line.       Having said that the service there was top notch. They always came by to make sure we were good while taking the time to explain the menu to us. Additionally the \"poppers\" were pretty damn good. We even kept some of the sauce to put on our burger.       Our three burgers ranged from ok to good. Nothing bad, but also nothing worth waiting in line for. After two visits, the sticker shock from burgers and fries didn't go away after the first visit. Maybe it's just me but I must be in the minority on the truffle fries. They were basically steak fries with shredded Parmesan. Way to big and mushy with little truffle taste.        If Burgerz was owned by Joe Blow instead of mr Ramsay I'm not sure they would still be in business. Clearly the name is the draw here while many of the patrons will be one time, out of town visitors willing to wait/pay to eat a burger made by Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"Best gourmet burger in Vegas!! If u love cheese, then the Uber burger is right up your alley!! I also recommend the jalapeño poppers that come as a flight, like beer or shots in a shot glass filled with delicious queso!! I ate at Bobby Flay's burger palace earlier and this killed it!!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries are great. If you can not eat sugar or don't like sweets make sure to tell them not to put powdered sugar on them. Burgers are okay. They are cooked well but ours were too salty. Size slightly small for price. Bun just okay. The selection of burgers is good but honestly although the meat is cooked well again not worth the wait or calories. Milkshakes are cute made from pudding.   Besides the food being too salty and the buns soggy on the burgers, the waitstaff slow. Hostess makes everyone wait 30-40 minutes while there are plenty of empty tables inside. They text your phone when your table is ready which is nice, but then patrons wait again for 10-15 minutes to be seated. Our waiter was just okay never refilled drinks. Did explain to  us everything was cooked to order so food would take 20 minutes. Then the burgers came out cold.   Oh and the noise level was too high. Could not hear anyone talk. Music and TV's not necessary even if it is Vegas."}
{"text":"I only give four stars because the service was sub-par. We waited too long for everything. It took 10 minutes for us to even see our waiter once we were seated and the beers took 10 minutes after that! That being said, the food was perfect!!! I ordered the Damnation Chicken burger and was surprised with a juicy ground chicken burger. While it was not as spicy as I would have liked, the carrot celery slaw was perfectly crunchy and the blue cheese was rich and creamy. Definitely a winner. My boyfriend had the American burger and was blown away with the simple awesomeness. We chose to order the regular fries which come with curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup, both amazingly good. I put the chipotle ketchup on my burger as well. In retrospect, I would have definitely ordered the truffle Parmesan fries. An order went by us and looked amazing. I wasn't feeling dessert, but the milkshakes and other desserts that went by looked like they were straight out of the menu pictures. They also provide you with a tablet that has the drink menus and some of the cocktails looked very interesting. The beers were $6/$7 which was cheaper than any casino bar. Overall it was a great food experience, but the service was a letdown. Don't let that deter you, though. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We arrived here on a Saturday night, expecting to wait quite a while.  We put our name in for a table and we were told there was a 45 minute wait... no problem, we're in the casino, we can pass time there, AND they'll text you when your table is ready!  We were text paged our table was ready, and it had only been 20 minutes!  Fantastic!  There was about 8-10 choices on the menu for burgers, which was difficult to make a choice, since they all sounded soooo good.  We ordered sweet potato fries which are served with vanilla infused powdered sugar and we ordered truffle parmesan fries, also very delicious.    The service was outstanding!  We will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Gordan Ramsey fan so I fell for the gimmicky Hells Kitchen vibe. At least the theme was not Kitchen  Nightmares. Normally I would refuse to pay upwards of $15 dollars for a burger, but it was worth it!  The quality and variety of ingredients surpass any burger restaurant that I have tried. Duck bacon, Anaheim peppers, curry, and chipotle ketchup are some of the unique items here. In addition to excellent burgers the fries were top-notch. They reminded me of an enhanced version of Red Robin' fries. They are steak cut, nicely seasoned, and crisped perfectly. Unlike many touristy places in Vegas, this restaurant is more than a famous chef's name."}
{"text":"You need to wait to be seated but it's worth the wait ... The food is amazing !! Had the fury wings and the hella kitchen chicken burger ... It was amazing .. cooked to perfection and the serving size was just right ! The ambience is buzzing and has a good vibe which I think you would expect in Vegas ! Highly recommend you try the food ! If you go with a part of 3 or more I recommend you get the fries else you would end up taking it home as the portion is large! Overall highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice, but I honestly feel that Shake Shack burgers are more tasty than the two I tried at BurGR, and much cheaper."}
{"text":"Very loud, inside the casino. Be prepared for smoke to waft in from the casino. If you aren't used to eating when someone is smoking, stay away.  The food is eclectic. I have a burger that I thought was going to be spicy but was not. Burger was a bit dry, and the bun was dry, too.  The server seemed to disappear a lot. And the cost was outrageous. But then it was a Gordon Ramsay location, so what did I expect? A $14 burger and $13 fries. Won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been wanting to visit this restaurant for years.  We've both been a Gordon Ramsey fan for some time.    This place was AMAZING.  Service was great, food was outstanding and we're definitely going to go back again when we get to Vegas the next time."}
{"text":"It was ok, wasn't that great for something a world wide known chef designed, maybe because it isn't super high scale? But the truffle fries were really good! The Oreo shake was the bomb for sure though! I wouldn't go back again for sure though. Definitely a one and done."}
{"text":"I thought the food here was fabulous. From the check in to the dessert I had a positive experience and highly recommend this place.   Located inside the planet Hollywood casino I've always passed by this place but never tried it. I walked up and asked for the wait time which was 50 mins at around 8pm. The hostesses took my phone number and said they would text when the table was ready. Since we were next to the PH mall we did some shopping and gambling to pass the time. We got a text in 30 mins saying the table was almost ready. We took our time getting back to the hostess (10 extra min) and was seated right away. The waiter was very nice and most of the staff were really pretty people. He explained the menu and how to order and his recommendations.  We ordered a salad to start, I got the blue burger and shared some truffle fries. All of the food was amazing especially the French fries! Definitely try it and share it because it was so rich that we couldn't finish. I'll come back for the fries alone! Dessert was the toffee pudding pops which were ok. I also had a Boddingtons English bet which was fantastic. The ambiance, food and service was great and I believe I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"First Time visit, Long time Gordon Ramsay fan. The wait for two was 15 minutes on a Sunday night. We both had the American burger it was quite delicious. Fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection and quite huge! we started with the Maui onion rings(also delicious) and shared an order of garlic Parmesan fries. Service was fast and friendly. Unfortunately no room for the delicious sounding deserts but next time."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place for a good burger! The wait can be long but so worth the wait to eat here. It is also a bit pricey, it is worth every penny. I usually get the Euro burger, the truffle fries and of course you have to get one of their shakes. I have tried them all and I can't pick just one as my favorite! If you are leaving for nice dining and amazing food then try this place out. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The farm burger at Gordon Ramsay's Burgr was very good.The duck bacon added a special touch and the fried egg was cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and still had the skin on them. The chipotle ketchup was good and a little spicy.Didn't like the curry ketchup as much. It was a little too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Juicy burgers with sesame buns! It's delicious even as a to go cold burger, still tasty! You have to get the truffle fries with the aioli sauce! I never had thick truffle fries. I definitely say with thicker cut fries yoy can taste the truffle better. So delicious! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"The Hell Kitchen burger was OK but potato fries, truffle fries, and onion rings were not fresh and crispy at all.  I am so happy that I can get all these at better price and quality in Orange County California such as truffle fries from Unami Burger, potato fries from California Fish Grill, onion rings from Portillo's, and burger from Gburger.  My wife and I will not come back for sure even though we love Master Chef show !"}
{"text":"Great Burgers!  They are worth the $$$.  Loved the sweet potatoes fries.  Service was good."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers EVER!  We had an amazing dinner here while staying on the strip. The food was awesome, our waitress Ashley was the best! Started with the jalapeño poppers - yessss! Burgers were perfect in every way, and do not miss the Parmesan truffle fries. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Incredible burgers, well worth the wait. I've been here 3 times. I've tried 3 different burgers and they were all amazing. Servers go out of their way to make sure everything is perfect, indicative of well trained staff. YOU MUST GET A SHAKE. They do this pudding layer on top an traditional shake on bottom. The only complaint I have is their place mats. They always smell like dirty bar towels. 2 of the 3 times we had the server remove them from our table due to the funky scent."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  I got the Southern Yard Chicken Burger and it was Best in Class!!! Our table ordered the chicken wings as an app and I must admit that they too were the best I have ever had. Service was also great! When visiting Vegas on my next trip I will def be back here."}
{"text":"Been waiting 40 mins after ordering to get my burger... still waiting... and this is at 3:30pm. Not even during rush hour. When i sat down, the placement mat smelled like mildew... they had to take the mat away and wipe down the table again to get rid of the smell.  Dont get the truffle burger unless if you really like the taste of goat cheese. All you can really taste is the goat cheese and not the truffle."}
{"text":"Amazing food and worth the wait! We had the fun of playing \"the game\" with our waiter. He asked questions about our preferences and then custom ordered burgers for us. We had the jalapeño poppers for an app... Seriously yummy. My burger had 4 cheeses, mushrooms and avocado... The bun is even amazing. Often long lines to be seated... Come prepared with a cocktail.. :-)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I had the Britannia burger and sweet potato fries. The waitress was very helpful, making recommendations without being too pushy."}
{"text":"\"Another burger place to love inspired by yet another one of my favorite chefs!\" I recommend the Hells Kitchen Burger, \"Delicious!\" You have to try the truffle fries as well! This restaurant is perfect for when you want to that fancy meets casual feel with out having to dress up. :-)"}
{"text":"I was seriously craving a burger. 4 of us went in starving and ordered up.   If you have a party of 3 or more, here's what you do: 1 person waits in line that wraps alongside the hot ass window 1 person goes up to the hostess to tell them you have a party of X people 1 person goes to the bar to get line-waiting drinks  The stuffed jalapeños were delicious. So were the chicken wings. And the burgers. We were hungry ordering, so we also order 2 kinds fries - truffle and wet. We didn't finish either of the fries because we had so much food with the two appetizers and a burger each. Definitely ordered starving."}
{"text":"I thought the one featured item \"the burger\" was a bit dry. I'll prefix this with the fact that I like my burgers plain. Meat and bun which means the choice of meat, it's seasoning, the bun, how it's cooked are all that much more important. When I asked for for burger medium I found it to be overcooked (dry). I sent it back and got a burger that was undercooked. Neither had anything but average flavor. So why did I give the place four stars instead of 2 or 3. The truffle fries. They were steller."}
{"text":"Definitely not bad, though I'd say it doesn't place in the top 5 burgers I've ever had.  I have to admit, I stopped here pretty much because of the name. While I do love a good burger, Gordon Ramsay's shows are also some of my favorite guilty pleasure TV. I mean, who doesn't like watching someone break into tears as they're screamed at for burning risotto?  I opted for the Euro Burger and the truffle fries, as it sounded like they would make a good pairing. The presentation was quite nice and the food itself was a solid 3 stars. Pricing is what I'd expect for the location. In retrospect I wish I had gone with a different burger, as the Euro has such mild toppings that it really seemed a bit bland. To be fair, one of my co-workers went there the day before and had the Farm Burger, which he said was absolutely amazing.   I'm glad I checked it out, but I don't feel terribly compelled to return, especially considering how many restaurants there are to choose from in that area."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers ive ever had!! Im still trying to think of what other burgers ive had that were that good. I got the Blue Burger - medium, perfectly juicy and pink. It comes with Blue cheese and arugula. I asked to add the grilled jalapeno peppers in there (that i noticed the Hells kitchen burger had). So deeeelicious! Besides a good beef, the bun went just right (which really is half the battle!). The fries werent great, friendly staff and a modern, hip, gastropub ambiance. You must try it!"}
{"text":"Awesome, love this place. The food is great.  I loveeed the \"Hells Kitchen Burger\" and I got a cocktail and an appetizer of  jalapeño poppers that were delicious as well."}
{"text":"We love hamburgers so my wife and I were VERY excited to try Gordon Ramsay BurGr. We started off with the onion rings. HOLY YUMMERS the best onion rings of my life! They were beer battered and sprinkled with a cheese mixture that took them to another level of perfection. They were served with two dipping sauces, a chipotle sauce and cheddar ranch. I can't say which sauce I liked more because they were both delicious and entirely different from each other.  I had the Hell's kitchen burger- asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado & oven roasted tomatoes with a jalapeno pesto aioli. It was very good, I enjoyed it. My wife had the Euro Burger - truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, oven roasted tomato, she liked it. But In the end we both said the onion rings were our favorite thing. Totally outshined the burgers...."}
{"text":"I actually liked BurGR more than the Steakhouse, because of the price + service + quality of food. The patties are made in-house and are not frozen, so you can ask for it to be cooked rare or medium rare if you so desire. We got ours done medium rare, and the patties were all juicy and tender.  We ordered the Farm Burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger. The waiter will warn you, but the Farm Burger is SUPER FILLING. It comes with duck bacon, poached egg, and a burger patty.   It is salty, greasy, and has so much going on at once it is like a party in your mouth.  Jalapeno peppers were not in season, so the Hell's Kitchen burger was not spicy at all. Since the spiciness was the highlight of this burger, I found it a little bland. The Hell's Kitchen burger had patty and lots of avocados, but...no kick. The waiter even offered some sriracha sauce and tabasco sauce when I was ordering. I should've taken that as a hint that I should order something else. Nonetheless, the delicious patty was loaded with flavor and made it still very much enjoyable.  The waiters were very friendly, and came regularly to check up on us, refill our water, and made sure everything was good. He was quite nice, and chatted with us quite a bit, which definitely made the experience better.  We also got the truffle fries. We shared between 3 people, and there were still leftovers since we each ordered a burger. Definitely recommend sharing fries. it came with two sauces, a truffle aioli and ketchup. I am not sure if the ketchup is made in-house, but it tastes lighter than the regular store-bought stuff, and little less sweet and bit more acidic - a good way to complement the creamier aioli."}
{"text":"Do I really need to review this place? The wait wasn't as long as I thought it would be. Now I understand why he is the way that he is about his food. First of all that bite! Let's talk about that bite of the burger. Your teeth cut right through that beef."}
{"text":"This place is simply phenomenal! I LOVED this place. Best burgers and fries ever! The staff was absolutely wonderful!! Highly recommend anyone try this place at least once."}
{"text":"MMMBURGR!  MMMBURGR!  MMMBURGR!  MMMBURGR  Not just the best burger I've had in Vegas, the best I've had anywhere recently. Perfectly cooked, delicious sides (two kinds of flavored ketchup for fries), nice place to hang out. And Innis and Gunn beer on tap!! Here's a secret: You don't have to settle for the feta or goat cheese that is listed for most of the burgrs . . . just ask for what you want. Not inexpensive, but there aren't many (any?) inexpensive great restaurants in Vega like there were years ago.   MMMBURGR!  MMMBURGR!  MMMBURGR!  MMMBURGR"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, how do I not have a review for this place already? This is my favorite spot on the strip for burgers. The main reason that this spot up'ed Holsteins for me is that there's something special about the texture of their thick beef patties that almost has a melting effect once it hits your taste buds. I really don't know what it is and I would have never thought that it would make a difference but after coming here, both my boyfriend and I found ourselves looking for that texture and flavor in other burgers. Their brioche buns are amazing as well and also, all of their shakes have a pudding layer. So evil.  BurGR faves: Chanterelle Burger-  chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, fig-onion jam Farm Burger- DUCK BREAST BACON (yes it's that good that it needs the caps lol), English sharp cheddar & fried egg Euro Burger- truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, oven roasted tomatoes.  Truffle fries & Sweet potato fries- I know that every burger place has these on their menu but it's BurGR's sauces that set them above the rest for me   Shake #2: strawberry shake w/ coconut pudding + chocolate cookie. Heaven!   Another thing to add, everytime I've come here the service is amazing. All of waiters/waitresses give the same extensive treatment of talking about their entire menu, giving recommendations and having the best attitudes. They are all also very quick without seeming rushed. There are not many places that I've been to where all of the staff members are on the same level of great quality service. Awesome training on management's part. The only thing I would mention, these ladies and gents need a new uniform!!!! It is the TIGHTEST (not in a good way) most unflattering uniform I have seen! You can see every little dent and fold on them lmao I feel bad for them! Haha But anyways, other than that, this place gets an A+ in my book! Can't wait to go back! :)"}
{"text":"Best Burger joint in Las Vegas.  Great food a little pricey but you do get what you pay for with lots of yummy food. It's all good including the service."}
{"text":"So excited to come here with my bf. One of his top places to try in Las Vegas. It's a long wait and we came at 2:00 in the afternoon. Took about 45 minutes to get to our table and another 30 minutes to get our food. Restaurant inside the casino so it's a bit noisy.  Now the food.....it was worth the wait. The burger was so delicious I ate the whole thing. We go the Hell's Kitchen burger it was soft and flavourful. I asked for a side of ketchup which taste home made. My boyfriend got the Chilli dwag it was the biggest hotdog I've seen. Had a really nice kick to it. Not for the light eaters. We had the onion. Rings too which were okay; kind of hard to eat. The outer shell fell apart when you took a bite. Our total bill was $46 with tip. Definitely would recommend this place and if we were staying longer I would come back to try another burger."}
{"text":"The service was terrible in this place. Sure they were busy but wow it was really bad. The burger was ok and I would rate the place on the burger alone 3.5*. The fries were cold when they came to the table. Bad experience and won't be back."}
{"text":"In the words of Gordon Ramsay, \"Well, fcuk me... that was delicious!\" Everything was we had was delicious: Hell's Burger, Chanterelle Burger, Fury Wings, and Gooey Fries. Loved the Gooey Fries! I also had a cherry lemonade drink with whiskey... don't remember the exact name but sometimes, when I'm extra thirsty, I start thinking about it! I can guzzle a whole gallon of that cherry lemonade. With all the wonderful places to eat in Vegas, I'm probably going to head straight here from the airport!"}
{"text":"This was one of the most amazing burgers I've had in a long time.  Everything about my meal was great. The food was delicious and the service was very friendly and always made sure to come by to check up on how the meal was going.   I got to the restaurant just as it was opening, so seating wasn't a big deal. It was a nice environment -- not too loud and not too quiet.   Overall, food was amazing and service was great. What more could I ask for in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"$17 dollar burger, terrible service, and the sandwich absolutely was not outstanding.  I wouldn't say the burger was bad; it was, in fact, relatively good. Just not $14 good; especially for not coming with a side. The $17 above came from the fact that mushrooms on top were $3 without warning from the waitress. I was really looking forward to this sandwich, but the overall experience led to a bust. I've had burgers that were more enjoyable than this at a much lower cost. Having to be there for 2.5 hours due to slow service wasn't cool; neither was having to split our own check while ensuring that taxes were properly calculated. Having everyone's drink (water & soda) brought out one-by-one, with long intervals was also interesting... in a bad way."}
{"text":"Best truffle Parmesan fries ever!! I couldn't stop eating them! This place is located Inside Planet Hollywood and there was no line on a Tuesday afternoon. My burger had arugula in it which I love. My husband's burger had a fried egg inside and he says everything taste good with a fried egg. Sorry can't remember the names of the burgers.  Burgers were very tasty and fresh. Meat did not taste like it was sitting in the freezer.   Waitress was very attentive and service was awesome."}
{"text":"Excellent choice!!  Hell's Kitchen Burger and the American Burger are awesome!! Order the Truffle Parmesan Fries, don't miss it!!"}
{"text":"THE WAIT IS WORTH IT! There will probably be a waiting list if you visit Burgr in the evening. But they will send a text message to your phone when ready. And there's plenty to do while you're waiting. Play some slots in the casino. Have a cocktail at the Heart Bar in the center of the casino. Window shop at the Miracle Mile Shops. Or go outside and watch the human parade on the strip. Very entertaining. The time will fly by.  We all agreed that the appetizers, cocktails, burgers and chicken sandwich were some of the best we've ever had. Maybe the best. Seriously. The milkshakes looked awesome for desert but we were all too stuffed. We'll save that for next time.   The cocktail menu is on an iPad which they bring to your table. That seemed a little gimmicky and unnecessary. But that's my only criticism and a minor one at that."}
{"text":"Love Gordon Ramsay but I didn't think the food here was anything special, especially when you see the line and prices you're expecting something great.  The pork belly pao was the only good dish we had here and it was just good."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger - we love jalapeños and avocados! And pretty much try anything that has them. The burger wasn't bad, but I wouldn't say it was delicious either. A mediocre burger in a cute little restaurant. We also ordered the sweet potato fries which were actually very delicious! Almost like a dessert. It was nice to try, but I know it's not somewhere we would return."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and the wait was not very long, being a party of 2 (my daughter and I).  Looked at the menu on the wall while we waited.  They have a lot of good choices and we were able to narrow down our selection before we were seated.  I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger (rare) and my daughter Farm Burger (medium rare).  There were a few TVs around so we could watch the game.  We decided not to get any fries or onion rings because we saw the size of the burgers.  Seeing the size of the fries and onion rings - wow they were huge portions.  When our burgers came out they were pretty good sized.  They were cooked to perfection.  One of the few places that actually knows how to cook a burger rare or medium rare.  The burgers and toppings were amazing.  I would have to say this is one of the best burgers I have had and my daughter agrees.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mind blown!!!!!!!!! Finally great service in Vegas for us and the food is just amazing. Best burger you can have and the fries are just amazing! The idea creme Brûlée milkshake is just mind blowing!!!! I enacted to cry after I ate because it was so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time on Thursday June 5th for lunch around  2pm. Might have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the customer service. There is a great variety of burgers for everyone to chose from however our waitress killed the whole experience. She introduced herself and left her iPad on the table to look at drinks then walked away.  The table right next to us had a waiter who took the time to explain the menu and recommendations as well as helped them pick drinks from the iPad. Our food took about 15-20 min to arrive. It was perfectly cooked and the fries were perfect for sharing. When it was time to pay the waitress gave us a checkbook with an iphone built into it. Who knows what it was for since she didn't explain it and the iphone was just on the generic home page. We were paying cash and the waitress disappeared for 15 minutes so we had to waive down a waiter to take our money. Everyone around us sounded so nice and helpful we just got bad luck I guess. On our way out we ran into the waitress again who was talking with the hostess, she didn't even bother to say thank you or goodbye."}
{"text":"Amazingly delish!  Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, medium, with asadero cheese + roasted jalapeño peppers + avocado & oven roasted tomato.  Layers of FLAVOR!  Paired it with Truffle Parmesan Fries, hand cut style, must try!  For dessert, we had the coffee shake topped with creme brulee pudding. The prices were reasonable for the gourmet quality style and the service was friendly and fun.  If you like burgers, you will love these!!!  I would definitely recommend on your next visit to Planet Hollywood Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was good. Great service and reasonable prices for Vegas. Best thing I ordered my burger medium and it came out medium well. It was still great but when I mentioned it to the waitress she insisted on taking it back to show to the cook....hopefully a good Gordon moment. I got a new one and all kinds of apologies....I mean no restaurant I have been to has been able to cook a burger to order so doing it twice is a big deal.  It helped it tasted great both ways."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get, just paying for the name. Local burger bar in Detroit has burger twice as juicy and flavorful and its $9 not $18. Fries were good, shakes looked good as well but didn't try it. Too many other great choices in Vegas to eat here."}
{"text":"Overall: As a fan of the Masterchef series, I gave BurGR a decent shot when I came to Vegas. Honestly, they had subpar service and burger quality. For a decent burger, please head to the Burger Bar by Hubert Keller at Mandalay Bay.  Ambience/Service: This place has quite a long wait, even at ~10pm at night. The staff seated us at the bar because the tables were full. The bartender was attentive, but a tad rude. I think it took ONE HOUR for the food to arrive. It was quite a brutal wait time given that we just drove 6 hours to get the Vegas.  Food: I think their burgers and fries have a lot of room for improvement. Both burgers we ordered were dry and tasteless as the patties were under-seasoned. The fries were soggy. After this disappointing experience, I kept on searching for a decent burger in LV and found that Burger Bar has waaayyyyyyy better burgers. Save your money and head straight to Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"Loved the burger, truffle fries, poppers and push up for dessert. Very reasonably priced! High quality food for way better prices than other places. Best service around! The only thing that could have made it better would be a visit from Gordan"}
{"text":"Garlic Parmesean Truffle Oil Fries are AWESOME.  The aoli sauce was great but Gordon, you have to rethink putting the housemade ketchup on with those.  I am surprised!  It over powers the taste of the fries and is not complimentary at all.  Southern Acacia cocktail EXCELLENT!  Light and refreshing!  Hell's Kitchen Burger--Amazing! To die for!  Service was excellent.  Everyone had great knowledge of the menu, it preparation.  The IPAD experience is an awesome touch.  Shows you the cocktails, what is in them, their 30 beers on tap and wine plus other goodies like GR Gifts.    Now the bad--the fish was excellent but was served on a crispy bun which was doughy.  The vinegar and salt chips.......not chips I am used to but okay.  The bun was absolutely a fuck up!  Get on it Chef!    Overall Congratulations on a great success!"}
{"text":"Perfect.  Tried to think of anything, anything I didn't like: nothing...and I can be really particular.  Saturday, in gorgeous weather: 30 min wait quoted: 20 minutes after drinking and gaming at the video poker bar immediately next to the restaurant, I received a text letting me know the table was ready.  Hostess: nice. That's it, she was really nice-sounds corny, I know but table was ready, she got out of me that it was my bday (passed it to the wait staff...) and 3-4 other fun facts then seated 2 of us at one of those 2 peole tables in the middle of all those kind of places where you feel really uncomfortable, ugh. Wait, it isn't awful - weird. I think the oversized, comfy chairs made it a complete reversal of my expectations.  Ordered the truffle fries stat! I had heard enough, I want them, still want them.  The steak fries were very good but what makes it is the aiolo that is served with it.  I can't even describe how good that was, get some.  We ordered the Farm Burger (duck fat bacon, cheddar, fried egg-perfect ooze not run yolk: just yum) and ground chicken burger (pickles, cheese-okay and yes the ailoi I put on it...sorry Gordon (-,~) both burgers were fabulous!  Perfectly portioned, seasoned, designed. So good.  So despite being stuffed from all of that, I was able to further consume the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push-pops (say that 5x fast) because they were too good let melt.  Server was a total sweetheart as were the people here helping her with her tables.  It was a really good experience and I was even feeling queasy still from living it up the night before."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience here. We didn't have to wait for more than 20 minutes. We were lucky to have Alex as our server who gave us absolutely every bit of information we needed about food and drinks. He was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive. The food was amazing. Jalapeño poppers are the best I've ever had. Amazing onion rings and gooey fried. I had the hells kitchen burger and it was spectacular"}
{"text":"Shake #5, coffee shake with chocolate hazelnut pudding is just something else. But who knows, maybe my friends and I were in a delirious haze after 2 nights of Vegas and anything cold and caffeinated tasted good at that point ;) But honestly, I really liked the pudding that tops off the shake, which is what made it soooo good!   I also had the damnation chicken burger which had its pros and cons. Pros-- the chicken patty was seasoned and grilled perfectly! I've never really had a ground chicken patty that's moist and flavorful. Cons- the fiery mayo sauce was kind of nonexistent and the blue cheese was overpowering. I think they may have been a bit heavy handed with it...or I'm just more sensitive to blue cheese than I thought.   My friend got the same burger but with blue cheese on the side and she enjoyed it a lot more. Anyway, I can't really come to a burger place and complain about their chicken burgers :) Everyone in my group who got an ACTUAL burger (beef)  loved it. Hope to be back to try some of the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife and daughter, a few weeks ago visiting Las Vegas in order to attend a friends wedding.  The food was amazing, I ordered the Britannia Burger which was soooooo amazingly good. My wife ordered the Blue Burger and my daughter ordered the American Burger we were all very happy. We all shared an order of Onion Rings - they were out of this world!!!  I would have given my experience 5 stars unfortunately, the service was quite poor.  When we arrived we asked how long the wait was, they told me it would be 45 mins they took my name and number and told me I would be texted when we could sit down at our seat.  45 min later no text came when I asked how much longer the wait would be I was told it would be over an hour. And that my name had never registered in their system. I had to complain to 5 different people when they finally deemed it appropriate to let us sit at one of the several open tables."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this burger! Best one I've ever had and it's our family fave by far! Anyone that comes into town has to try it Gordon Ramsey knows his shit!"}
{"text":"I went there with my family while we were staying in Vegas and it was amazing! The service was great and the food tasted so good! Anyone who goes there has to try the new Shake #4 with oreos and creme bruelee."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend at Planet Hollywood, decided to give Burgr a try not only because of the great Yelp reviews that I read but also because im a huge Gordon Ramsay fan..  customer service was excellent, the line was long but the wait was short, for couples.. It was 30 minutes.. For a bigger party it could range from 30 minutes to two hours.  For an appetizer we had the jalapeño poppers... Omg.. I couldn't stop eating them.. So prefect. Most delicious burger I've ever had... The Britannia. It was juicy, perfectly cooked and the flavors of everything went so well together, my taste buds were in heaven.  my boyfriend had the Hell's Kitchen burger.. He thought it was bomb and full of flavor! I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD! BEST BUGER EVER!!!  Not kidding- that is what I tell everyone. And I probably drool a little in the process.  The wait in line was painful, especially not knowing about the food, but I like cooking shows and I wanted to try it, now I think about it all the time. And don't miss the vanilla powder on the sweet potato fries- yum!"}
{"text":"Why do restaurants like this make their staff wear extremely unflattering uniforms. It's supposed to make the place fit the brand, but when your staff isn't a bunch of manikins, it's distracting. Anyway, we were seated immediatly, but then service became very slow and odd. It took a while for the waitress to come by and when she did, she dropped off an ipad that contains drinks and dessert information only, but then didn't take any drink orders or offer water. It took forever for her to come back and another waiter checked on us and rushed our drinks out.   The menu is rather smallish, but they do right by burgers. Flavorful, juicy, just the right size. Quality ingredients and perfect prep make the difference. The duck bacon on the Farm Burger, unreal. I had the chanterelle burger, which was also good with arugula, chanterelles, and fig jam. I wanted the farm burger so bad, but had to watch the bf eat is as I avoid dairy. Sides are not included with your sammie so, be prepared for sticker shock. Sweet potato fries can act as dessert, but a milk shake ordered at our table can act as a meal. Dinner for 4 came to $75 with one cocktail, one soda, 3 burgers, a fry, and one just dessert.   Another A-ok meal in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon expecting there to be a huge line.  There was a line of around 20 people, but we were seated within 15 minutes.   This is located inside of Planet Hollywood.  Before coming here, i was pretty skeptical about another \"Burger\" place.  I mean, how much different can a burger be from each other? I was totally wrong.  I ordered the Gordon beef burger which had the Duck Breast Bacon and Avocado.   This was hands down the best burger I've ever had.  The truffle fries were also really good.    The one downside is that i heard the push pop was spectacular.  I'm not sure, but i think the push pop had alcohol inside.  I thought it was just ok, and i probably wouldn't get it again.    Overall, i think everyone should try this if they are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting and loved it get again! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was cooked perfectly. The jalapeño poppers are amazing! They are spicy but well worth it. We placed our name down and didn't get seated for and hour and a half. Expect at least this long of a wait. Once seated though, service was quick and attentive. The burgers are good, but definitely over priced simply for the hype. I've had a burger just as good other places back in Orange County. You definitely pay for the nice environment."}
{"text":"With all the hype surrounding this place, I came in with rather high expectations, and unfortunately they were not met.   The best thing we ordered was the jalapeno poppers appetizer. The presentation was great - six big poppers came in their own little glasses dipped in sauce; the taste was even better - cheesy, gooey, with the perfect amount of spicy kick. Annnnd then we had the burgers and fries, and the meal started declining.   I ordered the Hell's kitchen burger, and had some of the boyfriend's Farm burger and I have to say, they were nothing special. They're decently sized (ie not gigantic and make you feel uncomfortably stuffed afterwards), but there was not a single thing about them that made me throw up my arms and praise GR. But even then, I would've enjoyed the experience had it not been for the fries. Man the fries were not good. We had the handcut fries and the truffle fries, and though it was cool the sauces had such variety, the fries themselves were dry and the opposite of crunchy deliciousness that I expected. Maybe we had them on an off night, as most of the other Yelpers seem to praise the fries - but should \"off\" nights even exist in the GR universe?   The wait in line wasn't too bad, as it was just the two of us (you have to check in with the hostess without getting in line if you're a party of 3 or more), and the service was fantastic. But, the okay burgers and the less than okay fries made the experience bland."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here at lunch time on a Saturday.  The wait was about 10 minutes.  Both of us ordered burgers and shared the parmesan-truffle fries.  The burgers were very good and cooked to order (medium-rare and medium).  I had the Hell's Kitchen  burger and the roasted jalopenos added a real kick to the burger.  The fries were very good as well as the house ketchup for dipping.  The fries are large enough for two to share.  With a price of about $16 per burger and fries another $11, it was a bit expensive but then again so are most restaurants in Vegas.  The meal was a lot better than most of the more expensive meals we had.  The only downside was that the noise level inside the restaurant was deafening."}
{"text":"Last night I had stopped by once again to try something new. I had the best server ever, her name was Kelsey. Very friendly, great smile, great attitude, over all great. I had the sweet potatoes fries and the hog burger with a pepsi. Everything was good. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Ahi Tuna app off new menu was delicious! Not enough to eat as a meal though (comes w 2 bite sized). Burger was decent. Shrimp salad was really delicious, tart, and creamy. Crushed pepper mills would be a vast improvement for this gourmet-ish restaurant. Not a fan of curry ketchup personally."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Gordon Ramsey has really nailed it here. Every time I come to Vegas (and lately it's been fairly often) I need to stop by here.  Their burgers are spot on. Well constructed, great selection of flavors. They don't overdo it with the toppings. Even though there are several burger options to choose from, they change up the toppings just enough to give unique burger experiences, but still let the flavor of the beef shine. My favorites so far are the farm burger and the Brittania burger, you can't go wrong with either. Only downside is that the burgers are $15+. Whatever, worth it.  Where BurGR really shines though, is in the sides and shakes. Their truffle fries are the best fries I've ever had and their jalapeño poppers are out of this world. The Oreo milkshake is unlike anything I've ever seen before. Oreo milkshake, creme brûlée, whipped cream, and an Oreo cookie in top. Jesus take the wheel."}
{"text":"Lets see if gordons food equals his talk, well Ramsay delivers here.  The burgers were very juicy and tasty.  The venue itself is pretty casual most of the staff wearing weird Jetson's looking uniforms and all of them looked like they were fresh out of highschool.  The place is pretty noisy since it is located inside Planet Hollywood and there are no sound barrier walls, you can pretty much watch people walk by in the casino as you sit inside BurGR.  We tried the following:  Hells Kitchen Burger: avocado, cheese and some other items that just blended in.  The burger was moist, juicy and delicious however the toppings all sort of blended together. Britania Burger: sharp cheddar, mango salsa, arugula this burger was pretty good with the ingrediants playing well off of each other. The mango salsa is on the sweet side so dont order this if you dont have a sweet tooth. Maui parmesan onion rings: crispy, sweet onions with cheese-yumm.  These were some very well executed and delicious onion rings. Peanut Butter Shake: OMG the best thing at BurGR's are the shakes!  This one had alot of peanut butter in it and it was super yummy but very filling! Coffee Shake: this one had hazlenut pudding which I dont like, but my wife probably would have killed me if I had tried to take this from her LOL  Prices: burgers are about $14  shakes $11 onion rings $9  You also recieved $1 off all prices if you have a MGM Total Rewards Card.  NOTE: if you and your co-yelper are light eaters you can easily get by ordering one burger, one shake and one side.  The sides give large portions and the shakes are super filling."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! First of all-the service is incredible. I've been 4 times now and the service is outstanding each time. The staff is very friendly and extremely knowledgable. The managers are phenomenal as well and are consistent with their table touches and genuine concern for your meal and service.   I don't really eat meat, but they have great options for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike. I recommend the jalapeno poppers, soba noodle salad, and truffle fries!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone I know who has been there (and eats meat)  loves the Farm Burger!!  A great place for tourists AND locals!"}
{"text":"First of all, the wait time is horrible and they don't accept reservations. So that is the only negative.   The food is really good and offers a fun environment. I had the Hells Burger which was delicious and not over the top spicey. The truffle fries were fantastic and we all really enjoyed the jalapeño poppers. Not my favorite LV burger spot, but certainly one of the best."}
{"text":"I don't like burgers all like that but this place was good. Oh and their milkshake are just as yum :) we did not have to wait too long but they did let us walk around the casino while waiting. They texted us when our table is almost ready which is a super plus. Will definitely be coming back to try their other burgers."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Now that is a stunning burger! I got the three cheese burger and think it is by far the best burger ever. My foodie friend went for the spicy hotdog and was so happy with his choice too!   A bit expensive but I would definitely pay to play again anytime!  Yum yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I wanted to try this place and we decided to order different burgers and split them. I ordered the  Hell's Burger medium and it was excellent (spicy, savory, juicy). Had a nice kick which I always look for. Hubby ordered the Euro burger and it too was a excellent (the cheese was completely awesome, with arugula) Yum....  Service was great by Alex who made sure we had everything we needed without overwhelming us. Friendly and pleasant.   There is a wait, but everything worth having has one. Totally coming back."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 4 stars...but I just can't! The food and service are just THAT GOOD. We waited about 40 minutes for our food, but it was so worth it!  I at the Uber Cheeseburger and Truffle Fries. I couldn't eat it all because it's a lot of food, but I have dreamt of it ever since. The Cheeseburger was so moist and NOT greasy. The mixture of cheeses were unexpected and delicious. The bun was a sesame seed bun and tasted as though it had just come out of the oven. No need for ketchup or mustard or any other sub-par condiment on this burger - it's the cat's meow! The Truffle Fries nearly made me cry, they were so good. Steak cut fries with a delicious parmesan topping, along with homemade ketchup and some mystery garlic dipping sauce on the side. The mystery garlic dipping sauce  made me want to kiss the cook.   The atmosphere is a chic, dimly lit, diner with plenty of friendly staff who seem to love their job. It is located inside Planet Hollywood, so plan to park in the deck located in the back of the casino if you are not a guest - parking is only for guests. The restaurant is located in the midst of several slot machines, but the TV's act as somewhat of a barrier from all the noise. The front entrance displays a very cool fire feature. The menu is simple and to the point. Great burgers and sides. You can even take it home as a souvenir!  This isn't just some ordinary burger joint - Gordon Ramsay has outdone himself. The only sadness I have incurred is that this is the only location and I will have to wait until my next trip to Las Vegas for this experience again."}
{"text":"5 of us ate there Dec 9th for lunch. out of the 5 burgers, 4 were prepared incorrectly...extremely rare or very well done, it took a while to get waiter and he reordered 3 of them...2 came back the same way..mgr (female) finally came and took 1 burger off the bill. Would not go back..too many places to eat in Vegas..they were not customer friendly with correcting the food..it was NOT extremely busy..steady, but not w waiting line (and the girls who check you in...stop talking and attend to someone in front of you waiting to get in!  perhaps it's Gordon's name but not his people.."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a 3.5, could have been a 4 if the service was better. Waited in line around 10:45 on a Saturday morning and were prolly second or third group in line (group of 7). We were seated relatively slow for being one of the first ones in line. It took a few minutes for the waitress to come over, she took our drinks and then maybe didn't see her for a good 7-8 minutes. Took our order and it took around 35 minutes or so to get our food, and forgot one order of onion rings. I had the generic egg bacon cheeseburger and it was pretty good. I also enjoyed the egg ham fries, sweet potato fries, and truffle fries. All pretty good. Food good, service sub par. Could be a real winner with a little more attention."}
{"text":"Hubby has been craving a good burger and it took going to Vegas to finally find one. The milkshake was a very pleasant surprise as well. Definitely did not disappoint.  Just wish the table wait time was better and that we didn't have to travel so far!"}
{"text":"If your party is 3 or more eee tha host before getting in line we were seated immediately instead of waiting 30 minutes. Prices are high. Servixe was fast. Good drink selections. Wings pretty good. Hummus a-ok. Burgers good fries actually better than Expec"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers, I got the farm burger and it was wonderful. My friend also enjoyed his Hell's Kitchen burger and the truffle fries were great. Definitely would recommend going. The only criticism is for the artificial wait that they create. Despite have 3 hostesses and plenty of tables, they have you wait to get in just to create the appearance of being very busy."}
{"text":"There are hundreds of burger joints in Las Vegas by famous chefs, franchises, and local families, so standing out takes a lot of effort--and a lot of taste.  Gordon Ramsay's BURGR bar is one of those places that is on travelers' bucket lists for Vegas eats, as well as some locals.  I decided to give this place a chance given my love for Hell's Kitchen.    There is a long line to get in to the restaurant, one that any patron must endure if they did not make a reservation.  The line is 30-45 minutes long depending on what time it is.  The nice thing about standing in line is the amazing flaming sign that is stare-worthy for about 30 minutes.    The flames keep patrons warm while waiting in line, but on a summer day, this could be annoying.  Still, it is unique and is a great conversation piece.  It makes patrons wonder what is on the other side, and if the food is as intriguing and sexy as the front entrance.  After 30 minutes, we were finally seated in the main dining area right against the other side of this sign, and thankfully it was not hot to sit against.  The menu is simple and consists of appetizers, burgers, sides, and desserts/shakes.  We ordered the Brittania (mango chutney and sharp cheddar) and the Hell's Kitchen (jalapenos and gouda) burger.  To start, we went with the most unique option on the apps list--the banh mi pork belly app.    I did not expect to see this on the app menu at BURGR, but technically, it kind of is a burger if you consider burgers to be meat in between a bun. The pork belly was well seasoned, melts in the mouth, and the richness from the fat is cut by the pickled radish and carrots.  The bun, though, was lacking.  It had good flavor, but it was a bit dry and not as fluffy as it should be.  Still, the taste was there and it was a nice way to start the meal.  When the sides and burgers arrived, we were quite excited.  They were 4\" in diameter and served in a bun that held up to the juicy patty.    The britannia has caramelized onions, a mango chutney, and a sharp cheddar with arugula.  The toppings were amazing and the patty was seasoned well.  The buns held up to the patty, having that bounce back to it.  The Hell's Kitchen burger is spicy and juicy, salty and a bit sweet.  I cannot say the burgers were terrible, because everything tasted great, but neither are burgers that I dreamt of the next day.  Gordon Ramsay has his reputation for a good reason and his food is very good, but I wasn't too impressed.  The patty was great and cooked to a perfect medium, which I loved.  Overall, a nice burger but the toppings made it yummy, not the meat, which should be the main event.  The fries were served with a curry ketchup and a spicy one, which both were good.  I love steak fries and could eat these all day.  The fries are crispy on the edges and baked potato soft on the inside.  I love how perfectly fried they were and how large each fry was.  The winner of this visit, however, was Gordon Ramsay's sticky toffee bread pudding--push pop style.  They layer the pudding with the ice cream and it is sticky, sweet, and creamy.  I could eat four of these for dessert despite the richness of each pop.  I love the whimsy of the push pops.  Ending the meal with a fun dessert made the entire experience a positive one.  Service was just as lovely as the food.  Our server was outstanding, friendly, and helpful in every way.  From watching Gordon Ramsay on television, I expected excellent service, and this restaurant delivers.  From wine lists to dessert, our server cleared our table all the time and made sure we had everything the way we wanted it.  Overall, BURGR was a nice experience but a place that will be the first to come into mind when I'm craving a gourmet burger.  Although the food was good, it wasn't memorable in any way, except for dessert.  Maybe I am picky or one that cannot be satisfied easily, but BURGR will not be on my \"regular eats\" list.  Still, it is worth a try and gave me the right to say that I've eaten at a Ramsay restaurant that was on television.  In the end, I think that's what BURGR is all about--bragging rights."}
{"text":"This place is my newest addiction! I can't wait to go to Vegas to come back here!! The service was great and the food was amazing!!! Burgers are cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I was soooooo excited to go here .... had the foie gras burger and fries .... sooooo disappointed in the mediocrity. The restaurant was so busy 2hr wait and I decided to get take out to avoid the madness, the bartenders were rude in regards to giving direction due to the fact to go orders were done with the host and not the bar..... not a fan"}
{"text":"Wait wasn't too bad about party of four about 20 minutes. Very busy restaurant however, the wait staff was vey nice and helpful, extremely upbeat and not at all overwhelmed!! Only reason I didn't give five stars is because my table was uneven and my drink spilled!!"}
{"text":"Firstly, Gordon Ramsay knows how to design a restaurant! We were here this weekend and left really impressed and very full of delicious nom noms  They don't take reservations so we had a wait time for seating, but 20 minutes is not bad at all on a memorial day weekend Saturday at noon. Instead of giving us one of those annoying buzzers that only work within a certain radius, they took a cell number and texted us when our table was ready allowing us to wander throughout the casino in Planet Hollywood while we waited.   The atmosphere is really neat, especially for a lunch place. The theme definitely goes along with the Planet Hollywood idea. The funky silverware was my favorite! Technology was also used very well in this restaurant. Our server greeted us promptly and provided an IPAD for us to check out drinks and desserts (with pictures and ingredients).   The server was not only awesome but very knowledgeable about the menu. He had personally tasted everything on the menu and was happy to give his feedback about any item. He was also great about checking on what was gluten free for me. The service in general here was top notch. Our waters were never empty, the manager stopped by each table to see how the meal was going, and our meal was brought out by an entourage of servers at the same time and they all made sure we had everything we needed before leaving. At the end of the meal you even fill out a easy survey on the electronic device provided with your check to ensure the service was excellent.   Now to the important stuff, the food! The burgers were awesome. I had the chanterelle burger with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun and it was delicious! The meat was a perfect temperature and the fig compote and chanterelles were a really nice touch. My boyfriend and the Euro burger which was great. We also enjoyed some of the amazing parmesan truffle fries and him and our friends enjoyed the onion rings (not gluten free). I'd have loved to have tried the puddings but they unfortunately had gluten in them. The mixed drink I had (skinny screw) was done really well. Not too sweet or too overbearing with alcohol, plus it was garnished with a fresh mint sprig and orange slice which I devoured at the end...a faux pas?? Maybe, but they were fresh and delish!  Wait time for the noms was less than I expected with how busy it was and price (55 with tip for two meals and a alcoholic drink in Las Vegas) was reasonable.   Its a good thing Burgr is not close by, my waistline might be in trouble if I had those truffle fries readily available.."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time eating at BurGr and was the best experience yet. The food was great, but the service was exceptional. It's a pleasure eating at a restaurant that obviously trains their staff well. Our server Ashley was knowledgable, with a great personality and she gave us outstanding service. Even the food runners were great, describing each dish as they served it."}
{"text":"I went not really expecting much from this place. That should say something when I say that it was terrible.  I was with some friends and I split the Blue Burger and the Fish Sandwich. The blue; Besides the burger being overly dense and way too dry, (even though it was pink) where on earth did you find the blandest blue cheese I have ever tasted. Next time I'll go to Carl's Jr for the same quality and maybe a little juicier. The fish sandwich; Let start with it was Friday which is suppose to be the best time to   order fish right!? It was neither fresh nor fresh frozen it was yesterdays fish or it was left out too long that day. I had one bit and spit it out. The rest of my friends thought this was funny (5 of them) so I dare all of them to eat a bit. No one could swallow it.  I did not make a stink because I was drinking and so was everybody else so I thought it better not to make a scene. But I will never recommend this place to anyone ever, and you would have to pay me to eat there again.  To the server that did not get a tip. I know it wasn't your fault but it is better than me yelling at you.   Thank you Gordon Ramsey for confirming my belief that a celebrity restaurant is never a good idea."}
{"text":"There are no words for how unbelievable this place was. The service was AMAZING and and in addition to that, the food was all that I was hoping for and then some!!!  The burger was perfectly cooked to order-I ordered medium and actually got my burger, or should I say BurGR, medium! I got the farm burger and the server described the duck bacon exactly how it tasted and the egg was perfectly over easy.   The fries, which all five of us ordered our own order of fries, were super delicious!  When we ordered drinks, the server let me taste the various beers and wines that I was interested before finally settling on my final drink.   The wait was absolutely worth it and EVERYONE who goes to Vegas and likes burgers should stop by!  Thanks Gordon Ramsy for his materpiece!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and I love this place !! If you love burgers and are in Vegas, you have to try this place. Great decor, awesome beer selection, creative burger creations and superb service !! Must try: Truffle Fries, Pork Belly Bao, Farm burger and Hell's Kitchen burger."}
{"text":"Was there today with my girfriend. Agree with comments about the skimpy outfits. Really if Ramsey wanted this place to look like hoot ers, he should have made also sure that all girls LOOK like girls from Hooters. Service was excellent, I was served 7 refills on my diet pepsi(hangover dehydration you see) instantly and generally had no complaints from the service. As to the food now. We took onion rings(yummy, cripsy) with parmesan cheese and 2 sauces. Hellfire burger was good although a bit too spicty for my tastes-but I knew what I was ordering. My girlfriend's Europe Burger unfortunately wasn't as good, as it was burned on the outside. Both burgers were ordered and served at the same time, both ordered medium, so I don't know how this happened.  A dissapointment was the fact that the burgers came with NO sides at all. I know they are trying to make money off sides, but really, 15-17$ for a not-so-big burger with NO sides? Generally I can't say I was dissapointed, but I wasn't impressed either, hence the 3 star rating. I iwll keep going to my favourite Gnad Lux Cafe for food when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"The food and wait staff was AMAZING!!  We only had to wait for maybe 20 minutes before we were seated. I had the euro burger and it was so freakin amazingly good. It was definitely a $15 burger. We also had sweet potato fries. I didn't like them because they sprinkled powdered sugar on them but my fiancé did. I would totally go back to try other burgers and sides."}
{"text":"This place decent but I would recommend Burger Bar or Holsteins over this place if you are in Vegas looking for a burger.  I got the farm burger which is a beef patty with a fried egg and bacon.  My problem with the burger was that I felt it was something I could have easily made myself.   The difference between a real chef and me is that a real chef should be able to tie all the different ingredients together and create something where the sum is greater than the individual parts.   I didn't get that impression from this burger  My wife ordered the pork belly bao bun which was decent,  it would have been a lot better if the bun itself wasn't extremely mediocre.    The sweet potato fries were quite good,  they come with a shaker of vanilla powder and a honey jalapeno mayo.  The mayo had just a hint of jalapeno flavor and zero heat from the pepper.     Overall, I would go back again if someone wanted to eat there but if it was up to me I would suggest a different burger place"}
{"text":"My taste buds were not impressed.  I had the farm burger and and regular fries with a raspberry tea The tea was good, the burger was OK and the fries were bland. Even the ketchup was a little off.  Overall I expected much more from a Gordan Ramsay restaurant. With so many burger places- I would not return here."}
{"text":"Fantastic fries ..., but the Farm Burger was flavorless & dry. It should be renamed the Farm BoreGR. The famous Farm was totally not worth our 30-minute wait in line.  Luckily, a Hell's Kitchen Burger was much better ... thanks to add-ons of Duck Breast Bacon and a Fried Egg (both of which are on the Farm BoreGR) which complimented the Hell's Kitchen Jalapeño, Tomato, and Avocado.  Truffle Parmesan Fries (Lunch $10)  ... featured large Potato Cuts that were exhilarating without the normal oiliness of French Fries. The flavor blend of Truffle Parmesan, Truffle Salt, and Truffle Aioli was Truffletastic. Of course, at $10 you'd hope these were better than your normal burger joint fries ... and they were. (4 stars)   Hell's Kitchen Burger (Lunch $13)  ... is one of the popular burger choices with Asadero Cheese, Roasted Jalapeno Peppers, Avocado, and Roasted Tomatoes. It would of been 3 stars except we added, for a few $ extra, Bacon and a Fried Egg. (4 stars with add-ons)  Farm Burger (Lunch $14)  ... was probably the most hyped burger on Yelp; however, despite the goodness of Bacon and ooze of a Fried Egg, this was a dry blah disappointment. Olivia wanted to return it, so, I gave her half of my HK Burger. If you get the Farm BoreGR add Avocado and Jalapeno Peppers to add any flavor. (2 stars)  Batch 19 Beer ($7) ... Bold and hoppy like Gordon Ramsay himself, this Coors-brewed Pre-Prohibition Style Lager helped take the edge off. If I go back to Gordon Ramsay ... and there is no line ... then I might just plop down in front of one of the TVs and relax with an order of the Fries and this brew.  With a slow wait and overpriced BoreGRs, the cool factor for Gordon Ramsay BurGR isn't enough to elevate this burger joint among the elite food destinations in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here for my sister's birthday. It was fun and nice however a few things irked me. We had to wait in a line which took forever. Gordon Ramsay places usually will call your name, not make you wait in line like some buffet. I have been to several of his restaurants and they never do this to you. The prices are alright, I had the cheeseburger and it was not the best burger I have ever had as I was expecting. We also got the fries which were delicious! I love the seasoned ketchup, it was great! The ambiance was cool too but the servers around there were not so helpful. If we needed anything we had to wait a long time. Our server never seemed to care about us either. She was great when we flagged her down for a refill but otherwise it was a lost cause.  I love Gordon Ramsay and his restaurants. Sadly I would only return here if we did not have to wait in the long like like cattle.The burger and fries were yummy and I would like to come back to try their toffee shake or the pops."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious burgers! Great ambiance and service. Just an f.y.i you must arrive early as it is always packed. I only gave it 4 stars because I think it is silly to only offer burhers ger ala carte and charge for the sides separately liker their delicious fries. They are pricey so be prepared."}
{"text":"What makes me a fan of Chef Ramsay is that we both share the same standard when it comes to preparing food, and running a successful food business.  That being said, this was my first experience at one of his restaurants.   I have to be honest and say that my expectations of BurGR were not high since it is a burger joint and not one of his flagship restaurants. I was nonetheless still excited to try it.   We (my wife, mom) arrived about 8PM on a Wed night. There was about 25 people in line so the wait to be seated took about 25 min.   Once seated, we were promptly greeted by our server. ( I only use names when the service credits the individual, I don't bash ) She was very knowledgeable about showing us the touchscreen, and her steps of service would satisfy management in knowing that she knows how to suggestively sell beverages and appetizers.   Since we have never been her before, we took some time to take in the menu.   While I was checking out the menu, I could not help but to be distracted by this awful smell coming from the table. I was trying to dismiss it, but it was strong enough to make me realize that if I did not get rid of it, it would ruin my \"first experience at a Ramsay restaurant\"   My wife saw me smell the table several times, and confirmed that I was not crazy. She and my mom could smell it too.   I'm a foodie, so getting rid of this smell was a no compromise thing.  Ya feel me??  I've been working in \"the biz\" for 18 years. I knew this smell. It was the sour smell of bacteria. At first I thought that it came from the towel that was used to wipe the table and that it could be fixed by just asking that the table be wiped down with a clean towel.   No biggie right?  I had to use the restroom so my wife asked our server if she could take care of this. Her response was \"oh, ok\"   I came back from the restroom and sat down. My wife informed me that nothing was done yet. Ok I thought, not a problem. (yet...)  Our server returned with 3 waters and proceeded to suggestively sell beverages and appetizers. I ordered a Guinness and the jalapeno poppers.   She was the type of server that speeds off the table before confirming with all the guests that everyone is finished ordering so I stopped her and asked if we could have the table wiped down again. Her response was again \"oh, ok\" As I hastily explained to her about the smell, I discovered where it was coming from when I picked up the VINYL PLACE MAT  that was in from of me.    (Here it is, the answer! The table gets washed but not dried, the place mat goes back on the table and stays wet. Bacteria forms on the bottom of the mat and that nasty sour smell is created over a period of time. Even though the busser wiped down the bottom of the mats, a hint of the smell still remained. It would have to go through the dishwasher, but I don't think it would have survived. Still, I did not let my silverware touch it)  My wife is the sweetest woman you could ever meet. Every person that meets her will confirm this. It is usually me that says things the wrong way on occasion.  When the request to wipe the table came a second time, our server  responded with a look that I did not see, but pushed my wife off that very long ledge.   I let her handle it because if were me I would have not been as tactful.   Long story short, we got the table fixed (well, sort of) and my diplomatic wife decided to keep our server. It was one of those things that puts a beacon on your table that keeps you from complaining about anything else that could go wrong so you don't look like vindictive people.   If it's one thing I can't stand is vindictive people. Especially in the food and beverage industry.   We placed our burger order and waited for the culinary magic to begin.   The poppers arrived. 6 roasted (or fried?) breaded, stuffed jalapenos dipped in individual shot glasses half filled with cheddar ranch. My first bite led me to believe that they were still cold in the middle until I took my second bite which was warmer. The ranch cooled off the dipped part of the popper so don't wait to eat them or they will be cold. The flavor (hot or cold) was phenomenal!!!! loved it and they were very spicy. I would return just for these.   The BurGR's we ordered were the Farm, American, and Hell's Kitchen with a side order of Parmesan Truffle fries.  Beautiful looking burgers! A picture on every plate. The fries, not so much. Seems they take \"just fries\" and add Parmesan on the top and you get your truffles on the side. The truffle aioli  was delicious, but the fries sat a little too long under the heat lamp.  The burgers were executed perfectly. I thought the meat was under seasoned if at all. The brioche bun was ever so soft, the toppings flavorful.    The Shakes are to die for. My wife said it was the HERO of the day.   BurGR is an experience worth trying if at least once.   Ditch the placemats though, just to be on the safe sanitary side."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled! Gordon Ramsay has never been to this shitty place and never will!!  The place was half empty but the hostesses made us line up like cattle before they would let us in, WTF! Next, the fine print, your $15 feedlot burger (not even grass fed) and friends $15 chicken burger does not included fries double WTF??!! After placing the order, food came after 30 minutes and they messed it up by not putting the strong bbq mustard sauce on the side, so I sent it back. Beside the point, both burgers were average, not the 5 star quality I would expect from a maestro chef like Ramsay. Did I mention the $8 fries were not even fries they were thick wedges which I hate! Not even close to In n Out or Chick Fil A, which is where I'm going for my next sandwich!"}
{"text":"I initially scoffed at the idea of a  \"gourmet burger\" but I was wrong to do so. The food here is excellent and well worth the money. The whole menu is fantastic: burgers, fries, shakes, appetizers... I recommend all of it. The women who work there wear form-fitting outfits, which is a nice touch. My wife isn't generally a big fan of burgers, but she loves this place.  It's not perfect, however. The big fire display at the front of the restaurant looks nice, but gives off too much heat. Service can be slow if the place is busy.  One time we showed up on a Superbowl Sunday, but did not realize until after we had been seated that they were having a party that required everyone to pay a huge sum of money to attend. There was no sign anywhere relaying this information. We had to hear about it from our waiter. We ended up paying for the appetizer we had ordered and left. It was an awkward situation.  Anyone looking for the best burgers in Las Vegas should give this restaurant a try. It's fantastic."}
{"text":"Over rated and way too much hyp! The service was not good and food was mediocre at best. Watch out for the 18% gratuity for groups of 6 or more. I don't mind paying it but it's confusing on your check! I guess we set our expectations too high and we were let down!"}
{"text":"First off the garlic truffle Parmesan fries were to die for! The actual burgers were so so, had to wait for a table at lunch on a weekday, and service was ok.  I felt the prices were fair and I enjoyed the decor."}
{"text":"We also eat here whenever we visit Las Vegas. The food is always the bomb! Especially their truffle fries. The service is excellent and fast. They are nice. We also try to go around lunch time because usually around afternoon it is very packed and there is a long line. But we got there around 12ish, they gave us a table right away."}
{"text":"This is the second time that we have eaten there. We have tried the Farm Burger and the Hell's Burger. The truffle fries were to die for! Christina Wilson, a winner from Hell's Kitchen, even took the time to take a picture with our kids. They were beyon thrilled! Many kiddos!!!"}
{"text":"There isn't much to say. There are better burger places.   Thought the burger itself was a bit dry and with no sauces in the buns, it made it very chewy.   We ordered the Parmesan fries.  Good. If I were to rate the restaurant on the fries, it would get 4 stars.   Also had the number 4 shake. Absolutely delicious until you get too much of the Creme Brûlée. Makes it a little to sweet. Only a small bit of the Creme Brûlée would make is even the better. It was the best Oreo shake I had ever had.  A bit on the pricey side as well. 2 burgers, fries and a shake was $58.   Would not go back."}
{"text":"We were in town for 5 days. Actually passed this place twice, before going in today. The wait was about 10 min. I took a look around to see how the food was as it passed by.  So we ordered a chicken burGR, sweet potato fries and a great chocolate truffle shake. The sandwich was delicious, and there were too many fries to eat. This was the best $9 shake I ever had. Reminded me of John Travolta in Pulp Fiction when he order a $7 shake. \"it's the best damn $7 shake I had\"  I recommend this restaurant to people visiting LV, Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Yes yes yes!!!  Burgers are delicious, as are the onion rings and truffle fries. Great dipping sauces too.   They have a mushroom burger for vegetarians (I tried my friends, wasn't a fan) but I really don't understand the vegetarian thing.   Would recommend over and over."}
{"text":"Best BurGrs in town. It's a must go when in Vegas. The place is very hip and the entrance has a cool fire display that most people take pictures of.  The food is amazing, the sweet potatoe fries and the truffle fries are the best you'll ever have. The prices are very average and way worth it.  A must, must go if you've never been."}
{"text":"Their hamburgers are delicious. Their jalapeño poppers are to die for. So delicious and presented very well! I would recommend trying this place if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay has many successful restaurants and I did not expect less from BurGR located in the Planet Hollywood hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly. All service received was very courteous but I honestly expected a lot more from the food since the server told us that they were rated for the best burger in Vegas. As I opened their menu, my eyes landed right on one of their newer burgers, the Truffle Burger. The truffle flavor was rich but the patty itself lacked some flavor. I downed my burger in a lot of truffle aioli and some ketchup to finish it. I was not impressed by the truffle parmesan fries either, it came with truffle aioli and ketchup but it needed some extra salt or flavor. Overall, I enjoyed my experience and was not impressed by the food."}
{"text":"They have a great mix of burger choices. The size looked a little small at first, but really was perfect. We had the Hells Kitchen burger which came dropped with roasted jalapeños, guacamole, and cheese. The meat was cooked medium and was really juicy on a black and white sesame.  I recommend the onion rings. The portion is perfect for two and were fried to perfection.  The one thing we had which we did not like at all was the Pork Belly Sliders. The pork belly was cooked fine, but it had a flavor profile that I did not like. This was on an Asian bun and paired with traditional pickled vegetables that to me seemed a little over bearing and harsh.  Would defiantly go again."}
{"text":"I've visited during my last two trips to Vegas.  - On July 3 2013 the experience was so-so but I attributed the stomachache to the fact that I had been drinking at the pool that day.  - On December 19 2013 I went back, because I did remember the bartenders and bar scene being quite fun. This time around I got a stomachache again and it is definitely the poor food!  Problems:  - The American Burger is served with PROCESSED CHEESE like from a Kraft package! Disgusting!  - The Jalapeno Poppers are served with a sauce that was so heavy, it was really a downer.  - The plates are scratched and in poor condition. Like a Denny's from the MidWest.   If Gordon Ramsey were to eat here and the logos were changed, he'd SLAM this place and send it straight to the depths of hell's kitchen."}
{"text":"Saturday night waiting in line was moving at a good pace. Looking for a FINE burger? This is the place to enjoy light, fine ingredients, non-sloppy DELICIOUS  burger...and REASONABLY priced! I ordered chanterelle burger ( for the love of mushrooms) and there's more exciting burgers on the menu and my order was equally delicious! I have passion for anything bread and this bread was AMAZING! it's almost like pretzel bread subtly firm on top and soft inside. I ordered my patty medium rare and they gave me a perfect medium rare! Check out my photos on this. When you take a bite, you can taste everything that's in it, very clean and did not need anything else, every ingredient complimented each other, the arugula greens (my favorite) was the perfect addition to the mushrooms. How can you not order the Parmesan dusted fries with their homemade ketchup and truffle dip! It's a must!  My friend ordered the Gordon Ramsey burger that's not on the menu and suggested by our server.  I'm not going to mention what's in it but accdg.  to my friend, this was delish!!!  Jarred, our server was attentive, friendly, and loved the fact that he mentioned and made suggestions what's on the menu and not on the menu. My friend and I are adventurous foodies. 'Will try anything!  While my friend was finishing up her wine, plates removed off our table, we did not feel rushed despite the fact that it was a full pack restaurant. A fine burger restaurant  to try out while in Vegas!  Not a hype, by the way!"}
{"text":"I will always make time to visit this restaurant while in Vegas. Best burgers, apps, and milkshakes I've ever had. I didn't realize how good a burgr could be until I had these!"}
{"text":"Literally the best burger I've had in Vegas. Patty was juicy and flavorful. You can add an extra patty on any burger for $7. Pricey, but well worth it. Honestly, $16 burgers are not too bad comparing to other burger places on the strip. Also had the vanilla powdered sugar sweet potato fries, which was awesome. Dessert came via sticky toffee pudding popsicles. Can be skipped, but wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"The American burger was pretty good and the fries were done right. My gripe is that the wait for something this simple shouldn't have taken an hour. We went in for lunch, on a Monday around 11:30 am. 4 burgers and 2 orders of fries should in no way take that long to get on your table. I'd give the food a low A grade and the wait time an F. So overall, it was good but maybe not worth the effort."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, yummy drinks, and killer dessert milkshakes.  Definitely worth trying but you may have to line up for a table."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by this burger. With a name like \"Burger\" and with Gordon Ramsey's influence behind it, I was expecting a really flavorful burger. Instead, I got meat that relied on extra sauces to bring out the flavor.  Having had multiple burgers from great places in Vegas - Burger Bar, Shake Shack, and even Holstein's during the same trip - Gordon Ramsay's BurGR didn't do the patty justice.  The turkey burger sounded quite good with manchego cheese, blueberry compote, candies lemon, potato crisps, butter lettuce, and spicy mayo which I got on the side. After a bite, I realized that I either needed more of the blueberry compote or I needed some other sauce like the mayo to add some flavor. The burger was moist but poorly seasoned. It came alone, without fries or onion rings.  I also got the #4 shake with creme brûlée pudding, Oreo shake, and Oreo cookie. Again, I was underwhelmed. The concept of putting pudding on top of a shake sounded strange and it tasted even worse. I couldn't finish it.  I spent $24 for a mediocre meal but at least the service was good."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. I have been here twice to eat dinner with few friends and the flavors are honestly whatever. I would much rather have In & Out over this place.  Burgers I have tried: Hell's Kitchen Burger - little bit of kick to it but nothing to write home about  American Burger - just a standard burger that costs $13 dollars. I could have grilled something like this in my backyard.  Sides: Truffle Parmesan Fries - these are below average truffle fries. I've had good truffle fries and these have a very very light truffle flavoring. Not Good. The dipping sauce is good.  Just Fries - these are standard french fries. Can't go wrong with this.  There are much better Burger places in L.A. that are half the cost then this place. Holstein's at Cosmo is much better."}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to coming here for quite a while. The wait was not too long at around noon on a Saturday. Asked to be seated at the counter facing the kitchen which was a pretty cool seat. The burger was pretty good. I got the European burger. Also got a shake and it taste like someone took a bottle of caramel and put a straw in it. Way way way to much to think about drinking. Maybe that's why they give you a straw like boba.   I would go back if the wait wasn't too long but the burger was good minus the wow factor. Maybe my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"What an amazing burger place and not too bad of prices either to eat at a Gordan restaurant. My husband and I shared the Euro burger and Truffle fries. Delicious. The burger came with a roasted tomato and goat cheese on it. Perfection! The truffle oil and Parmesan were not just sprinkled on top of the fries, but throughout which made them superb. The staff was friendly and on point. Make sure to save room for dessert because the shakes are sinful. All are topped with pudding and a cookie, which sounds a bit different but it works. We got the chocolate shake topped with caramel pudding and a toffee cookie. The best chocolate shake I've ever gotten. Just the right amount of cocoa and sweetness."}
{"text":"Been here twice and they never disappoint!   The chicken burgers and jalapeno poppers are so delicious.  I would come back again and again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"ok the service sucked you have to wait 45 min but the truffle fries are amazing. got the chantelle burger and hells kitchen burger. the burger can seriously last you 2 meals. super awesome place id come back... just gate waiting 45 min in line"}
{"text":"I'm such a Gordan Ramsay tv fan, this was on my checklist of places to eat!   LOCATION: The first restaurant to the left when you enter Planet Hollywood from the Strip, you won't miss it because it has real flames encased in glass but it's not hot.    LINE/WAIT: My friends flew in Friday night so we got here around 11:15pm? We checked in at the counter, gave them my cell phone so they could text me when the table was ready. We took some pictures in front of the flames and the total wait was maybe 10-15 mins. I love this text waitlist so if it was any longer we could just wander about.   FOOD: My bf and I had eaten at a buffet earlier in the day so we just split the Hell's Kitchen Burger. They were nice and actually split it in half for us and brought an extra plate. I liked it, it was just the right amount of spicy but it wasn't the best burger of my life, which sadly I was expecting. We also ordered regular fries and my friends got the truffle fries.  Both fries were meh. They were both super hot (temp) but still kinda hard and airy at the same time. The truffle fries and regular fries all came with different dipping sauces. None of them blew my mind.    I was also excited to try the shake since they looked so good on yelp!  We split the #1 (caramel pudding + chocolate shake+ toffee cookie). The menu says \"shake'\" but it LITERALLY is pudding. When I think shake, I just assume ice cream shake and so this was SO not what I was expecting. It was like eating a jello-pudding cup of thick chocolate PUDDING with a layer of caramel on the top 1/3 of it.  :(   OVERVIEW: Certain expectations are sometimes the worse because this happens where I wasn't blown away and I don't agree with most of the yelpers. The burger was good but I wouldn't come back here. Glad I got a check off my food list though!   TIPS and stuff: *Make sure you give your TR card before they bring you the check. I forgot but the waitress was nice enough to re-run it.    *Here's a link to the full menu: http://www.planethollywoodresort.com/content/dam/phv/Dining/Casual/burgr/GRBurgerMenu_9_15_2013.pdf  *Also... I didn't know this until we sat down.. BurGR.= BurGordanRamsay. Haha"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to eat here without making any reservations and anticipated the long wait but it wasn't bad after all.  The hostess stood by the line, right next to the flaming design entrance to the restaurant.  I approached her and requested a table for two.  She said it would be a 45-minute wait, then she asked for my phone number and name, so when our table was almost ready they would text me.  About twenty-five minutes passed and I received a text, our table was ready!    The ambiance was modern, flat screen televisions, white leather chair with a dark brown frame, dark brown tables, red carpeting, and orange theme table settings. Our table was neatly prepared with the creative menu waiting to be opened. The waiter also gave us an iPad menu if we wanted to order cocktails, beers, wine, GR Gear, and desserts. For appetizers, we ordered the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers, Shake #5, and I got the Uber Cheeseburger. When we were done the waiter gave us the check and indicated that it is optional to fill out the survey.   I opened the check folder and saw that there was an iPhone prompting me to take the survey; pretty awesome.  We paid and left to continue our Vegas adventure.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SQ-L1eNKyfyZdvFsrLhzxw&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)   ::Food:: The Roasted Jalapeño Poppers were presented on a long narrow tray with small shot glasses. Each glass contained a white creamy flavorful sauce and one crunchy breaded jalapeno popper. They were not very spicy but we were warned that one contained a fiery surprise.  Inside was cheddar cheese, jalapeno, and cheddar ranch; the temperature was perfect. We thought there would only be one fiery surprise but I think we got two.  My tongue was burning and my nose was running;  it wasn't extremely hot but it was hot.  It was fun trying to guess which one had the fiery surprise. My Uber Cheeseburger was grilled over apple and alder wood.  It had Fontina cheese, raclette,  and goat cheese; The burger was cooked just right! Next is the Shake #5, it had chocolate hazelnut pudding, coffee shake, and praline cookie. The combination of all the flavors tasted good.  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=PXEvdFptJuNXo01jFbGRSw&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)   (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ns-hfFq7x7JIS7YDPTDWqg&userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg)  ::Highlight:: I was looking forward to eating at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant.  Just how I imagined it to be,  everything was perfect, decor, food and service.  I also liked how they utilized technology by having an iPad for a menu and an iPhone to complete a survey; a great way to be innovative.  ::Customer Service:: Even though it was very busy and a little hectic, the staff checked on us.  Everyone was friendly and attentive.  ::M's Notes:: -Inside seating  -Parking Garage -Valet Parking"}
{"text":"Came in to see a pretty long line, but if your a party of two the wait is short. Really short. But even if it was a little longer of a wait, it would be absolutely worth it.  I had the Farm Burger and sweet potato fries sans the sweet stuff they usually put on top. The accompanying chipotle ketchup is AMAZING! I won't describe the burger here since you can probably just check it out on the website, but trust me when I tell you this is the best burger I have ever had! Duck breast bacon... Need I say more."}
{"text":"Glad we tried it! I do think the Ipads are a bit pretentious, annoying, and slow down service every time the waiter has to explain the concept to each table.  I ordered the Euro Burger, I enjoyed it but wished I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger! My husband tried the all american and it was quality.  THE TRUFFLE FRIES WERE FABULOUS AND I AM NOT A FRY PERSON!  Good deal for a high quality burger on the strip! Glad we went, might be back, might not.  ALSO THE BURGERS WERE BEAUTIFUL, LOOKED LIKE THE PICTURE, AND THE TRUFFLE FRIES ARE BIG ENOUGH TO SPLIT BETWEEN 2 PEOPLE! VERY FILLING!  Our bill was $44 for 2 burgers, 1 truffle fries, and 2 waters... fyi"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this was the worst experience I've had in Vegas to date. The fries tasted like they were freeze dried and the onion rings were so greasy they left a kind of oily coating and after taste in my mouth. The burger buns were dry and the burgers  themselves were pretty much tasteless. We had 6 ppl at our table and frankly all of us were speechless. It was my suggestion to go there so that sucked big time. I'd shut THAT kitchen down! The noise level was absolutely deafening. The service was only mediocre and the uniforms the women wore were as tasteless as the burgers. Gordon you should be ashamed of yourself!"}
{"text":"The burgers were fantastic, although mine wasn't cooked properly. My waiter instantly took it back and brought me a fresh one within five minutes or so. Great service, excellent food! Would say it was the top food establishment we ate at!"}
{"text":"While the food was delicious,  I can't give Burgr a great review because my water glass was broken and the glass cut my thumb. They sent a security guard over to give me a bandaid. And that's it. They didn't really apologize and they didn't offer to do anything about it. It was an awful customer service experience.   Really Gordon, your food is great, but when I get a huge gash and start bleeding because your water glass was broken and all your staff does is give me a bandaid, doesn't give me faith in your restaurants."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Vegas, my girl and I decided to track down a couple of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.  The line was a little crazy when we showed up but the wait was well worth it.  BurGR was delicious!  We started off with an order of the gooey fries which were amazing.  Covered in cheese and pastrami, an egg and melted gooeyness (hence the name...haha) that in and of itself could be a meal, so be warned if you get the gooey fries, split a burger.  You will be full and in our case have to leave a little bit behind of the yummy burger behind.  I had the Farm Burger which had duck breast bacon, egg, and cheese on top of a burger.  More gooey goodness.  My girl had a Euro Burger and while I didn't try it it looked good and she enjoyed it immensely.  The wait staff are pretty attentive and friendly considering the hustle and bustle.  Will we be back?  Yes.....but maybe next time the gooey fries will be my meal for that day :-)"}
{"text":"Farmburger.  That's all I need to say.  I ordered that with a side of their truffle fries and my meal kept me satisfied all night.  That said, it's a good meal to have before you go out and drink!  I was on a good buzz all night.  I wasn't too full, and it didn't leave me feeling hungry too early in the night.  For a big party, the staff was very accommodating and everything seemed to go smoothly.  There were a dozen of us out for a birthday but we got a table at a decent time.  I love that we can check in and get notified as to when to come back for our reservations.  It keeps us from having to wait in line and waste time in Vegas!!  I'd definitely go back.  The Ramsay restaurant is better than one I've gone to in LA.  The burger was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and it's been a great experience both times. The line can get kinda long so i would recommend just sitting at the self-seating bar and you don't have to wait in line if there is an open seat!  I got the Euro Burger and Truffle fries which was both really good, The truffle aioli is great!  I also tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger which is probably my favorite burger so far but just be careful because it packs some heat and can be spicy to some."}
{"text":"There was a long line even after 2p, but it was worth the wait.  Burgers average $15 and up but taste good.  It looked deceivingly small, but my Earth Burger had more portobello than I had ever seen.  Everything is a la carte.  The fries with curry ketchup were good.  Mom had Soba  Chicken Noodle Salad which was surprisingly delicious.  Definitely check it out.   Very good food and service."}
{"text":"I seriously wish this place was located in Los Angeles because I would go all of the time!!!!! The line was long to go in but we waited maybe twenty five minutes. Everything is such perfection at this place. The server was knowledgable about everything. They gave us a tablet that had drink selections to choose from. He pointed out Gordon Ramsey's favorite beer innis and gun. We both chose that. We ordered the jalapeño poppers and two burgers. I had the uber cheese burger and he had the Hell's Kitchen burger and we shared the truffle fries. The jalapeños were amazing. The best I've ever had. Super fresh and they came with cheddar ranch. One was supposed to come extra hot with seeds but we honestly couldn't tell which one. The burgers were cooked perfectly and taste like smokey goodness. It was so filling. I love truffle and could smell the strong flavor, which I loved! Definitively will go back again when I return to lad Vegas next time."}
{"text":"All the hype without substance   Love that they text you when your table is ready so you don't just stand around waiting. That is the end of customer service, however.  I went to restroom right before we were seated and they went ahead and sat 3 members of our 4-some (not a problem), but when I walked up to the hostess stand and inquired about the rest of my party I was told to go \"look around\" for them. Not the customer service I would expect and it continued...  The thing I detest most about restaurants with waitstaff is when they play Food Lottery with my order. Every time they brought something to the table it was followed by \"who had XYZ item\" this was even repeated by the floor manager. That is reprehensible. Why bother taking our order if they cant be bothered to note who ordered which items.  The jalapeño poppers were tasty and the presentation was well done, although a bit overpriced at $12 for 6.   The burgers were terrible. I ordered the Uber Cheeseburger, adding duck bacon, cooked medium. It was a dry, flavorless, pre-processed appearing, overly grilled piece of $19 disappointment. The beef here does not begin to compare to Zinburger, the Grind, or Deluxe (Phoenix/Scottsdale) burger. I don't have a problem paying for a good burger - I love a good burger, but Burgr isn't it. The waitress didn't even comment on the fact that my husband and I got it to share and only ate half if it because it was that bad (dry, bad burger).  My 20 year old son ordered the Farm Burger and the egg was cooked perfectly, however the burger was just as poor quality as the Uber. Of note, this was ordered well and looked exceedingly similar to the doneness of my medium burger. He agreed it wasn't as good as other burgers we've had.  The parmesan fries were good, but truffle oil is so 10 years ago. The sweet potato fries were tasty as well, but they should be for $9 and $11 respectively. At least they easily serve a party of 4.  Shake 5 had good flavor but the pudding was difficult to manage and the straw with a diameter of a dime was just odd.  Another oddity was the regular drinks; the straws are shorter than the glasses. Our bus boy, who was the best part of our experience, saw that my hubby was not digging fishing his straw out of his glass and brought him a different glass. I love cool form and design, but not when it's a sacrifice to function!  Bottom line though, the burgers were sub-par and we won't be back and wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"The hog burger was the best burger I've ever had, Parmesan truffle fries were delicious but definitely need to be shared. Shake 4 was also good, would recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Aww.. I don't know if it's because I love Gordon on TV, I watch his shows, his cooking shows, and read his books.. Do I expect to much???  I was so excited to sit in his Burger joint, I could hardly wait to choose from his menu.. A couple things I have pet Peeve's about:  1. If you charge a Big Price you must Deliver, If you are going to charge $10.00 for a order of Fries or Onion Rings, at least make sure they are MADE TO ORDER!  I am sorry Gordon but at this restaurant, at this level, . . . Really, a window to let the Apps. be Pre-Cooked? ? ?  2. Make sure food is cooked to order, if it's not, then it had better be Heated to a HOT temp.. ( Unless it's sushi ) I like my food Hot and Smokin' still! AKA MADE TO ORDER! 3. If it doesn't taste good, I send it back.  The burger I ordered was the Duck Bacon, Egg, and Medium Rare... ( Border line Hot) but the flavor impact was there and I was thankful that the Bun was at least Toasted. . . Have to have a Toasted Bun right?  Unfortunately, for the price, service, and food, I won't be dining back... It was sad.. I wanted more...  It's a long line and not worth the wait, I'd rather go down the road to In and Out...  At least there I know everything is Cooked to Order! 1/4 the price as well for 4 people to eat for what you'll pay for one person...  Thank You, but ... so sad... Gordon' i am loosing faith in your restaurants..."}
{"text":"I've only been here 3 times but I've been given the wrong burger twice. I was here last week and asked the person who dropped off my burger if it was medium well as my friend ordered the same one but medium rare.  He said he had no idea but that it was the right one since it was supposed to be served to the person sitting in seat.  Of course, I got screwed again. My friend enjoyed the burger I was supposed to get while I waited for another burger. I don't see how they could have messed up on 2 of the 3 times I've been there.  For the love of Pete, label those wooden toothpicks you put in the burger with \"well done\", \"medium\", etc. It's a simple solution.  The burger was OK but for the price and for a restaurant of this caliber, I really expect grass-fed beef. I've had better burgers in Vegas at Broadway Burger and Mingo.  Plus, I think charging $9 for onion rings is outrageous."}
{"text":"Fish and chips sandwich....delicious! Parm truffle fries...delicious! Onion rings....delicious! American burger...average.  Noisy restaurant.  Don't feel the need to go back, but recommend all go once!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!  The reason I'm giving this place a 4 and not of 5 is because it took way to long for the food to come out! Just way too long. It was almost ridiculous.  Anyways onto the food. The burgers here are pretty damn good. We had the Southern chicken and the All American I believe. The chicken was far better than the all American beef. Don't get me wrong, both are worth the price it's just that the chicken burger was more flavourful while the beef burger was sweeter than I wanted (sweet pickles).   The burgers are roughly 14 US and that does NOT include fries. We ordered the truffle fries on the side, which were tasty but I don't know, next time I'd rather get regular or yam. I didn't love them.  The sevice was friendly. Our waiter kept refilling our water but our food took forever. We were starving.  Overall, loved this place. Fantastic food! I am definetly going back!"}
{"text":"Hamburgers are amazing. Service is the best. Thank you Gordon for bringing a burger joint up to higher standards."}
{"text":"We wanted something casual so we came here last night. There was a bit of a line but it only took 10 minutes or so to be seated. We ordered the American burger, the Farm burger, and the parmesan fries. Both burgers were excellent but the fries weren't great. A little too much cheese sprinkled on top and not really worth the $11. Overall we were pretty satisfied."}
{"text":"The blue burger is good but I thought it could be better. The truffle parm fries were not good. They were overlooked so I sent them back. The next ones were better but not worth the $$$. The shake was delicious. I did not think k it was worth the money"}
{"text":"As you walk toward BurGr you'll see a line out the door! Don't walk away and think it's not worth the wait! Get in that line and get ready for a gastro-yummified FEAST! We ordered the Chanterelle burger, The Blue burger and The American. We also ordered 1 order of Onion rings & 1 order of the Parmesan truffle fries- these were amazing! The onion ring garlic aoli was better than the rings themselves. They were cool to touch when they came out. The portions on the fries and onion rings were enough for the 3 in our party to share. We had lots leftover. The burgers were Amazing! The buns had black sesame seeds and were perfectly toasted. My Chanterelle had an onion marmalade and Arugula on it. I ordered it medium and it came out perfectly cooked. My sisters Blue burger had Maytag blue cheese and Arugula. Good, I've had better though. Not enough Blue for me.  The American was very good too. Just boring for my taste but my other sister enjoyed it. I also had a better than Starbucks cup of coffee which sounds weird but is totally true. All said I would definitely go back to eat here again. I didn't even mind paying the $89 tab after that wonderful meal! Yum!"}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious here.  Our waitress was amazing.  The hostesses are snotty, overpaid young girls who need to get an education and learn some customer service skills.  The table was stinky because they don't clean their rags properly.  Disappointing that this joint is not being managed well."}
{"text":"I love Gordon Ramsey so I wanted to try one of his restaurants. The burger was very good. Very juicy & flavorful. Not the best burger I've ever had but I'd go back. I had the bleu cheese burger but there were a couple of other ones I wanted to try too! The sauces for the fries were really good. The only thing that was a little annoying was that there was a line to get in, but when we had finally gotten seated, we saw that there were more than plenty of tables available. I've worked in restaurants and understand that they could be understaffed in the dining room or kitchen that day & that could back things up, but by seeing the number of employees on the floor & in the kitchen I don't think that was the case. When we left there was still a line of about 15-20 ppl and there were a bunch of tables open in the place. I hope they're  not doing that just to make the place seem popular, because the food alone will keep people coming back."}
{"text":"Im just gonna say it. Best burger ever. Got the hells kitchen one rare and it was heaven. HEAVEN! !!"}
{"text":"This was honestly the best burger i have ever eaten. Highly recommend the farm burger because anything with an egg is absolutely amazing. Alex was our server and he made the experience not only by strategically planning out our perfect burger, but showing off his witty personality keeping us entertained. Such an amazing experience! Thank you Gordon ramsay"}
{"text":"Our first stop in Vegas, no regrets! Best burger I have had in a while and it was the American, with the norm toppings.  Food quality is definitely noticeable. The decorations are great, atmosphere is great. Cant wait to go again! Highly Recommend it!"}
{"text":"Came and sat at the bar with my fiancé and he ordered the farm burger and I ordered Hell's Kitchen burger along with the gooey fries.  Everything tasted good, but took about 20-25 mins to finally get our food.  My recommendation is if you get the gooey fries, get only one burger to share for two people.  That night, we were really stuffed and we didn't finish our fries.  Another thing which I dislike is that since we were sitting by the bar, we can see what comes through the expo station and I don't like seeing how our fries have been sitting there for a very long time before getting served."}
{"text":"I don't normally eat burgers but I had to try it because my friend Amy kept on talking about it. I got the fish sandwich and it was huge. The bread was very moist and toasted to perfection. It almost seems like each bread was baked or taken out of the oven when a sandwich is ordered. I love bread and I loved the bread on my sandwich  and it made my sandwich tasted so much better. Amy ordered a turkey burger. I love the cranberry sauce that was on it. Lee ordered I believe the Ramsay's burger. It was OK. Ekka also ordered a fish sandwich. All the burgers were huge, more than enough for one person. We also ordered alfredo fries and another fries. I liked the alfredo fries. It was new to me and very rich, almost like eating alfredo pasta. I gave it a 4 star just because they made us waited even though there were empty tables and we were very hot with 2 infants with us. We had walked over to Planet Hollywood  from our hotel in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burger and fries I have ever had....and honestly, I don't see it being topped ever. I had the Farm Burger and sweet potato fries.  The dishes are thought out well, with contrasting flavors and high quality ingredients. Pricing is very competitive  (in relation to other eateries on the Strip). Only negative was the 45 minute wait for two, however the food more than made up for it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Farm Burger: Topped with duck breast bacon, fried egg, and cheddar. The burger was nice and juicy and made to a perfect medium-rare. I had to have a side of aioli with my fries which was absolutely flavorful. A few of my friends have never had aioli but found out they loved it after I had them try it."}
{"text":"The burgers were great. Some of the best burgers I've eaten actually. We went with a group of 7 and all the burgers were good. I had the pork burger which was tasty but a bit on the dry side, but If you want something different then I recommend the pork burger too! I love how they actually cook your burger to medium or medium rare if you want and that the beef tastes really fresh.   The reason why I knock it down 1 star is because of the other stuff.   We got one of the fries with bacon, fried egg, and cheese on it. It was meh. The service was also kind of meh."}
{"text":"Well,  I was  ready for a superior burger at BurGR. I'm a huge Gordon Ramsey fan and was sure I would be writing a great review. Not so!  Old Gordon dropped his standards.  The burger was not flavorful and the truffle fries were undercooked and greasy.   Probably better than the one rating,  but this is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant so the expectations were high. Go to BLT instead.   Gordon - I know you're making a lot of money and building a brand,  but you need to keep the standards high.  If you don't change things,  you may find BurGR on kitchen nightmares."}
{"text":"So funny to have an Englishman do burgr.  Any case. The burgers aren't huge if your hungry. It's ok.  I think I like counters more.   Had the hella kitchen not spicy at all.   The truffle fries were amazing. Fried slow to a crisp  Smoothie wow. Got the strawberry one yum.   I think I did like better than Holsteins but again counters has it beat"}
{"text":"Huge wait - I think I stood in line for nearly an hour! Server was friendly and seated us quickly once we got to the front though. While standing in line, you might want to stay a bit further from the giant fireplace thing - it's really warm next to it, despite how \"cool\" it is. Unintended pun.  Anyways, I was just thinking about giving this place a 3 because the burgers are nothing special and mine was overcooked, the shakes are decent (adding pudding to them is delicious), and the sweet potato fries were industry standard (with an excellent sauce, but the powdered sugar was not necessary)...  ...but then I remembered the Jalapeno Poppers. Most certainly the best jalapeno popper I've ever had in my entire life. Roasting the jalapeno takes the bitterness of the pepper off, while mellowing out the spiciness a bit. The cheese was deliciously melted when you bit into the popper, which was also nicely fried and crunchy. The choice to use half a jalapeno prevents the possible \"slide out\", as well as making sure the cheese is the first flavor to come through, and not overwhelmed. And lastly, the hellfire ranch sauce the poppers are served in couldn't be beat - housemade ranch with hot sauce? Bomb.com  Make sure you bring your TotalRewards Card! You can get $1 off every item you order (which should just be 2 jalapeno poppers and a milkshake, forget the burgers)."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you come to Vegas, it's a must visit. So juicy and amazingly delicious. You won't be disappointed.  Prices are very reasonable and service is friendly and welcoming. This isn't a date place, it's a-\"eat a good burger and grab a beer\" kinda place. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Time for a staff evaluation. Hey Server - tall, skinny blond woman - if you recently got less than your expected tip, evaluate how serve customers and try to act like you have an ounce of courtesy to all your tables and not a select one. Server never uttered a word after taking our order and didn't bother to ask whether we needed anything.   Food was cooked perfectly to my medium well preference. I ordered the American burger and sweet potato fries. They literally added sweetness to the fries by sprinkling powdered sugar and having a sweet aioli condiment which I didn't really like. I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"Wow, the burgers here are amazing.  The fries were good too!  Everything about this place was great!  Apparently, there's always a long line, but we got lucky and grabbed dinner early and we didn't run into a crowd."}
{"text":"Had the Farm Burger.  Unreal.  We waited for about 1 hour to get sat, they actually texted us when our table was ready.  The Farm Burger had a fried egg on top, bacon, cheese, it was very tasty.  I'll be going back here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Staff was nice. Nice clean space. Burger was good. But nothing special really. Their website says gluten free menu available. So we mistakenly thought that meant they had gluten free buns. I mean, it is a burger joint and gluten free buns are easy. But no. So the person i was with got a Cesar salad. Not exactly what you look forward to going to a Gordan Ramsey restaurant. Needless to say we didn't bother going to his steakhouse as planned. They probably wouldn't have gluten free steak...."}
{"text":"I've NEVER cried from eating something spicy before. I've NEVER eaten something so spicy to the point where no words came out of my mouth... where I couldn't even move my tongue. UNTIL I ATE THE HELLS KITCHEN BURGER. I'm sure the darn roasted jalapeno in my burger was an outlier and I just got one spicy SOB (because that HAS happened to me before). But GEEZ. Needless to say, I'll never get that burger again. The first few bites of the burger were actually good, delicious I might say! It was well into half-way of my burger where the skin of the jalapeno didn't break as I was taking my bite..... and I ended up pulling the entire jalapeno into my mouth with the small bite of my burger... then the meal went south. And I couldn't talk for a good 30 minutes waiting for the pain to subside. The waitress couldn't refill the water quick enough.  Granted, the burger probably would've been dang good if that didn't happen. Oh- it was also cooked well done, even though I asked for medium... And I also ate some of my boyfriend's mushroom burger, which was also really good.  DO NOT ORDER THE HOT POCKETS!!!! WARNING: WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT ORDER THESE 12 DOLLAR BITES. Literally, 1 bite (each). One bite for me, one bite for my boyfriend.. the whole thing was gone... AND IT WASN'T EVEN GOOD :( It's a confused dish that just tastes weird.   Coffee milkshake was ehh. Not much coffee flavor. Probably pass next time.  2 people: 1 appy, 2 burgers, 1 milkshake = $80 after tip and tax.   Will definitely be back for the burgers though!!!"}
{"text":"Britney is the best... Highly knowledgable about the menu.. Superior customer skills { Britney is HeRe} ~~~~~~ Our sitting was delayed so they comped us with 4 awesome cocktails... ~~~~~~ So far we had the Fury Chicken wings, And the truffle fries.......Aweeeesomeeee ~~~~~~ Ohhhh my GoooDd the Euro burger was A-Mazing!!!!l"}
{"text":"We've visited this place for years. The burgers are great, very original combinations with the best condiments. And the milk shakes are heavenly, pure indulgence. Staff is actually friendly. So what else do you need to know? You won't regret it."}
{"text":"200th review hype!! Where else to celebrate than my long awaited review of BURGR!   Another place to check off on my Las Vegas must eat bucket list. This one has been a long time coming. I have been a Gordon Ramsay fan for quite some time now and always wanted to eat at one of his restaurants. Since I am a huge fan of burgers, I thought why not try out BURGR?!   This restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood near one of the many entrances. It took us a while to find since the casinos are built like a maze but once we found the line and the crazy fire lit sign, you know you have arrived. Our party was fairly large and the wait came out to be about 2 hours or so. It only added to the anticipation. Once we got seated, our waiter was very informative and pleasant to talk to. All the burger descriptions looked tasty and I wish there was a way to sample each one but ultimately I decided on getting the most expensive burger on the menu:  Hog Burger - mangalitsa pork, english sharp cheddar, apple butter, arugula   Also an order of:   Truffle Parmesan Fries - hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli  The burger was truly the most unique experience. I have never had a burger with pork and the result was very positive. The pork was very moist and pulled apart when taking a bit into it. Combining it with the cheese and the arugula to complement it, you have the making of a great burger even if there is no beef in it. The fries are pretty self explanatory, the perfect side for any burger.   Now normally I would say that the best part of dining here was the food but on this occasion I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. GR himself dining at his own restaurant. Now I never imagined in a million years that I would see someone that I look up to in person let alone at his own dining establishment. I certainly was star struck and it gave me a sense of respect for him dining at his own restaurant.   I highly recommend you add this to your list of places to eat while visiting Las Vegas if you haven't done so already. BURGR is quite possibly one of the best gourmet burgers that I have had and you can count on me coming here again and again every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"The waiters are very friendly and professional but, this is the period, the service is very slow: for a burger I waited about half an hour! By the way The burger taste was great and amazing the plating. No words about the location... The bill was quite expensive: about 15 £ without tip."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great food, excellent waiters cant wait to go back!  The burgers are fantastic and dont forget the fries"}
{"text":"Always a sucker for burger and fries.  This place did not disappoint.  I got the Farm Burger because I like burgers with a fried egg.  My friend got the Hog Burger and that was good too.  My other friend got the Southern Yardbird Burger and I liked it more than mine.  I like my burgers with some veggies in it.  Nothing beats a burger with some nice crispy lettuce in it.  The mustard bbq sauce was a nice touch as well.  If my farm burger can some kind of sauce, it probably would have tasted better.  No burger is complete without french fries of course.  We got the truffle parmesan fries.  They were good considering I'm not a huge fan of truffle.  You can taste the truffle and it wasn't overpowering, so I liked it.  There was a lot of parmesan on it but you can just brush that off.  It came with truffle aioli and chipotle ketchup.  Those weren't bad but I love original ketchup.  Service was good.  Your server and busboy were both there to refill drinks and get anything you asked for.  They were on top of it with the refills.  The alcoholic drinks menu was on a iPad and the check came with an iPod for you to give your feedback, that was fancy.  Prices are what you would expect in Vegas I think.    I would definitely go back but would probably get the Southern Yardbird Burger next time."}
{"text":"Wow, can this place deliver a delicious burger and the price feels fair for Vegas, and heck even most major markets.    So we didn't stay here but ending up Ubering it over to test this place out.  I'd say.. Worth it.  Why? Delicious, juicy burgers feel like a rarity in Vegas.  We opted for the farm burger and truffle fries.  The burger was super satisfying- the fried egg had just enough soft yolk to ooze all over the burger, the duck bacon was crispy on the edges, and had caramelized to perfection.  Yum.  So our burger was a tad over I thought.  We asked for medium rare and got medium. It was still savory and I'd go back again.   The truffle fries were pretty good, seasoned nicely, fried to perfection, but I thought the truffle flavor was lacking, though they were generously sprinkled with Parmesan.  The aioli was creamy and perfect, I thought the ketchup tasted like puréed tomatoes. Not bad just not good.    We started with the jalapeño poppers, and this may be a Texas thing but I thought these were lackluster.  I don't think any spice came through for me and the cheddar filling was artificial tasting.  The breading was a thick.  I'd skip them if I came again.  Presentation was really nice in shot glasses. Compared to the flavor and prep of the burger or burGR, they were not up to par.  Our service was pretty good.  The staff here felt really positive despite having a packed house. We got checked on a few times initially, but towards the end of our meal, our drinks were empty, and no one came by again.  Overall, delicious burGR, alright sides, good service.  Recommended if you need a fix"}
{"text":"My daughter requested that we have a few of her teenage friends come along with us to try Burgr for her birthday. I was pleasantly surprised!   If you live here in Vegas, the strip tends to be more a nuisance than a novelty. But not for the sake of my daughter's birthday request, we just wouldn't have bothered. With the combination of being located inside a strip casino and being a Gordon Ramsay property, I expected everything to be ridiculously overpriced, but considering the factors involved, it was very reasonably priced.   The menu is ala carte, with the burgers ranging from $12-$16. The fries cost between $8-$11, and easily feed two. Appetizers cost about the same as the entrees, and the homemade shakes ($9) are just divine!  Everything ordered all around was absolutely delicious! We were also pleased with the service. I have but one complaint about the entire experience. They should never have left the restaurant open to the casino. It is so terribly loud in there. When you can hear the nickel-mongers cheering their $12 jackpot over the person seated next to you, it's time to consider building some sort of partition.  Otherwise, we had a lovely experience at Burgr!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay you have outdone yourself!   I came here a few years ago and I was not all that impressed- food was good but it wasn't incredible. I returned over this past weekend to give it another try. The food this time around was absolutely flawless!  I had the hog burger and my girlfriend and I shared the gouie fries.  I have never had a better burger in my life! The meat was extremely juicy, perfectly cooked, and packed with flavor. The white cheddar cheese, bbq pork, bacon, and crispy onions complemented each other perfectly. Overall the burger was impeccably balanced and blended the flavors of sweet, salty, and savory perfectly. No one element overpowered the others. It was easy to tell that the burger was made with high levels of care with only the best of ingredients.  The gouie fries were also very yummy. The melted Gouda cheese on top had the rich flavor I was looking for but the sauce was not overpowering. The fries were nice and crispy and did not get soggy quickly like many fries do in this kind of dish. I would have liked to have gotten a little more flavor out of the prosciutto ham in the mix. Overall a very good dish.   I also liked that they had a very exotic variety of drinks on tap. I got a \"Rince Cochon\", a beer from Belgium that I probably couldn't have found anywhere else in Las Vegas. It was a good beer, but I was more impressed by the fact that they offered such a beer.  Service was also fantastic!  Overall well worth the money. I have eaten at quite a few fine dining places that charge way more than BurGR but I have to say that this place tops them all."}
{"text":"Bomb.com!! Went here last night with the hubster and it was sooo good. My expectations were high because it's a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and I was not disappointed. Service was fast and friendly and the food was phenomenal.  We started with the jalapeño poppers- Best ever  I had the farm burger: cheddar, duck bacon and a fried egg- best burger I've ever had. Not greasy, perfect.  Hubby had the Hogburger- awesome flavor!  I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible! Not coming back here ever again and here is why:  - they make you wait 15-20 when there are 15+ tables open. (great way to make people line up outside to get you hyped it and make the restaurant look good)  - our waiter was beyond horrible. My knife was dirty, so I nicely asked for a new one and it never came (ended up using the bf's). Our watier was SOOO damn lazy that he didn't really take care of us after he gave our order. We saw him hanging around the bar chit chatting with coworkers  - OTHER waiters are all there to hang out and chit chat (about 10-15 of them). There was even one COUPLE WAITER who was dating was holding hands on the floor! Are you serious?! You're dating someone at work and you're holding hands in front of customers?! BIG NO NO!  - Burger was OK. But wasn't the greatest. In-and-Out taste so much better! Malt was a miss for us and nasty.  - Waiter talked us into getting the pudding malt, tasted so bad that I took 2 sips and left it there (i should have sent it back...grrr)  - After we complained that our waiter is no where to be found and won't come to our table, another waiter tried to cover his ass by saying they switched shifts so we have a new waiter. Umm..hello! No one came over to notify us when just about every restaurant waiter does let customers know of the shift and waiter change. This was just a complete lie to help cover his coworker!  Gordon Ramsey, I suggest you have a secret shopper/customer to dine in and see how horrible this restaurant is. Everyone there is there to hang around and not work. I'm very disappointed in your restaurant and will not be returning again.  ONE TO NO STAR for horrible crappy service, expensive place, useless wait, i can go on and on."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had!!!!! And their truffle fries are to die for. Service is also great and the staff are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!  I had the Farm Burger and my wife had the Hell's Kitchen burger!  (The roasted jalapeño gave a very good kick!). We also shared the Truffle Parmesan Fries!  There was more than enough to share.  Oh yeah, Shake #5 is worth the $9!!  Thick, rich and damn good!!!    The burgers and food was excellent, as expected after watching Ramsay b!tch out all those people on TV!  But the best part of the experience was the customer service!  It was crowded so we took a spot at the counter!  Our bartender/waiter was phenomenal!  I just can't recall his name!  Great guy, good convos, funny, always checked in on us!  These guys epitomize customer service!  The next time we're back in Vegas we're going here for burgers!!  Thank you Burgr staff!"}
{"text":"Cons- Long wait with terrible service. The waitresses have way too many tables and don't check on you enough. After we were seated we waited 15 mins to order. After we ordered we waited 20 mins for our milkshakes and we were supposed to have fries with them. They brought the milkshakes without the fries and forgot the spoon with the milkshake. We had to wait another 10 mins to get our spoon, no joke.  After about 40 mins we got our burgers. They brought the fries out when we were half way though our burgers. They also forgot to put the sauce on my girlfriends burger so we had to ask for it. More waiting.  Verdict. Service ruined everything. Fries and burger were pretty good though not worth the time we waited to be seated and definitely not worth the horrible service.  The milkshakes were fake tasting and not worth the price. The pudding was a nice touch but the fake flavor was unbearable.  I will never go back and would not recommend to anyone. Not like Chef Ramsey gives a shit, he doesn't cook at any of these places he just slaps his name on it."}
{"text":"Landed late in Las Vegas and we needed a midnight snack so we ended up here. We waited an hour, but I guess that is Vegas. We got the onion rings which were perfect! We also got the sweet potatoes fries which were just too sweet...don't get them. Two of us had the Farm Burger which is suppose to be their best burger but it was salty. I was really disappointed. For a high end burger place, salt is the last thing one should worry about. The rest of the burgers were good per my friends."}
{"text":"This place is FUEGO !   Easily the Best burger in the City.  I've eaten almost everything on the menu but really enjoy the Euro Burger.  Truffle aioli, goat cheese and warm tomato - BOOM !  Gordon also makes up a great shake but the Chocolate Hazelnut pudding, coffee, praline cookie is mind blowing.  If your UP any money THIS IS THE PLACE TO SPEND IT."}
{"text":"Food is good. I had chicken wings. They were breaded (did not say breaded on menu). They are the drumstick part only. Good sized drumsticks but fatty. A little too fatty for my taste. Too much fat makes them slimy under the skin. I would not order them again. Service was good. Nice servers working their butts off. Steve had the Standard Dawg. It was huge!!! He liked it a lot."}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place! I seriously think you could close youe eyes and point at anything on the menu and it would be mouthwatering perfection! The sweet potato fries and the jalapeno poppers were AMAZING! We are definitely sad we dont have this restaurant in our city!!"}
{"text":"If you're expecting to be wowed i would suggest going elsewhere..  After asking the hostess how long the wait would be approximately and she estimated 30 minutes.. My partner and I waited in line from 8:59pm on a Sunday night.. with 34 other patrons lined up before us... until 10:04pm...   We were standing at the front of the line for 14minutes while 5 other large groups were seated first and then i watched impatiently for another 5 minutes while 2 tables were free but the 3 'hostesses' were too busy doing not a whole lot, to seat us..  When i finally asked how many other groups were in front of us she promptly replied they were waiting for tables to be cleared.. when clearly they weren't.   I probably wouldn't have minded if the staff were flat chat and run off their feet but i was disgusted to see 15 empty tables shortly after i was seated with still a ridiculous long line outside..(4 of these tables were ready for patrons but the hostesses were 'busy').   Our server was great although it was a little difficult to hear him with the noise in the restaurant.    Food came out in a reasonable amount of time which was surprising and what was also surprising was how bland the Hells Kitchen Burger was. The meat was cooked well, the ingredients were fresh but it lacked the pizzazz and spice that you would expect after reading the description. Onion rings were probably the best i've ever had - crispy, light and full of flavour without being overpowering. Sweet potato fries were good and the fury chicken appetisers were tasty enough. The chicken soba salad was fresh and a good size however a couple of the flavours clashed.   A table of 6 left shortly after we were seated and the table was not cleared the entire time we were there, along with a 2 seater table next to us. That would explain why we were waiting for a ridiculous amount of time.   2 managers on duty and neither thought it was in their interest to ensure the tables were cleared or the patrons were seated in a prompt manner. Instead... they were happily giggling and chatting in a corner with a few of the waitstaff.   1 star because our server was competent, 1 star because we didn't have to wait long for our food and the onion rings were great.  Apparently the general manager of this place is Darren Heller (our server informed us of this because i didn't want to speak to a clearly incompetent manager on duty) Darren this place clearly needs an overhaul... perhaps Gordon Ramsey would like to review his own named restaurant..    All in all a complete letdown on top of a ridiculously appalling wait time. Would i recommend you to go there? Hells no."}
{"text":"Good service and food. For muslims: I recommend fries and sweet fries with earth burger. It marches the reputation and is not very pricy"}
{"text":"Had the Hell's Kitchen burger with truffle fries.  Burger was great, fries are large enough to share.  Will be back to try the duck burger.  Nice beer selection, shake selection is good too."}
{"text":"Quick review.. I loved the one other member of our party of 4 loved it, the other two thought it was okay... At like 11pm on a Thursday we went for dinner once we checked in. Was told 30-45 minutes, gave our number so they could text us, 5 minutes later while watching the Bellagio fountains across the street, the text came.   Service meh, waitress had friends sit at the table next to us about half way through and it was like we didn't exist.   The Poppers were EXCELLENT we all agreed on that, the Maui Onion Rings, good (but I'm not a huge parmesan fan) so I didn't expect to love them since I knew they had them.   I had the Farm burger medium rare and perfect! Was one of the best I've ever had. Duck Bacon, sharp cheddar & an egg... SO GOOD...   Wife had the Euro burger seemed to really enjoy it.   Friends spit a burger (not sure which) but they asked for medium well (and it was split) so you could see the temp and it was medium rare-rare so it had to be sent back. But by this time out waitress had stopped paying attention to us, so making this happen was a task.   Food was very good, I'll chalk up the poor service to our waitress. Good ambiance, would try again.   We also got some of the pudding shakes to go a few days later as we passed through (too full to try the first trip in) those were excellent. Something you don't really get anywhere else, but worth it as a togo item to try if you don't have the time to stop in and want something sweet and tasty."}
{"text":"The food is very good. But now that I have been there two times I have found a severe lack if good service. There servers are very professional but there main concern is to get you in and out as quickly as possible. Every time I feel like I am being hustled to eat quickly and get out."}
{"text":"Having the uber cheeseburger, truffle Parmesan cheese fries, and a hazelnut chocolate shake:)...It's recommended to order your burger medium and they know what they're talking about.  My Uber Cheeseburger was juicy and full of flavor.  It had 3 different types of cheese and carmelized onions on a Brioche bun.  The parmesan fries were crispy and seasoned perfectly.  The shake was to die for.  The chocolate was a pudding on top of the hazlenut flavored shake.  It was topped off with a thick whip cream and a praline cookie.  It is pricy, but what do you expect?...it's Gordon Ramsey."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a burger then come HERE!  The ambiance is cool and modern with fire along the wall where the sign is.  We were seated pretty quickly even though it was busy and handed an IPAD with the cocktail menu on it.  I ordered the Earth Burger which was a portobello, fontina cheese, arugula, and tomato on a much better bun than just an ordinary bun.  My husband ordered the Farm Burger which was duck breast bacon, cheddar cheese, and a fried egg.  Both were equally delicious and unique burgers that I've never had before.  I can't think of anything this restaurant could have done better.  Good service, great food, and fun location for people watching.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Will definitely be back on our next visit. Sad we waited so long to try it. Had the Hell's Kitchen burger and totally recommend!  Husband had the chili dawg...awesome and not what you think. Go for the truffle fries:)"}
{"text":"Hi again, well I did it, I am the first and only person to complete the entire menu at BurGR, got to meet Gordon himself too at the year anniversary party, he was funny and nice, just a great guy you would want to share a beer with - as usual on my recent trip I dined at BurGR about 4 times, I have eating everything on the menu so now I'm creating new things like having a burger with pita bread instead of a bun, but the best thing is a burger wrapped on lettuce, Paleo diet freindly! (thanks to my boy Garret on dayshift) it was awesome, I even had my buddy Jason try it and he liked it too and ordered one himself the next visit. As always everyone there is amazing, Managers Darren, Benji and Emily came and talked to me and always make every visit great, Servers Garret, Jahaira, Alex with glasses, James, Ginger, cute lil blond girl, guy with Mohawk (sorry couldn't remember everyone's name when I was writing this) and a cast of others always take damn good care of me, I usually ask for 3 tea's and a water (no lemon, that's very important and it's a test to see if my server is really listening to me), cause I drink pretty quickly and they always get it right, are fun to talk to, know the menu front to back, make good suggestions, which in turn makes it for a better dinning experience, also the busser's Jennifer and Kelly kicked butt too, the chefs are always entertaining and friendly, even when they are busy as crap, they will still take time out to say hi, one of the reason's I always sit back there is I like to watch everybody working in the kitchen and see how things run \"HANDS PLEASE\" - over all I have not had a bad experience yet, still don't understand anyone's bad reviews, but I guess every one's experience isn't always the same as everyone else's right, If you had a bad experience the first time I would suggest a second trip back, maybe walk to the front of the line and ask for a manager and just \"calmly\" explain that your first experience wasn't that great and I bet they will go over and beyond to make sure that doesn't happen on your 2nd experience. As for me I go back to Vegas in 18 days and I will probably eat at least 3 times there, the entire staff from the girls at the front, managers, servers, busser's, chefs are always incredible to me and any one I have brought there or told to dine there, even if you don't want a burger go for the desserts ;) till next time David Cagle"}
{"text":"Gourmet burgers! Of course that comes with a gourmet price but who cares you're in Vegas!  The farm burger was amazing! They put sunny side up egg and duck bacon in it, along with the juicy, flavorful beef patty. The one thing that set them apart from other burger places was the crispy, perfectly toasted bun. I don't get why burger joints don't bother toasting the buns. You know how big of a difference it makes and it really doesn't take much time! If I had my own grill, I would for sure toast every bun before the burger is served. I really like the runny egg in the burger. This is such a great idea and how come no other burger joints follow suit? A lot of times we run into dry, oversalted burgers. The runny egg solves the problem, unless you have a serious fear of salmonella.  The reason I didn't give it a 5 stars is because one of our burgers was a bit lackluster - the pork burger. It was presented as a special item on the menu, apart from all the other burgers listed on the other page. So we thought, it must be an asskicking burger! Nope. I still like my regular beef burger more. I guess the pork that they used was not fat enough to give a good meaty flavor.  Another reason is the lack of crispiness of the sweet potato fries. For some reason, it seems hard to achieve the same level of crispiness of regular french fries in sweet potato fries. I don't know why. I have never made my own fries before. But I did have crispy sweet potato fries in a southern food restaurant before so I know it's possible even though it's rare. Paying that steep of a price, I'd expect GR would deliver some crispy sweet potato fries. Nope. They did not. Yes, the sauce and the confectioners' sugar were amazing addition to the fries, but if your fries are not crispy, they have failed halfway already.   The service was friendly and the decor was really nice and interesting! I like how they open up the kitchen for show. The design of the menu is very creative too. We also took a picture with the screaming Gordon Ramsay as the backdrop.  This is a very good burger place. I loved my farm burger. But when I am in Vegas again, I'd probably wanna try other burger places. If you haven't been, you should definitely check it out! I would say it still has lived up to its hype.   Also, there wasn't a long wait either. You can give them your number and they'll text you when the table is ready. I think we waited for 20 minutes during prime lunch time. Not bad. It wasn't as crazy as Bacchanal buffet at least..."}
{"text":"Premium burgers... and reasonably priced!  Not a bad combination for a \"celebrity chef\" establishment on the Vegas Strip!  I had the hog burger, washed down with a tasty beer on tap.  The server was incredibly attentive, helpful... a real pleasure to talk to.  He had nice things to say about his boss, Mr. Ramsey, who stops by a few times a month.    My wife and I shared a side of gooey fries.  They were delicious, and we could have shared them with another couple.  All portion sizes are, in fact, very generous.  Come hungry, or plan to share.  We felt bad about the uneaten food we left behind."}
{"text":"Great grub, and what you'd expect from a place with Gordon Ramsay's name on it!  I had the fish sandwich because I wasn't quite feeling like a burger that day. Probably one of the best fish sandwiches I've ever had!!! I must admit the fries were good and the bite of a burger I did try was very delish too. Only downside was it was a little pricey but hey, you are in Vegas!  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm. This is my second time at this restaurant. The burgers and fish entrees are awesome. The drinks were excellent. Our service was great."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best burger I've ever had! That may not be much coming from me since I don't consider myself much of a burger fan but my husband certainly thought so and he absolutely loves burgers. That being said, I did order their pork burger. I loved how soft and tender the meat was. I did take a bite of my husband's burger, which I was expecting to be tougher than mine since it was the customary beef patty, but on the contrary it was just as tender as my pork patty and practically felt like it melted in my mouth. So delicious and the prices weren't too horrible considering its location and the hype. I'd definitely recommend it or come back if I ever return to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"So it was a really random night and we decided to come here. The restaurant is really casual and host were kind of blah. We got seated and our server came right away. I order their Earth Burger which has no meat and it was good. Nothing special but I enjoyed it. Their fries lacked flavor and were a little on the dry side. My friend had one of their milkshakes with something similar to Creme brûlée on top and it was delicious. Over all it was okay, I honestly wouldn't die to come back. But our server Tammy was AMAZING!!!!! Loved her."}
{"text":"My son is a huge Gordon Ramsey fan, didn't take much persuasion for us to try it out.  Omg best burger ever... our table had several different burgers (BBQ,  Americam, Euro, Farm burgers and a hotdog) literally the best burgers we've ever eaten.  My daughter's hotdog went to the wrong table and after alittle wait she got hers (waiters were nice enough not to charge for the inconvenience)."}
{"text":"Grodon - they can't even cook a burger to order correctly!  I had to send it back then waited until everyone in my party was done before I got it back.  Furthermore, terrible fries - maybe it had to do with the fact that they fries and onion rings were sitting under the heat lamp (which you can see - open kitchen).  Anyway, not worth the wait to get a table."}
{"text":"It was ok, Just ok. The service was good, the people are very nice. You see Gordon yelling all the time you would think he would be more of a perfectionist. The people in my party would have given 2 stars I gave them  3 and I will be back to give them another chance. I was disappointed but not enough to write them off. everyone has a bad day. I hope I can give a better review next time around. I did not like the taste of the burgers. There is something different and not in a way that appealed to me,. I don't like to write long negative reviews so I will stop here. I will try them again and see if I can revisit this review."}
{"text":"Not the best place to eat in Vegas. To be honest, I'm a little disappointed with Ramsey's restaurant! The wait for the burger to be brought to your table is around 45min. The fries were cold, everyone is super slow there. Not enough wait stuff. And, the burger itself was overly salty and just not tasty. Wouldn't recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Yes the wait was long, but most buffets and restaurants have long waits on a Sunday. Our waiter wasn't just friendly, but also knew about everything on the menu and gave us some great recommendations. I ended up ordering the Farm Burger and truffle fries. You have to try it. Delicious! Definitely coming back to try the other burgers on their menu and to get more of their fries!"}
{"text":"I have to say its true, the burger is pretty darn good. Not the best ever, but very good.  food review:  The patty is too symmetrical and the thickness even, which is nice to the sandwich, although it did feel that it was quite firm in its shape, as if it was made in a factory and shipped frozen, and might have something added to keep the shape... I don't like pre-made too much.  I got medium rare, and that was cooked perfectly. A darker pink evenly distributed within and soft texture. It was not too juicy, I think they use leaner meat (I like fat). Although the patty was not very thick, they are good at making sure the inside stays pink. Ok, now I had the 'Hell's Kitchen' burger as many recommended it here. It was not spicy. And the asadero cheese was almost un noticeable in flavor.. but I enjoyed it overall.  I also ordered the Jalapeno poppers. These come served in thier own little shot glasses with ranch/tabasco mix. Very good visually and taste. The seeds are taken out so they are less spicy, and better on the digestion. I recommend these for sure!"}
{"text":"We strongly dislike trying new places, especially when I read a lot of these two star reviews. They ask for your name & number. You will be notified when your table is ready. Sweet. :) Free refills, SIGN UP for the Total Rewards club card.  It was more reasonable than I expected too.  We had 2 American burgers, one without Pickles & mine with tomato & onion. We tried the Truffle Parmesan Fries for $11 ($10 w/ TR card), super addicting. The portions are big, NO JOKE. Save room for dessert, they looked amazing. I did not.  It's just what I expected. I'm a huge fan of Ramsay, and I loved the experience. We will be back since we're locals."}
{"text":"So disappointing!   My friends and I were all looking forward to eating here before seeing a show. One of my gals had already been here once before and said it was very good so we had pretty high expectations. Plus, I love Gordon Ramsay and watch everything and anything that he has done on television.   Luckily, we didn't have to wait for a table because I had a platinum total rewards card. The line was reeeeeally long and to be honest, if we did have to wait I would have been pissed.  Our waitress seemed nice but it was impossible to hear her even though the restaurant wasn't very loud. Throughout our meal she was replaced by several different staff members so it got somewhat confusing. Different people would bring out our food and then other people would get our drinks which made it feel like a disorganized mess.   Food was ok but totally not worth the hype or price tag.   Onions rings - good crunch but very greasy Jalapeno poppers - probably the best thing we had, but I'm pretty sure they forgot our \"fiery surprise\" French fries - decent, but could have used more salt and longer cook time  I had the American burger because I was not feeling very adventurous and I figured it would be the hardest one to screw up.   The bun was good but the burger overall was totally bland. While the cook on the burger was good, the meat did not seem seasoned enough at all. Additionally, there is no condiment on this burger which made for a completely flavorless experience. No fancy ketchup, no \"secret sauce\" aioli, not even a basic mustard. Nothing! You'd think they would want to put something like that on an \"American burger\"..? Or maybe that's just me. While I liked that they used sweet pickles instead of dill, that was about the most stand out thing for me.   My husband felt the same way about his bleu cheese burger. Not enough flavor and just overall extremely unimpressive from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.   We also got the sticky toffee pudding push up pops which were, in short, disgusting.  The cake was extremely dry and crumbly with a flavor reminiscent of burnt molasses rather than nice toffee. The salted peanut ice cream was decent but seemed completely out of place with the other flavor. For me, the two did not meld well at all. I didn't finish mine.   I'm not sure how this place consistently gets lines over 10 people deep, but I definitely won't be back. Super Meh.   I'd sooner return to Stripburger (or even Carl's Jr. for that matter...sorry GR!)"}
{"text":"Burgers here are great. Great quality ingredients along with friendly and attractive staff members (i mean it is vegas, what else would you expect?).  The food tho .... Few problems.... First, why wouldnt you disclose whats in your jalapeno poppers??? Turns out they do put bacon pieces in the poppers. Even the staff didnt know and confirmed that she \"doesnt think so\" well guess what, they did.  The fries came out cold ... thank goodness my burger was great. Unless im craving a burger in vegas and i dont want to go to In-N-Out, ill eat here again."}
{"text":"Mixed review for this meal. Reasonable 25 minute wait on a Saturday at 7 PM. Staff is trained well to handle lines and seating. Appetizers came quickly too. The kitchen does well to keep fast moving apps cooking all the time so there is no waiting for orders. I had the farm burger which had a perfectly cooked over easy fried egg on top. The bun is good quality but was not fresh.  Cloth napkin was not laundered well, had grease stains. Plate inventory is getting old, the logos are wearing off. I had milk shake #5 which is like crack. May be the best milk shake I've ever had. Coffee shake with nutella pudding on top. Seriously good. Without the ridiculously good shake and excellent onion rings the review would have been 3 stars due to the stale bun and dirty napkin. I will go back and try it again though. The sticky pudding push-up desert sounds good. I'll certainly have the same burger. Hopefully the bakery will have just made a delivery."}
{"text":"This place has great food but burgers are the deal! They are the best I've ever had!!! Really! !!! Shakes are really unique and delicious. I dreamed getting back here haha It is always crowdy and you have to make a line so plan your trip here and be patient because it's worth it. :D"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay sure knows how to make a burger. A pricey burger, but a good one nonetheless.   I ordered the farm burger and it was delicious, especially with the egg and duck breast bacon on top. Nice and juicy and medium, just the way I like it.   At the time they had some asian inspired appetizers like bun baos (Chinese steamed buns) and a soba noodle salad. If these are still on their menu, I would skip the salad because it was basically a pile of soggy noodles. The first initial bites were fine, but after a while, it gets a little tiring to eat. The little steam buns were fine. Not very authentic, but good just the same.   The item that you should order is in the name of the restaurant. Go for the burgers. You won't be disappointed! There may be a line to get in, but it goes by pretty quickly actually."}
{"text":"Used to love this place and the food is so good but found a long piece of hair cooked in my burger the food inspector.. Not even the manager..said would you like another?! Then said I'll take it off the bill...  Update: Manager invited us back and the food was great.. no hairs.. Thank you for paying attention to my yelp reviews"}
{"text":"The night started a little rough with the credit card machine declining everyone's cards!  I thought I was going to wash dishes in a Ramsey Restaurant for sure.   Well, they got it fixed and my friend and I sat at the kitchen counter and enjoyed a really good burger and the amazing fries.  The last time I had a meal like this I was at Emeril's in Louisiana."}
{"text":"delicious,  the fries and onion rings are amazing"}
{"text":"I'm usually a plain burger type of guy, but I had an excellent burger.  Mine had a fried egg, but I dont remember the name.  It was excellent.  I will go back next trip."}
{"text":"Service - mediocre, wasn't presented drinks  Menu - not very diverse Jalapeño poppers - cold, not gooey Burger - uninspiring  All in all, Gordon would be displeased and say, \"pathetic!\""}
{"text":"We went on 4/1 and they had just changed the menu the previous day. We had actually looked up reviews on the burgers to decide what to get and then when we got there they were different haha. We had a group of 4 so we had an hour wait, and then another 30 minute wait for our food to come. That was a bit annoying, but it's Vegas, so it's expected. The Parmesan truffle fries are INCREDIBLE. They come with a truffle mayo that is equally incredible and truffle-y. Husband and I both got the farmhouse burger- the one with a fried egg and bacon and oh man, it was good. It was the way a gourmet burger should be. Our friends got burgers that they also really liked. It's a great place, a very casual kind of loud atmosphere, but our server was so nice, and we had a great time overall."}
{"text":"We came in late night, the hostess was very nice and seated us right away, however, that's where all the good ended. We got our drink order 30 minutes after we were seated, all the burgers we ordered were overcooked, unless medium rare means overly done burgers. Also, we got half the food we ordered! And the wait staff was slow, the waiter never came back to check on us and overall it was a terrible experience!"}
{"text":"I had the farm burger and my wife had the American burger and truffle fries. Neither of us cared for the fries and the burgers were just ok. We actually preferred FatBurger, maybe cuz we just like normal burgers. Service was very good though."}
{"text":"We are locals killing some time before a concert prepared to do lots of drinking and eating. They would not seat us until the whole party got there. If they had sat us they would've have made at least $100 in drinks. There was one hostess in particular who was extremely rude and none of them wear name tags. We had to leave without be seated"}
{"text":"The burgers are good, but the beer battered onion rings were awesome.  The shakes were good, and customer service was also good.  The line getting into the restaurant took about 15-20 minutes, as well as it took a while for us to get the food.  This isn't a surprise in Vegas, but in my opinion, I'm not so sure if the food was worth the wait?"}
{"text":"Overall, overrated.  Yes, the patty was cooked perfectly but there was nothing special to the taste of the burger. The truffle fries were too greasy and salty. I expected so much more from the celebrity chef, Gordon Ramsey, who seems to be such a perfectionist in the Hell's kitchen show. The service was good and the shake was good too. But I won't go back to pay $13-16 to get a burger with mediocre taste."}
{"text":"There is a reason to walk into Planet Hollywood now and fortunately, it is just inside the front door, so you don't need to go far. An almost perfect burger, good service (a little slow, this is NOT fast food), The bun is superb as are the french fries. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We're HK/Ramsay fans and have been itching to go to BurGR. We read about the crazy wait times but we went at a good point in the day and only had to entertain ourselves for about 30-40 minutes (in Vegas that isn't hard to do, c'mon people).  I thought I wasn't going to eat much since I had just finished a late breakfast, but 3 glasses of their iced tea later I was starving, not to mention fangirling as Chef Christina, winner of Season 10 was there. I was bouncing around in my seat like an idiot.   Anyway, I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger because I love peppers and avocado. Swallowed that sucker whole. The table ordered both parmesan-truffle and regular fries and they were delicious. We caught a glimpse of the behemoth that was their hot dog. Thing was HUGE.  I bought a glass from the bar and my bf broke it three days later after it survived the trek home. Heartbroken, but it gives me an excuse to go back."}
{"text":"A popular burger restaurant in Las Vegas located inside Planet Hollywood. There is always a lineup outside Gordon Ramsay's Burgr as they don't take reservations. The restaurant is huge and has lots of tables but it is also one of the Gordon's more popular restaurants. Burgers are under $20 so not too bad of a pricepoint for top quality burger. I've dined here a few times and I was back again. This time, I ordered the Hog Burger which has mangalitsa pork, mangalitsa bacon, bbq pork, vintage white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion and slaw. The waiter gave up a heads up that the wait for the food was 45 minutes and considering how busy the restaurant was, it was expected. We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries. The burger was quite delicious and was cooked perfectly. The pork patty was moist and juicy which is just the way I like it. Everyone usually orders the fries which is quite good topped with truffle parmesan, salt and aioli. If you are a big Ramsay fan like I am and enjoy great burgers, this restaurant is the place to be. Our dining experience was quite enjoyable and service was great. My friends and I were quite satisfied and full from dinner. Highly recommend this place when you visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"Nice little casual dining experience inside the Planet Hollywood casino. We sat at the bar due to the long wait for tables. Many beers on tap! I ordered the Batch 19 which was a decent lager. We started off with the chicken wings. The wings were wonderful...tender, melt in your mouth, with a perfect spicy kick with each bite. It tasted like they were infused with bleu cheese which made it a truly perfect bite. We also ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Euro Burger. The Hell's kitchen was decent...the meat seemed to lack a bit of flavor but I did enjoy the flavor of the jalapenos and avocado the burger. The Euro burger was very good (better than the Hell's Kitchen)...the goat cheese was a perfect mix.   If you're in vegas, burgr is a must try..burgers are above average..wings are CRAZY good. 4 stars based on the wings alone."}
{"text":"I'm a big Gordon Ramsey Fan. I was happy   to finally get to  try one of his restaurants. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars. I ordered the burger with the onion jam medium well. The burger was very good and tasty, the bun was soft and the burger held together very well. My problem with the burger it was $16 and it doesn't included fries. If you want French fries its another $8. I also got a coke for $4. With tax it was $32. The burger is good, but not $16 good. The French fries were nothing special at all, they were regular frozen fries that tasted like they were sitting under the heat lamp. I can go spend $12 at five guys or bagger dave's and get a good burger and French fries that are actually good. Bottom line disappointed. I'm still a fan of Gordon Ramsay and I will try his British Pub and Gordon Ramsay Steak next time I go to Las Vegahap"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Bar selection was far less than fantastic.  This place serves up a damned good burger. Nothing absolutely mind-blowing or amazing, but very unique, delicious flavors.   I ordered the uber cheeseburger with a lettuce wrap (no bun). To be honest, the actual taste of the meat was somewhat disappointing. The quality just wasn't that great. But wow,  as soon as I took my first bite beyond the patty and into the land of Uber cheesy-ness, my tastebuds fell in love with Gordon Ramsay. There were three or four different kinds of cheeses, one was goat cheese -- I can't remember the others because I honestly didn't recognize them, but the combination was amazeballs.   My friends all loved their burgers (or Burgrs, is it?) as well. The farm burger had duck bacon and a fried egg -- I came realllllyy close to getting this one but passed it up.The fries were less than spectacular. As in, just meh.   Overall, really great experience, especially for Vegas. They got 12 of us in in under 30 minutes on a Saturday night. It wasn't ridiculously pricey either, at least for vegas -- my burger was about $12-15. Considering how bad and badly overpriced the food is in Vegas is, this place is a must try if you're in town."}
{"text":"Loved the service here, WOW  These girls and guys were on it. The do not wait for your drink to be low, they give you refills without asking. The jalapeno popper were OMG to die for.. they were so damn good. Salivating as I am posting this. The burgers are so delish and yummy and favorable. This is the place."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey! Bloody Hell! This is a burger joint and of the many Gordon Ramsey restaurants in Vegas, I'm guessing that this is the most informal and inexpensive. When you approach the lobby, you will see a live flame through a glass window and the BurGR logo. It is simply gorgeous and we couldn't wait to snap photos nearby. Upon entering, you will notice the atmosphere is casual and welcoming. We noticed that all of the servers and hostesses looked like models. Our server was kind and very helpful with questions regarding the menu.    My husband ordered a specialty burger, off menu, called the Gordon burger and I ordered a Earth burger which is basically a vegetarian sandwich. We enjoyed the food, but didn't feel like it was amazingly special. We split a side of sweet potato fries and also an Oreo cookie shake. It was actually really good and is topped with a vanilla bean pudding. The shake comes with a straw and a spoon and you will need both because it was almost impossible to suck the pudding through the straw. Of all the items ordered at this restaurant, I will say that the shake was the best thing about our meal. Also another tip, long lines develop pretty fast. I recommend going here just when they open around 11am to avoid a long wait, as the restaurant is not very large.   If in Vegas, I may go back again, but I wouldn't necessarily make it a priority. Like most tourists, we really just wanted to try this place because we are Gordon Ramsey fans and figured that it was worth a shot. However, we aren't going to go out of our way in spending approximately $60 for average tasting two sandwiches, one order of fries and one milkshake anytime soon."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS DELICIOUS. BURGER WAS COOKED TO PEREFECTION. The wait time is kind os long after you order and the price is kind of high for a burger joint, but its sooooo good. Recommend hells burger, uber burger, and truffle fries."}
{"text":"Super yummy! The wife and I came to Vegas a couple weeks ago and our meal here was probably our favorite of the trip! The best thing was the truffle parmesan fries... I just couldn't stop eating them! They came with fancy ketchup. No, not the \"fancy ketchup\" you see in packets at Mickey Dee's, this was some legitimate fancy ketchup! It was super good! It also came with truffle aioli which was equally delicious.  We also had the jalapeno poppers, which were great and I loved the presentation, but wish we got some more!! Nonetheless, they were delicious.  I had the Farm Burger, and my wife had the Hog Burger. Both were very good. The Hog Burger was better overall in both of our opinions.. I felt the Farm Burger was a bit dry, although it was still an incredible burger.  The one big negative was how long it took our food to come out. Luckily, we were seated right away but our food took seemingly forever to show up.. So that was disappointing. However, I'm pretty sure next time we are in Vegas we will try to stop here again!"}
{"text":"Very very good.  We got here early but the line was still pretty long. Thanks to a yelp tip we knew to put our make down at the front desk and they sent us a text when our table was ready. In the line we had an hour wait, but we received our text message after only 25 minutes. Thanks yelpers!!  We ordered an American burger, two farm burgers, and one brittania. I had the farm burger and it was pretty good. We were told it is a staff favorite.y sister said the brittania was delicious and my mom said the American was great also. We also had the Parmesan truffle fries but I thought they were just ok, probably because I'm on a diet and I felt guilty eating them lol. We also split an Oreo cookie shake which was excellent.   The service was good. The restaurant has a cool modern feel to it. If you are here give it a try!"}
{"text":"An amazing experience. Awesome food. The ambiance could not be more cool. This place rocks - you have to try it!  I recommend the Uber cheeseburger. Our server Alex was just incredible!  Probably the best service I have had in a very, very long time!   Very well done Gordon  Ramsey!"}
{"text":"Over-hyped. I am totally obsessed with Gordan Ramsay and I was super stoked about trying his burgers. I mostly eat vegetarian, but while I was in Vegas I decided to splurge a little...I'm wishing I hadn't. My partner and I ordered the truffle fries and two burgers to split: The Gordan Burger and The British one. The truffle fries were good and I enjoyed the dipping sauces they came with. The burgers were just OK. I thought the size of the patties should have been bigger. They were a little too thin which made them dry. The British burger had a pleasant sweet, mango sauce, but there wasn't much else to it besides that. The Gordan burger had a homemade salsa on it that I didn't care for at all. Fortunately, we told the waiter we didn't like it and he took it off our ticket. We left with a belly ache, regretting the money we had spent."}
{"text":"The lines are long to eat here at peak hours, and from the Hell's Kitchen-esque decor to the souvenir menu that you're encouraged to take home you never forget that you're eating at a tourist trap.  The burgers themselves? They're okay. You can get as good of a burger at several upscale burger bars on the Strip, and I can think of several better burgers I could get at home. [Go to Houston. Find Bernie's Burger Bus. Thank me later.] They're expensive with fussy ingredients, they're on the dry side, and whatever they decided to top my Hog Burger with just didn't quite work. But we were on vacation and we didn't have to dress up, so I just smiled and watched football with my wife. It all worked out well in the end."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! I can honestly say this is the best place to have the best burger in the valley! (followed closely by Bachi). We were here just this weekend to celebrate my father's birthday and I've been looking forward to my visit here since I first had their sliders and their sticky pudding from Vegas Uncork'd. And they haven't disappointed. We got there around 6pm and there was a line. The hostess took my name and for how many and told us the wait would be about 30min and that they'll shoot us a text message when our table is ready. About 10mins after they sent us a message saying our table is ready. Yay! We were promptly seated and let me just say our server was great. My brother got the Hell's Kitchen burger, my dad had the Chanterelle, my mom the American, and I had the Britannia. All of them were really good and juicy! Perfectly seasoned and cooked. And did I tell you that their TRUFFLE FRIES were to die for?! We had to order two of them cuz my daughter, who's a picky eater, wouldn't share any!! And don't forget to order from their bar! Their antioxidant cocktail was bomb!! I couldn't stop talking about it the next day and would definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Burger is awesome! First off our server \"Alex with the Glasses\" was incredibly friendly and funny! He recommended the Farm Burger which literally blew my mind! The food presentation was incredible. The ticket times were a little long but it was well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Tuesday - without a reservation. The wait was not too long but it is awkward that you wait in a line without checking in.  We were seated after a fifteen minute wait, but only because we elected to sit at the bar. The server/bartender was extremely nice and warned us upfront that the burgers do take about 25-30 minutes to come out, which we appreciated knowing ahead of time but had no problems with. We ordered regular fries as a side (the burgers do not come with anything additional). They were the thick cut steak fries but perfectly crispy and seasoned with salt. They do offer truffle fries as well. I ordered the lobster and shrimp burger and my friends order the hog burger. They were drastically different burgers. Mine was tart with intriguing pickled vegetables. It was definitely worth a shot but will not be something I order if we go again. The Hog Burger, on the other hand, was perfect. There were crispy onions and barbeque pork that contrasted nicely with the pickles.   The environment is a bit loud, since it is right at the entrance to Planet Hollywood off of Las Vegas Blvd.  The bar is close to the entrance and some of the smaller tables are right by the doors in and out of Planet Hollywood. We even had two young boys and the mom (who were not guests of the restaurant) try to come to the bar and sit down to get water, without having waited in line and with a complete disregard for other customers as the boys kicked my seat. The bartender handled it really well. He gave them a to-go cup of water but respectfully advised the mother (who didn't seem very interested in managing her children) that children were not allowed at the bar. They left and I was very impressed with the way the staff handled the situation.   Overall, a good experience and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Although fairly expensive, this is one of the better burgers on the strip. I appreciate that the menu is clearly opinionated about its burgers - no extra condiments are provided (though I suppose you could ask) - and there is a good collection of burgers that you might not find elsewhere. I'd strongly suggest just picking one and not altering it. It might not be what you'd normally order, but you'll get something quite unique and tasty."}
{"text":"I gotta say the burgers were one of the best I've ever had.  Everyone in the family liked their burgers, and loved the onion rings.  We got the onion rings based on other reviews.  Our server was very down to earth and friendly.  It was a great experience."}
{"text":"This is an interesting restaurant. It is located inside the Planet Hollywood hotel. Since it so prominently featured Gordon Ramsay, I thought it would be a little cleaner. Also, the casino smoke comes in all the time, but you can just pretend it is the ash from the window fire display thing. The burgers are very good and so are the onion rings. The staff workers were decent but took away plates prematurely. The TV's suffer from burn in because they are plasma TVs and display the same thing all day long."}
{"text":"Best burger I ever had is the Hell's Kitchen burger here. You have to try it!!! Loved the sweet potato fries too. Fun decor and good service. It's always busy but definitely worth the wait go early to avoid the line."}
{"text":"My amazing husband and I took a fantastic getaway for two vacation to Vegas and as Ramsey fans we HAD to try one of this brands. Of course as a last minute trip we didn't get to his fancier restaurants, but a burger, ahem, burGR would have to do :)  The wait on this particular day was 30 mins, which I have heard is amazing .  Of course if you're an elite diamond member you get to pass the line all together and get first priority. :)  If you have to wait in line...hopefully it's not a sweltering day outside because standing next to a wall of fire is HOT!  Once seated you are presented with an iPad that shows you the desserts and alcoholic beverages. There isn't too much, so you don't get too overwhelmed. You're in, service is fast, and you're stuffed. Everything was amazing and prompt and correct! We even scored extra fries!  The atmosphere is amazing but my only complaint is how close you are to the next table. It's close enough to dare conversations...but still close enough to be too awkward.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered three hamburgers and a couple of sides today to take back to our room at Planet Hollywood.  Our hostess /server Vanessa was RUDE AND SNOBBY.  After waiting 20 minutes we politely asked the status of our order.  Vanessa completely IGNORED us and started talking to the other staff members.  So when we asked again she told us that orders take 30 minutes and it's only been 20 minutes.  She said it with such an unbelievable ATTITUDE and RUDENESS!!! She then proceeded to loud talk with the two other women about us \"Trying her patience\"!  (We are standing in front of you and we can hear you!!!!  ).  Then they started whispering amongst themselves and looking angrily at us as if we did something other than order three hamburgers to go for $68.13 ! We have been Gordon Ramsey fans for a long time and this was our Very FIRST  experience at any of his restaurants.  What an incredibly disappointing experience !!  I guess the hamburgers were good  but honestly we lost our appetite.  We will not go back to GR BURGR.  (Manager see check # 8531327) Management needs to really choose who they put out in front to greet customers!!  They should be personable and friendly ...especially at a restaurant located at Planet Hollywood that caters to so many people from all over the country and world.    CC: guestrelations"}
{"text":"I hate this place so much. Because I live in L.A., and their burgers are so great I never want to have another burger from anywhere else, ever again! I ate dinner there Sunday night before heading home, took two burgers to-go, had one for lunch today at work and the other four dinner tonight! Yeah, that good! Fantastic burgers, and the shakes are out of this world!! Guaranteed this will be the best burger you've ever had in your life. Yeah, I'm THAT sure!  Good value, exquisite cuisine, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Dislike the new branding:((( marketing, Caesars partnership ultimately probably sunk this destination for me.   Waited what felt like forever then 1 of 3 orders didn't show up. Can't really get why according to the manager - \"25 minute ticket time is average\" for a burger? Server was all over the restaurant with a lack of focus.   For a 'Gordon Ramsay' experience I think he'd be despondent if he'd had our night. Without his touch and presence and personal demand for excellence feels like it's got little chance of success.   Bummer:(!"}
{"text":"Possibly our favorite meal in Vegas.  You start waiting in line next to a big window with fire shooting up.  It gets a bit toasty because, you know, FIRE.  Strange.  Our server was really nice.  I enjoyed my Southern yardbird chicken burger.  It came with sharp cheddar cheese, mustard barbeque sauce, pickle and butter lettuce.  It was really well seasoned.  We also ordered the onion rings and they were pretty awesome, though I wish there were more.  It's a bit strange we had to wait for a table, since the restaurant seats 200 and we saw empty tables when we walked around it after our meal."}
{"text":"BurGR was everything we expected and some! The food was exceptional and the service and atmosphere  were right on! We had high expectations  and they were exceeded! Burgers were a little pricey, but worth it.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my husband the Farm burger. Both made to perfection. We ordered truffle fries and they were delicious and enough for 2 to to share. Loved the Chipotle ketchup! Portion sizes were large. Our only disappointment was that we were too stuffed to try dessert!"}
{"text":"Well the wait for this place is ridiculous but I promised the kids they would eat at Gordon Ramsey's, since they're such hell's Kitchen fans.  The service was well not really service they took our order and then took forever to bring us our food. We never really saw our waiter  no apology for the long wait no one came to see if we needed a refill on our drink.  and then our rare burger was brought extra well done.  then we had to wait for a new burger they took it and brought another one back that was it no \" oh I'm sorry about that.  Nothing!\"  So the service sucked!   the burgers were delicious can't deny that,  the bread soft and fluffy and held together nicely  the meat was  juicy and all very tasty.  But the burgers were all that were good.  the chicken wings bland. and the fries and onion rings as busy as they were you would think they'd be fresh and fried to order but they felt as if they had been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour and they were so salty.  and I like well seasoned food I don't usually complain about salt,  but I felt like they were just too salty.   the dessert pudding is ok!    For $200 I spent I was expecting a lot more.  Gordon Ramsey quality food.  and we sat in front of the kitchen and I could see the chaos and confusion going on in there.  they had mixed up tickets orders were coming out wrong the kitchen staff is just as bad as the front of the house staff."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best burger I have ever had. Chanterelle mushrooms + arugula + figgy-onion jam on a sesame seed bun. Never thought that a burger without mayo or cheese was a burger. I was so wrong. Not only yummy, but it feels like it is good for you."}
{"text":"The service and burgers were out-standing! I am giving a 4 for the following. For a $16 burger, you could throw in some fries, it's super loud being right by the main doors of Planet Hollywood, the cheddar ranch dip for the fries tastes like it came out of a tub from Walmart, and my \"medium\" burger was more \"medium rare.\" Over-all though, unique and almost decadent burgers."}
{"text":"We started with the jalapeño poppers which were spicy.. but very delicious! The dipping sauce was awesome too! I would recommend sharing the fries because they come preety packed! Me and my girl barely finished them. As for the burgers their isnt  much words to describe how delicious they were!! The farm burger definitely hit the spot! Our waiter was very nice and the wait was honestly not that long for us two."}
{"text":"Onion Rings were fantastic.  Truffle French Fries were all right: the truffle flavor ended up on the serving dish but were not detectable on the fries.  We got Chandrelle Burger: the chandrelle mixture was overly sweet and I am not sure the mushrooms were even chandrelles.  The burger itself was the same as all the other fancy burger places serve."}
{"text":"Even though it was busy, we were seated quickly. We were excited to try this place because of Chef Gordon Ramsey of course. The burgers were great, but it wasn't something we've never had before. They use the same buns as this place, Eureka in Fresno. Great service, great staff and great wait time. The food didn't completely floor me because for a restaurant owned by a celebrity, I expected a wow factor and it didn't quite have it for me."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try GR'S burger joint. Hostess was super friendly and we were seated within 15 minutes. Hubby and I ordered the onion rings, truffle fries and the Uber burger.  Onion Rings - not to my liking.  Heavy batter. Crispy. Too heavy to eat before a burger.  Truffle Fries - its okay. thick cut. I noticed a pool of oil at bottom of carrier  (torch like shape) and dumped the rest of the fries on a plate. the fries at the bottom were a bit soggy with oil and we couldn't eat it. For the price, it's not worth it. If you like fries, go simple with just plain salt and dump it out of the torch before they get soggy.  Uber Burger-  it's a good burger with white melted cheeses. The cheeses all meld together and create a great topping for the burger. The burger was juicy as I cut it in half to share. However, maybe because of the type of cheeses, I found myself drinking a lot of water. Wished the burger came with a sauce or an onion jam or toasted bun.  It needed something.  GR , this Burger can Be better. Service- We were sat at a small table for two. The empty onion ring torch was not take away before the burger and fries came. The waiter moved our share plates and we helped to make room for the burger and another torch vessel that held the fries. After dumping out the fries, and consuming the burger, the manager came by. He was very friendly and asked how was our meal. We showed him the pool of oil at the bottom of the torch and the soggy oil fries on the plate. He kindly took it off the check. We also let him know that our water glasses were empty and would like more water and to places take away the empty torch vessels.  Our waiter was very nice, however, he did not come  back for water refills and to take away dishes to make our little table easier and comfortable to eat for us.  Visit again?  Probably not. I could get a delicious burger somewhere else. There are so many choices on the strip."}
{"text":"Came here 2 days ago for dinner . Hostess is a little bit emotionless. Seriously, Gordon needs to put somebody up front who is friendly and smiles a lot. But it's ok. She's not the reason I came to this restaurant. My husband and I ordered Hell's Kitchen burger which came out perfectly (medium). Also we ordered jalapeño poppers which is amazingly delicious. On top of everything, we had a great waiter. Very friendly and attentive. If you wanna eat here , bring your patience. At the end, its all worth it! Love you chef Gordon Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass burgers, milk shakes, spiked lemonade and the best jalapeño poppers I've ever had. So good we ate here twice in our weekend in Vegas. Waiters are cool and helpful, it can get a bit crowded but getting a table wasn't too bad. Ambiance is nice and its never too loud. Burgers themselves are served as described and are amazing. I honestly think this place might have the best chicken burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers!!!i had to go back twice the week i stayed out in Vegas!!! The milkshakes were off the hook..The onion rings were to die for!!!!And the fries!!! Worth the wait not that 20 minutes is a long time for me, but may be for others..."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay didn't let me down.  I had this place bookmarked for awhile and I wanted to know what the hype was about with the burgers.  This place is located inside of Plant Hollywood when we walked up, there was a long line.  That's a good sign that this place is popping and it's good OR there's just a bunch of tourists that wants to try Mr. Ramsay burgers.  Either way my curiosity was heightened.    I came here on a weekday in the afternoon and I waited for about 30 minutes for a table and regardless it was well worth it.  We were greeted by our friendly server, who gave great recommendations and she was so attentive.  We ordered the following:  Truffle Parmesan Fries- hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli -$11. They were good, but nothing mind blowing.    Oreo Shake with Creme Brulee-$9 it was so good. Their shakes are delicious, so rich and creamy.  Euro Burger- truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomato- $16.  My wife had this burger and she's typically not a fan of burgers, but she thoroughly enjoyed it.    Farm Burger- duck breast bacon, cheese and fried egg- $15.  The combination of this burger was delicious.  The meat was juicy and tender and the saltiness of the duck breast bacon complimented the burger. The egg was over easy and gushing out from the burger with every bite.  It was perfection.    Would I come back?! Most definitely to try other burgers and shakes on the menu.  The menu is complimentary if you want to keep it for a souvenir."}
{"text":"There was a short line to get in but it moves very quick. Once you get inside, the menu has excellent options. The burgers are  fantastic. I never tried the duck bacon before so that was an interesting touch. You will need to purchase french fries separately (and they are awesome) but there will be enough for 2-3 people. Defiantly going to go back."}
{"text":"The burger was really just average as were the fries. There has to be better options than this but we didn't have time to explore. I just don't see what the fuss is also about for an expensive ok burger."}
{"text":"The place is total crap. The appetizers - fries and onion rings - were way too oily and did not feel freshly made. The veggie burger was so bad one of my friends had to send it back and our chicken and hells kitchen burger were just blah.."}
{"text":"Ok, my company put in a roach trap of a hotel, it's the former Hilton but you can read more about that in thier review.  I spent 10 hours on my feet to day at a teade show, my coworker ditched me and I had to cover our booth by myself. Then at 5 o'clock my boss calls bitch'n about a pain in the ass customer that I can't get any help with.  So back to the hotel for a cold shower and out to dinner   What could make a crappie day better for a foodie, being seat at the kitchen bar at Gordon Ramsay's Burgr.  Food was great, service even better, and the view, well what can I say WOW!"}
{"text":"Let's start with the bad points first. 1. Ok, now the bad is out of the way, onto the good!!!!! Holy cow, that is good food!! The service outstanding but the food is amazing. The Gordon burger was probably the best burger I have eaten in my life. The fries with curry ketchup.......OMG!!!! The onion rings are not your regular deep fat onion rings that leaves oil running down your arms! The chips were amazing. The cocktails and even the darn water tasted good. AMAZING! The only thing that would have made it better was to meet the man himself......outstanding."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 9, the patron was nice and put us in two tables next to each other to minimize our wait time.   I had the Chanterelle Burger which consisted of chanterelle mushroom, argula and figgy onion jam. The burger was on the sweeter side due to the jam but oh my gosh, it's finger-licking good! I also took a few bites off my boyfriend's Farm Burger, which I actually recommend!! Duck breast bacon, fried egg and cheddar...you can't go wrong with this. Also, I order my burger well done, yet it was still really moist and delicious!   To wash these all down, order a shake! The shake is super thick and creamy...like super creamy! No lumpy ice, no chunky ice cream...just thick, creamy and huge in a delicoius way!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed. I got the farm burger and it tasted like any ol burger. Truffle fries were good! But they are just as good at the yard house down the street from my home. I expected a bit more out of this place. :("}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you because these are not some Michelin starred burgers. I don't think the burgers are bad. In fact, I think they are somewhat decent, but just a bit overpriced and overhyped.  Farm burger (3/5) - Perfectly toasted buns, the egg is very nice, but the patty is a bit bland for me. I also think the patty could use a bit more fat but that's just personal preference.  Truffle burger (4/5) - Really good for the first few bites. Rich, unctuous, and extremely aromatic (because of the truffle). Unfortunately the burger is a bit too rich with nothing to offset it. Near the end of your burger your palate would start to feel uncomfortable.  Onion rings (5/5) - A must order. Crunchy skin on the outside with juicy caramelized onions in the middle. This by itself is worth the visit.  If I come back here again, it will be for the onion rings."}
{"text":"I'm a burger fan, especially of higher end burgers.  We came here for dinner on our first night in Vegas.  The wait wasn't too bad, I think it was about 30 minutes.  There's no reservations, you have to put your name on the list and wait for them to call you.    I asked the waiter what he recommended, and he said that the farm burger was really good.  The farm burger consists of duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar cheese and an fried egg on top.  The burger was juicy and all the flavors combined tasted so good!  We also got an order of the truffle parmesan fries AND the sweet potato fries to share with our group.  The truffle parmesan fries was good and salty and the sweet potato fries were sweet, so it was a nice balance of both sweet & salty.    Service was good.  If you sign up for the Total Rewards program, you get special discounted pricing ($1 off mostly everything).  I didn't sign up, but my friend did, so we were all able to enjoy the discount.  I would definitely come back here again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"If I could meet the great Gordon Ramsay in person, I would tell him exactly that he sure outdid himself with his famous gourmet burgers. Some might say that it is all hype. I say the same...but when I say it, it is because it is all positive hype. So far, this has been one of my most memorable experiences as far as burgers go. I can definitely rank this one as Top 3 of all time!  Located right inside Planet Hollywood on the Strip of Las Vegas, Gordon Ramsay BurGR boasts quite the menu. From the get go, you have to wait in the often long line outside. It does move fairly quickly. I only waited approximately 20 min to get seated. They do have a touch screen menu before you get in so you can decide what it is you will be chowing down on. They also have items you can purchase, such as shirts, hats and Gordon Ramsay's book!  Myself and my foodie +1 date came here right a day after all the EDC debauchery that we had just finished going through! I had this place bookmarked for such a long time that I just had to once and try it once the opportunity arose. Soon as we were sat down, we already knew what it was we wanted. For appetizers, we had their beer battered Maui onion rings, which comes with two dipping sauces, chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch. For drinks, my +1 had their lemonade. Not too sweet but made just right. For myself, I had their Brooklyn lager. Smooth as it goes down. By the way, they have a killer beer selection on tap. As for the main course....I cant wait!!! My +1 had their blue burger and added an egg and bacon inside. The bleu cheese just gave it this amazing taste that I almost finished hers! There were so many choices as to which burger for myself to get, but eventually settled for their Hells Kitchen burger. With a bit of a spicy kick and smothered in avocado, this burger was just amazing to admire but yet went down deliciously. Soon as we was done with the onion rings, we had their truffle parmesan fries. The fries lacked somewhat of flavor, but nonetheless, was just as tasty.   Inside there is plenty of seating with quite a few booths. We didn't get lucky with that but I didn't care. I was just anxious about trying this place. The menu itself has Gordon Ramsay's face on it! There are TV's everywhere to enjoy. Once your check is brought, there is an iPod that has a survey that you can fill out regarding your experience. I loved it all! You may think that I am over hyping Gordon Ramsay BurGR. That is fine. Try this place for yourself and see what you think of it. This is one place I am definitely coming back to when I hit the Las Vegas Strip. I am gonna say this once again....Gordon Ramsay, you sure as hell outdid yourself!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite burger place! Been here pretty much every time we make a trip out to Las Vegas. The nice thing is that if it's busy, you can leave your phone number, and they will text you when your table is ready. The Hell's Kitchen, and the Blue Cheese burger are both very fresh and tasty. The burgers are a good size and is never too greasy which I hate. Then we would always get the truffle fries which is delicious with their duo dipping sauce. Overall, a delicious Ramsay restaurant that won't cost you $$$$!"}
{"text":"Good budget good fries great drinks.  Chef Ramsay makes a good burger.  I would go back"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fine service. My group ordered 2 burgers, I ordered a salad. The burgers were tall and looked great. My salad was delicious as well, great variety of cherry tomatoes. However, I did err in not asking for dressing on the side, the whole thing was soaked! I'll keep that in mind for next time...Ambiance is classy and peaceful, with views of the bar and large TVs from the tables. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the Cosmopolitan. I arrived on a Saturday night close to midnight. They closed at 2 am, but my wait for a party of two was still 20 minutes. If you had a party of 3+, you had to check with the hostess and wait was at least 30 minutes.  As of March 27, 2017, self parking here is free. The restaurant doesn't have restrooms, but they're just outside close to the hotel entrance. You have to leave the restaurant and then come back in.   Conveniently, there was a scroll down menu while we were waiting in line. The actual menu once you are seated was pretty neat. It featured Gordon's face on it, fit neatly on the napkin, and opened up with the menu inside. The hostess and server were friendly; I have no complaints on their service.  I guess they were busy because our drinks took a while and the food took even longer.  I opted for the fries and onion rings to be brought out with the burger, but the burgers came out first.   I had the Euro burger, which featured arugula and tomato.  The patty was perfectly medium rare and a generous size.  The garlic aioli was definitely there; they are pretty generous with their flavors.  The truffle fries were not what I expected - I thought they'd be shoestring fries. Instead they were hard, dry steak fries and were only edible with their chipotle ketchup.  The onion rings were better.  My eating partner had a Gordon burger, which was not on the menu.  He enjoyed the turkey bacon, but I don't think it was worth $21.   Will I be back? Yep, it was nice to try for a first time, and it's casual enough where you don't have to dress to impress.  I haven't been to Gordon's three other restaurants in Vegas, so I look forward to trying those in the future!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. These burgers certainly lived up to the hype. My boyfriend and I shared onion rings to start off the meal. The breading was a little thick for my liking but they were super crispy and fresh out of the fryer. I loved the freshly grated Parmesan on top and the cheesy ranch dipping sauce was tasty. Now the burgers. My boyfriend and I shared the Hell's Kitchen burger and the farm burger. We got both medium rare, which we had never had before. The meat was a bit softer than we had expected but well seasoned and the most flavorful patties I've ever tasted. Next time we would probably get them medium well or well done for texture. I loved the Hell's Kitchen burger which had a slice of avocado, melted white cheese, roasted peppers and tomato, which I thought was a perfect combination. The roasted peppers and tomato gave a great flavor and juicy freshness which made the burger seem a bit lighter. The farm burger was also superb. I loved the egg on top but the duck bacon could have been crispier. The only thing missing on this decadent burger was some crisp lettuce which would have definitely helped balance the rich flavors. The buns was also buttery and delicious. Next time we come to Vegas we'll definitely try one of the dawgs, which we saw someone else get and looked really good, as well as one of those gigantic shakes!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to go to in Vegas for a burger. Love the onion rings and the toffee pops!"}
{"text":"Celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.!!! Today is Saturday 1:20pm. The wait line is long, we waited about 40 minutes in line. We had to try Gordon Ramsay burger! Worth the wait!! Yelpers gave great review so we had to try Gordon Ramsey's burger! We ordered the hog burger, the classic american, the famous truffles fries, sweet potato fries, and sticky toffee pudding push pops. OMG! It was the best burger meal we ever had! Cooked perfectly. The dessert made me feel like a child again! Nostalgic feeling! Everything delicious!! Great service!! On our bill there is an iphone attached to the bill to do a survey."}
{"text":"The FARM BURGER was seriously average, nothing to rave about.   Go for the CHILI HOTDOG instead!  The MAUI ONION RINGS are a must!"}
{"text":"A burger joint that GR himself would approve of. Get it...GR? (BurGR)  Anyway, service was 5-star quality, atmosphere was really nice, and the food was totally worth the price, which ended up being like $25 for sharing three sides + burger with four people.   Jalapeno poppers are a must get. Fries are onion rings are strong as well. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was RAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.   Jk. It was very delicious, tender, and perfectly medium rare. A prime burger.   Would love to try a shake but it's $9 :(.   I will be back."}
{"text":"We were warned about long lines and so we went early.  Food was really good and our server was very pleasant and attentive.  Ordered the Blue burger and the American burger with truffle fries.  Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I always passed Burgr when I was at Planet Hollywood and I finally was able to go for my birthday lunch! The burgers are all different tastes and flavors and are amazing. Hands down, the best gourmet burgers I've ever had. The patties are thick and juicy, and the fries and dipping sauces are unique and tasty. I had the burger that had mango chutney and it was so amazing. The mango and lettuce all blended together for a perfect pair. My table got many different things as well and everyone agreed it was perfect. I love this restaraunt."}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had! The line wasn't too bad when we went at 11 pm on a Saturday night. We waited for like 20 minutes or so. We ordered the truffle burger, farm burger, truffle fries and a shake. I highly recommend both burgers cause they were both amazing! The truffle burger had a little bit of a tang to it. Would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Great selection of char-broiled burgers in Vegas. Also, the shakes were rich , thick with flavorful Toppings. Lines were long at dinner time, but  If you have a Total Rewards Platinum card, you can even seated in a shorter line. Fried onion rings were also superb with the right amount of crispness and served on a paper come for all of us to try with our meals."}
{"text":"It was the best response that any server can have to \"What's good here?\" \"I've had everything on the menu, ask me about anything.\" Our server, Alex, nailed it. This spot was damn bustlin. Line going into the casino for groups of 2. Our group of 8 would be on-call for 2 hours, but really thankfully they give that option. Sometime into our meal, cell phones were held up and crowds starting forming....Gordon Ramsey just got seated into a booth right by us. There's something positive about a Chef that eats his own food.  -=-Farm Burger-=- Wasn't too crazy about the name \"Farm Burger,\" but all the ingredients were right. Runny egg yolk in a burger, that's my jam. First thing I did was crack that yolk open and spread it evenly onto the patty. We don't want no gushers here midmeal. Wasn't too crazy about the duck bacon which salted up the burger quite a bit. Otherwise, patty and brioche bun was great. A medium rare was conservatively cooked on the grill but no biggie since it tasted great. Enjoyed this burger to the last bite.  -=-Truffle Fries-=- Winner for fries, but well, one could hope a little bit more truffliness can be added. Steak cut. The 2 dips were good: an aioli and curry ketchup. Good filler at best. Could have been regular fries and wouldn't have mattered.  -=- Jalapeno Poppers-=- Fancy serving dish, and great for an appetizer. Cheese gushing out in every bite. If you've had Jack-in-the-Box's version, then you've already had this dish."}
{"text":"It was alright; a little overrated, but the food was just OK.   The service was exceptional, however! Loved the atmosphere created in their from their uniforms to how they all interacted with us. Our server was very attentive and a TON of fun. The hostess was very accommodating despite how crazy busy they were. The manager even swung by to say hello and see how we were doing, which was cool.  I was just a little bit disappointed by the lack of menu options and some of the burger combinations. I was anticipating menu options other than burgers, in addition to the appetizers that they had. We split the Parmesan fries and the hummus. I will say, the hummus was REALLY great... it's salt and vinegar hummus! Served with some super yummy toasted veggies that had a great crispy crunch and seasoning to them.  Our burger presentation was fabulous, but the taste was just ok. The hummus really took the cake on this meal! I finished up with a creme brulee pudding oreo shake! It was pretty awesome, but rich enough for all three of us to share."}
{"text":"Update 8/26 - quick service and GREAT, cheesy, tasty food.  Burgers are made fresh and waiter told us about that expected wait."}
{"text":"After going to BuGR I have to say Gordon Ramsey would not approve my service. Despite waiting almost two hours to get seated, we had to wait another hour for the food to arrive at our table. Don't get me wrong our waitress was really sweet and brought our drinks in no time. But we waited a long time to get our food. I ordered a Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was amazing the meat was cooked just how I liked it. Apart from the burger we ordered Parmesan fries, according to the recent reviews the fries were amazing but ours not so much. The fries we received were kind of cold and tasted old. Overall I would eat her again but next time make a reservation in advance, and get jalapeño poppers instead."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Gordon Ramsay's . Hells Kitchen and his other programs are very entertaining to me . So when I found out Gordon Ramsay BurGR was located in the Planet Hollywood it was a natural for Dinner .  I rolled there with a Sidekick we waited in line for about 20 minutes . We were then seated at the Counter . Our Server was very Friendly and Attractive. She left us Menus to peruse.  I ordered Truffle Fries,Honey Bao Bao, Chocolate Pudding Shake ,Duck Bacon Farm Fresh Burger and Onion Rings.  My Companion ordered  Truffle fries , Honey Bao Bao,Chocolate Pudding Shake, Bleu Cheese Burger,and Onion Rings.  First Out was the Truffle Fries and the Shakes. Both were very good and tasty. Next out was the Honey Bao Bao -This was a Show Stopper Ultra Yummy  Pork Belly in Hoison Sauce in a Steamed Bun Yum. This is a must order. Out next was my Duck Bacon Burger with a Sunny Side Up Farm Fresh Egg Topping  the Burger . Omg probably one of the best burgers Ive ever had. Very Good and Earthy. Last but not least the Onion Rings very good also.  I paid by Discover Card and Rolled out.  Gordon Ramsay BurGR is a definite must Eat at it lives up to its Name."}
{"text":"I have to start by saying I am a HUGE Gordon Ramsey fan. I have watched his shows and I even play the Gordon Ramsey DASH game...like I play the game everyday it's awesome. I'm addicted. Anyways, if you play the game or have watched his shows you would understand me wanting to come check his burger joint out. As soon as I walk in I am amazed at the fire wall. It's huge and I feel like I am on the show about to sit in one of the VIP sections. The staff is all very nice and welcoming and i decide to sit at the bar seating in the kitchen. It was great! The menu is a folded contraption and when unfolded all of the yummy food options are presented. My guy and I both ordered burgers. It took some time to arrive but I have to say that kitchen runs like a well oiled machine. I saw food being cooked and prepared constantly, food get assessed thoroughly and then being sent out! While I wait on my food I decide to make conversation with the one of the kitchen managers. I quiz him on Gordon and ask does he come there often. He explains to me that he shows up at least once a month and is a pretty good guy to work for. I noticed all the staff impeccably dressed and everything running smoothly. When my burger arrives I can't help but the stare at its perfection before completely devouring it in one inhale. It was so good I had to stop myself so it would last a while and I could savor every mouthful. These melt in your mouth burgers are amazing. I can't wait to go back to Vegas and explore more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent experience here server was nice we received are food extremely fast. My fiancé and I ordered the poppers which were really good. Was told it was like a roulette one was full of seeds either one wasn't or I'm just so used to eating jalapeños with seeds but still really good. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger really good idk what the previous reviewer was saying that it was too hot for her boyfriend with the peppers it was a walk in the parks. My fiancé ordered the uber and she loved it all around amazing fast service and delicious food. Forgot to mention Hilary was a great server very interactive with us. I will recommend and I will visit again"}
{"text":"I was dying to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  So naturally when I saw the flaming sign from across the casino, I had to jump at the chance!  My friend and I decided to come here around 11pm after the Britney Spears 'Piece of Me' concert.  It was packed.  35 minute wait for a table.  Wow.  Must be delicious!  After we are seated, we become familiar with the menu and quickly made our selections.  The process of ordering a drink is rather odd and inconvenient.  The waiter brings over an iPad and scrolls through every drink, explaining what it is in and then leaves you with it to make your selection.  When he returns, he ignores what was put into the iPad and just asks what we want to drink and writes it down...  He made some recommendations for the burGRs and we placed our order.  .....Bueller?  Bueller?  I mean... Waiter?  Waiter?  Where is the food? Unfortunately the wait for our two burGRs was over a half hour.  They must be butchering my cow to order out there... geesh.  The food however, was delicious and cooked to perfection.  This place would EASILY earn 5 stars from me if the service was just a tad bit better.  Servers need to be a bit more attentive, I noticed the same aggravation at the tables around me.  As much as I enjoyed my burGR - I don't know that I'd choose to make a 1.5hr ordeal for it."}
{"text":"Wow! Love love! Absolutely amazing.  It stands up to Gordon Ramsey's standard.  The burger came out a perfect medium, juicy and flavorful without the taste of MSG.  At first you won't think the burger is expensive at average $15 each, then you add the fries to share, it comes out to be $20 burger.  Thou it is still worth it!  We had the Parmesan truffle fries, a bit salty for my taste but the kids and hubby loves it.  We would want to come back again before we leave Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Since we tried all Ramsay's restaurants at Vegas, I would say food here is much better than his Pub & Grill but no comparison to his Steakhouse at Paris Casino!   Location (4/5): This restaurant locates near the upstairs entrance of Planet Hollywood Casino and Hotel. There is one down side - the long line!!! It is decent during lunch time, but mannnnnn it can take forever during dinner time!   Service (4/5): Our waitor was nice and checked in on us from time to time. He was indeed knowledgeable about the menu, and suggested us to try all the popular items on the menu.   Food (3.5/5): We ordered their famous dishes such as the Shake #4 (oreo and toffee shake), truffle oil fries, American burger and the standard dawg aka hot dog. The shake was our favorite of the whole brunch experience! You can taste a little bit of toffee crystal pieces in the shake along with the well-blended oreo shake. The fries were thick-cut fries! I wished they were thin and crispy, then that would be mindblowing. We added bacon to their original American burger. Was it a good burger?? Yah but no wow factor. The standard dawg was indeed standard with the typical pickles, ketchup, mustard and hot dog. The bun, however, was full with toasted black sesame seeds. The wow factor here was how big the dawg was... You can feed two people easily with this hot dog!!!   I would come back if I happen to walk by Planet Hollywood, or treat my friends out for something Ramsay-related. As for the satisfaction level, I expected more!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out yesterday for a friend's birthday. Definitely the best burger and fries I've ever had. I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger & Sweet Potato Fries. Just a little pricey, but what do you expect? It's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. Good food, great atmosphere. Worth the wait & the money!"}
{"text":"It was fantastic I really loved the burger and he didn't come out and yell and cuss at me hahaha!  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This place wasn't as good as I thought it would have been. The burgers were alright. Nothing wrong with them except they cooked mine medium instead of med rare. I expected more though with a restaurant with Gordon Ramsays name on it. All in all I'm glad I went for the experience, but it is quite pricey. Two burgers, two margheritas and an appetizer of Jalepeno poppers cost 90$ before tip."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for BurGR being that is one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, and they surpassed each and every expectation! The burger was cooked to absolute perfection and each ingredient was so incredibly fresh. Definitely in the top 3 of best burgers I ever had. The service was also outstanding - I sat at the bar but the bartender was fast, friendly and efficient. I could not have asked for a better lunch during my first day in Vegas.   I would definitely recommend visiting this restaurant. Gordon did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Ultimately disappointing considering the name involved, although the fire display at the front is very cool. The best part of the meal was easily the banana shake. The burger choices looked fun on paper but were ultimately bland. At least the meat was of good quality. The fries were soggy and needed more seasoning and the service left something to be desired."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place!  Sat at the bar twice and received out of this world service from John and also Mark!  A big thank you to both of them!  The hamburger is quite tasty, however, the hot dog is even better!  Who would think?  The rolls are made right there, with black and white sesame seeds.  Hot dogs are sauteed, steamed and then grilled over apple wood chips.  The hummus is the best I have ever had accompanied by the most delicious fresh veggies (radishes, scallions and carrots).  I had to ask for extra the second visit!  The shakes are good, but filling, as there is a layer of pudding in the shakes.  Our new favorite place and our new favorite bar keeps/waiters John and Mark!"}
{"text":"If you really love Applebee's, you're going to LOVE BurGR. If you want a real burger made with quality ingredients, run away. The patty was your basic frozen patty with very little flavor. The bun had a very stale texture, and the fries were subpar. I'll admit that it wasn't so bad that I felt the desire to spit it out, but I felt like I had wasted my money knowing all the other amazing places we had experienced while visiting Las Vegas. The service was terrible and slow and the ambiance was that of Buffalo Wild Wings except double the cost.   The one thing I found most bizarre was the uniforms for women. This was a restaurant that marketed itself as a gourmet burger establishment. What we found instead was a place that was trying to compete with Hooters. The waitresses were dressed in skin tight mini dresses, while the men were allowed to wear comfortable polo shirts with the restaurant logo. I expect this at Twin Peaks, Tilted Kilt, or Hooters, but in this restaurant it felt really inappropriate. The waitresses appeared very uncomfortable and seemed to be spending a significant amount of time adjusting their uniform. I was very surprised and disappointed to see that Gordon Ramsay would associate his name with this establishment."}
{"text":"I was on vacation a week ago in vegas and ate at a wide variety of places. As a fan of Ramsey I had to stop by here. It was awesome!   I had the Hog Burger. I wanted to try something different and instead of beef this was made of Mangalitsa Pork, so good!"}
{"text":"I love burgers. I had the Farm burger. Egg, duck bacon, cheddar. 90 min wait was ok to try one of Ramsay's  creations. The not so friendly or knowledgeable waitress informed us they were out of duck bacon, they will sub turkey bacon. Dud! Turkey bacon is so common. The smoke flavoring on the burger was delightful. No doubt this is now my favorite burger place in Vegas. Just delish. Try the sticky toffee push up for dessert as well. Yummy."}
{"text":"I had a Ramsey trifecta in thr beginning of April in Vegas, three Gordon Ramsey resturants in the week. I have been to Burgr three times at this point and can tell you that I still compare all other gourmet burger establishments to this one. Again great staff, excellent atmosphere,  and of course the burgers are the star!  If this is your first time to a Ramsey restaurant I say start here if you are in Vegas. Excellent beers on tap to quench everyones thirst!"}
{"text":"I honestly don't think the burger was all that good however the chicken wings and fries here are great! The service could have been better but it was alright since this place is always busy."}
{"text":"Wow!  What a fun dining experience!  Our meal was top notch. From the moment we walked in until the moment we left everyone we dealt with was upbeat and friendly. Our server, Sabrina, was knowledgeable  and  friendly, and made some great menu recommendations when asked. The entire wait staff was very attentive and friendly. I never saw the bottom of my glass . . . a big plus for me. I ordered the Britannia burger. It was cooked perfectly and presented beautifully with a nicely toasted bun. I have to say the attention to detail in the construction of the burger was impressive. This burger had a mango chutney, which I was worried would be messy. The placement of all the ingredients was tight and precise, leading to a delicious and non'-messy burger eating experience. My husband ordered the Blue Burger, which we both liked even better. The blue cheese seemed to be cooked into the meat, and it had a fabulously zing flavor. We shared sweet potato fries. The portions are huge on all the fries. They were served hot and crispy with an aioli dipping sauce and vanilla powdered sugar. They were fabulous. To top it all off, we finished with an Oreo shake. Wow! The shake itself was so flavorful . . . like drinking an Oreo. The top 1/4 if the very tall glass was filled with creme brûlée. Decadent and delicious.  Just a note, the shake was served with a very large straw. It was probably almost 1/2\" across. it made sipping the shake a breeze. It was just one of the many little well thought out details that made eating at BurGR a real treat. I hope to return before we leave Vegas."}
{"text":"I like the place, it's very nice but for the price of the burgers, it's a little over priced for the size. They can keep the price but make the burgers a little more bigger. The ambiance is perfect for being a burger place."}
{"text":"This was a bucket list visit and I was not disappointed at all! We started with Bloody Marys that were nice and spicy. We had heard about the Parmesan truffle fries, so we ordered those, but could not ignore the Gooey Fries on the menu as well, so we got both. The Gooey Fries are one of the best things I've ever had in my life. White cheddar, chives, and salami?! My God. The only tiny thing is that the fries were grainy on the inside. But it honestly didn't matter, the toppings were so delicious. I ordered the Farm Burger that had duck bacon and a fried egg in top, it was glorious. The only suggestion I'd make here is that for me, a burger needs some kind of acid, and this had none, so I ended up dipping it in ketchup. But it was still amazing. My dining partner had the American Burger and loved it except that there were sweet pickles and that's just a big fat NOOOO in our world. But honestly, those are our personal tastes and this was an amazing experience. I only wish we could have finished our food, it's SO much!  Our waitress Nadine was terrific, so friendly and pretty and helpful. The ambiance is spectacular with the giant fire wall. It's very loud, but most restaurants in Vegas are. But it was a blast and the highlight of our day. Kudos to Chef Ramsay and the people who run Burgr!!"}
{"text":"One of the better burgers I've had. Service and atmosphere is great, and burgers are fresh, juicy, and tasty.   The Farm burger and Hell's Kitchen Burger as well as the truffle fries are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been dying to go to this place ever since I moved to Vegas. I love Gordon Ramsey! The reason I hadn't gone sooner was the line. There's ALWAYS a line! However I had tickets to a museum close to the strip and needed to eat beforehand so I met up with some friends here at 11:10. The place opens at 11 so the tiny line there was moved quickly. I think we waited literally a minute.  The drink menu is on an IPad which is ok I guess, didn't really see the point. I ordered a jalapeño Rita to start with. It took awhile for the drinks to come out I would say probably ten minutes for each one. I wasn't in any rush not to mention the company was good so it didn't bother me much but I could see how someone might get annoyed by the slow service.  We ordered jalapeño poppers to start, unfortunately our request for ALL of the jalapeño poppers to be super spicy was denied (boo) so I had to settle for the roulette. My fiancé ended up getting the spiciest one (lucky guy!) but my god they were all tasty. Best jalapeño popper I ever had.  My fiancé and I shared the chili dog and Hell's Kitchen Burger for lunch. I was expecting the burger to be spicy and it wasn't. It was so delicious though! Whatever seasoning was used in the meat was perfect, I could have just eaten the burger patty and been satisfied. The chili dog was also good too but it was HUGE and messy.  My friend let me try some of her regular fries which were good. They came with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup, both were amazing. I'm not sure I can go back to regular ketchup ever again. I seriously considered asking the waiter how I could go about buying a bottle. I seriously would eat it with everything!  All in all I think it took about two hours from the time we sat down until we got our change to eat which is a little more time than I usually spend in a restaurant. As stated earlier though I was with friends and catching up was nice. It is quite loud inside too so I had to almost yell to have a conversation but the tables are far enough away that you don't hear your neighbors conversation.  I would definitely come back, I saw some onion rings going around that looked absolutely divine!"}
{"text":"Delicious.   Farm Burger was awesome. But be careful with the egg. I cut my burger in half and the yolk squirted out onto my phone. Make sure it doesn't get on your clothes or elsewhere.   Hog burger was good. The apple butter was subtle.   The butterscotch milkshake was amazing as well. All the flavored were very well paired. Just make sure you like banana and butterscotch. The butterscotch had a rich malty caramel flavor to it.   Jalapeño poppers are a must. Love the presentation in the shot glasses. Taste was spectacular.   Service was fantastic.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place out. My first impression based on my experiences with the hostesses was toxic. They did not seem to have much personality or their personalities were very (female dog)Like. They were laughing and smiling against each other but did not want anything to do with the customers in line. This was on a Tuesday night (5/17/2016)   The food however was good. My bud and I had the gooey fries which was super cheesy and salty Because of the cheese and salami. I enjoyed it.   I also had the truffle burger, which was also very good. The bartenders were attentive to my drinks and informative of things going on in city."}
{"text":"The Farm Burger has become my favorite burger here and absolutely ranks among my top favorite gourmet burgers that I've had so far in Vegas and Southern CA! It's served with duck breast bacon (which wasn't oily), English sharp cheddar, & fried egg. Enjoyed it so much that I returned a second time during my most recent trip to Vegas and ordered it again!    They also serve Innis & Gunn Oak Aged Scottish Ale here on tap and it pairs so well with the burger I had! Heard a server at Gordon Ramsay Pub & Grill mention that this beer is Gordon Ramsay's favorite and I'm not surprised.   I've dined here 5 times so far, and service has always been great. Looking forward to my next trip to Vegas to order The Farm Burger again!"}
{"text":"Freaking AMAZING !! this was one of the best burgers I have ever had. I would eat hear again and again. We went in the afternoon around 1pm and we had to wait about 10 min for a seat. The burgers were fresh and good combinations of ingredients for a unique flavor. If you are in the Plant Hollywood area top in"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me well, knows I'm a sucker for Gordon Ramsay. I have dreams of him cursing me out in my own kitchen. My husband thinks I'm demented.  So it's not a surprise we had to come try this place while in Vegas for a couple days. Truthfully, I would've tried all his restaurants there, but hubby had other places in mind. We took our food to go, so can't really speak for the service, except when ordering. We ordered up front with the hostess and received our order in 15 minutes, which was quicker than their estimated 30 minute wait as we were told. Add another 15-20 minute travel time to our timeshare and I was already salivating from the smell of the fries.  I ordered the American Burger because I wasn't feeling too adventurous that night (what?!). It was seasoned and cooked well. Hubby liked his Farm Burger because it was gone in the blink of an eye. The truffle parmesan fries were lovely. He thought it was a little too much truffle parmesan, but I disagree. I wanted more!   Overall, GR did not disappoint, especially since there was a bit of a wait between getting our food and eating it. Not bad, my friend."}
{"text":"The line to get a table here is ALWAYS very long but if you are a Total Rewards Diamond member you will be seated immediately. We waited over 20 minutes for our drinks and then over 40 minutes for our burgers. The burgers were pretty good. The onion rings excellent. Fries not so good, kind of dry and lifeless. What angered me here is twice they seated an adult with a screaming INFANT right next to us TWICE!!  Total cost for 4 burgers, 2 fries, 2 onion rings, 2 beers, 2 specialty drinks $146.00."}
{"text":"I'm a GR fan and this was in my Las Vegas to do list. Maybe it was the hype that I had built up. They didn't disappointed me, but I was expecting more. I think the best thing we ate were the fries with the egg and cheese. It didn't had that WOW factor I had in my mind."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay doesn't disappoint! We ate at his pub and grill as well in Atlantic city and it was delicious! So we decided to give Burger a try. I had the most delicious turkey burger of my life. It was complete white meat, tender, so good. We got the onion rings as well which were amazing! Giving 4 stars though because we waited 40 minutes for our food. I know it's freshly made, but people that sat down after us were served first - I think they forgot about us or lost our ticket. Food was so good though we didn't mind too much! Definitely check out!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Excellent beer selection! Pricey! Always busy, so expect a wait!   BurGR is a different experience than most burger joints. It is definitely a gourmet burger spot where everything comes a la carte. Even thought it is a little pricey, the portions are big, and you feel you are getting a good deal for your money.   Food - When I went there, I ordered the Southern Yardbird burger. You could say I didn't get the \"full experience\" because it was a chicken burger not a beef one. It was huge - about the size of a softball. We also ordered the Truffle Fries which were amazing! They came with this BBQ ketchup that I could have eaten with a spoon.   Atmosphere - Since it is in the middle of the casino, it is pretty loud. If you are looking for a quiet place, I would not recommend it. It is modern and lively, and the servers are very attentive. The chairs and tables are a weird height. You sink into the chairs, and it makes you feel like you have been sucked in. Try to sit at one of the high tables or the bar."}
{"text":"I had the Hells burger medium. I'm usually scared of burgers cooked less than well but the server assured me that their beef was ground fresh daily by a local butcher. 1/3 of my burger was rare so the hubby got that. The taste was great, everything on it added up to a great combination.  We also got the Truffle Parm fries and again the flavor was great but getting many fries that came from bad potatoes was just yucky.  I make home fries all the time and you have to trim the bad spots of the potato off, frying them up like that makes the whole fry tasted muddy.  The price was a bit hard to swallow, $50.00 for 2 cokes, 2 burgers and a shared fry.  I would still go again and again to try each burger.  The servers were also terrific."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. I am a vegetarian and usually can't find a descent burger but the earth burger was amazing.   Our server (tall girl from Hawaii) was really nice. She was patient and checked on the table just enough to give great service. 5 stars overall."}
{"text":"I came here with five of my close friends and family members.(guys Las Vegas night) , and I have to say their burger was the best I have ever had in my life and every one else in my group agrees.  Pricey but worth very penny"}
{"text":"I have love Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen and that's exactly the kind of burger I ordered: Hell's Kitchen burger that has avocado, beef patty and egg! Had raspberry tea on the side with fries! The farmers burger was ordered too which again came with duck Breast bacon! awesome burgers!!! The wait was an hr for us but since we were staying at bellagio it was easy! buzzing restaurant! Just one complaint: the casino's smoke really took away the ambience! It's a great looking restaurant but the smoke got to me after 5 mins of being seated!! Elijah served us and lemme tell u he did a great job! Refills bang on time and checked in twice!! Loved the place and yes would come here again!!"}
{"text":"Kinda overrated aside from the very long wait in line. They do not offer turkey burgers, which is disheartening because some people eat turkey instead of chicken."}
{"text":"Catching a quick lunch before departing for the airport. No wait today, staff very personable. Fast service. Matt was a fantastic waiter   Had the Hog Burger. Highly recommend. Very nice presentation. Prompt.   Prices were very reasonable. Lunch for two was around $40. Nice drink selection.   Would I return? Absolutely."}
{"text":"Dinner on a Sunday nite. Waitress Ashley C was very attentive, courteous, and hospitable. Scene was lively. Sunday Night Football was on their HD flat panels, so we were able to watch and din."}
{"text":"My husband and I liked this place so much that we went back the following night again!  First of all, the ambience and service and presentation was like we would expect and even better.  The first night, we lucked out by accident and got to sit at the kitchen and observe the kitchen staff as though they were on a cooking show or something. Pretty cool.    The beef in the burgers tasted so natural and fresh. They melt in your mouth.  The sesame seed bun is soft but tasteful, unlike some buns that are just dense or tasteless.   The fries are super amazing. I love how they put them in wrapped paper in a metal cone so that it retains the heat for the fries much longer.   The truffled aoili is a common sauce that I recommend everyone to experience.  Even the ketchup isn't order. Definitely homemade with a twist of a couple of other subtle flavors.    On our second night, the manager came by our table to ask how everything was.  We told him \"so good, we came back two nights in a row.\"   We ordered the chili hot dog in the second night. That hot dog must have been a foot long and was definitely all beef!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed great service. I had the Britannia burger which with the sharp cheddar and Mango chutney was great."}
{"text":"The blue cheese burger was amazing. Still craving it 2 days later. No appetizer is needed as the portions are huge.  Go with the onion rings over the fries and be sure to save some room for the pudding shakes.   Great waitstaff, prompt, courteous and all the recommendations were spot on."}
{"text":"Exterior = 5/5: located inside of Planet Hollywood near one of the entrances of the casino, we got lost trying to find it since it looked like it was in Paris Paris on the GPS. The exterior has a really cool fire wall which grabs your attention almost immediately.   Interior = 4/5: it was a nice setting, clean and modern feel. Location is a little on the small side. Choices between booth, tables, bar, or high chair seating. Downside was there is no bathroom inside of the restaurant, however it is right outside in the casino across from the entrance. Noise level was nice even for being in the casino, didn't really notice the entrance or casino the restaurant is between.  Service = 5/5: no complaints on food service. Seating took a while so be ready to wait outside in a line.   Order = 4/5 Truffle fries: good for the first couple pieces then kind of got tired of it. Did offer two different sauces for dipping, one was similar to marinara and the other was aoili. Barely tasted the truffle felt like the garlic over powered the truffle.  Oreo with creme brulee pudding: the concept of the milkshake with pudding was really interesting, it was a good complement to the burgers. Oreo tasted yummy, similar to other milkshakes I have had. But it was unique was the pudding and ice cream combo.  Coffee with chocolate pudding: same comment, unique factor was the pudding on top which gave a nice texture difference between the two desserts. The coffee milkshake tasted like a Hagen daz milkshake, not complaining but I wasn't floored.   Hell's Kitchen Burger: boyfriend ordered this burger and be warned it is spicy because of the pepper inside. If you get bits of it, the spice is manageable but still a little on the spicy side. This is coming from someone who handles spice, so get this burger if you like spice or can handle it. Cooked exactly to what we wanted which was medium rare.   Farm Burger: I love burgers with egg. This burger had egg. Egg wasn't overcooked so that made me enjoy it more. There was also a nice piece of duck bacon to add a bit more saltiness to the burger's flavor. Cooked perfectly to medium rare, something I like to call out since places don't always do that.  Overall = 4.5/5  Hint = burgers look small, but fill you up pretty well. I found myself in a crazy food coma after this meal. They don't offer text notifications like other places, you have to wait in line to be brought into the restaurant for seating, no seating either."}
{"text":"I rarely rate places at five stars but this fun exciting place with top quality food at fair prices is superb. My best buddy, wife, and I had the onion rings Hell's Kitchen and Gordon burger.  They were excellent. Crispy and flavorful without the deep fryer flavor onion rings are definetly wonderful.  The Gordon burger with grid duck bacon and pork is second to none. The Hell's Kitchen burger with the grilled jalapeño has earthy beefy flavor with a bite.  We cook a lot at home and if we can cook it there better than the restaurant it will never get five stars from us. And Gordon has lived up to his rep with us. Highly recommend.  Will return."}
{"text":"Amazing burger! Got the Hells Kitchen and it definitely did not disappoint.  We came in during lunchtime on a Saturday. The queue started about 20 minutes before the place opened. Had no trouble getting a seat, but judging for the line after we got it, expect to wait 10-20 minutes for a seat.  Aside from the burger, also got truffle fries and a melon cocktail. Both were awesome as well! Great place to stop by in Vegas and prices are fairly affordable."}
{"text":"Awesome every time. We ordered the Euro and Uber Burger this time, and we're not disappointed.  Wished we had ordered sweet potato fries, but otherwise excellent, per the usual. And we're locals. Locals know where the good eats are."}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Vegas.  The meat is great, juicy and cooked perfectly.  The buns are the best I've ever had.  I've had the Britannia Burger both times I've been and it is outstanding.  The burger is worth the price tag, but the fries are not.  They are good for sharing, but not if you're by yourself.  And I'm not a fan of their house-spiced ketchups.  The wait isn't too terrible.  And the service is friendly and efficient.  And the waitress outfits are quite nice."}
{"text":"One of the 'hunger stops' on the Strip..... The ambience of the place was WOW, didn't have lot of wait time as it was a week day. Coming to the food, we had the Damnation and Earth Burgers, nicely presented and taste was good, not really out of the world as our expectations were. The onion rings and jalapeno poppers were tasty. On the whole we did feel the place is a bit over-rated, but it was our first experience of a 'Gordon Ramsay' restaurant so we ain't complaining! :) Oh and the location is great, right beside the Miracle Mile Shops."}
{"text":"So me and my family did a burger challenge on our vacation to  vegas.  Wow, poor other burger places...out of 4 places we ate, BurGr didnt even place in the contest. well lucky for one that got 1st only because it was a very good burger compared to the other 2..as for BurGr, it is in a league of its own. We had the Hog burger and WOW, every bite was heavenly..juiciest burger ever, all the ingredients were delicious from the crisp onions to the slaw...effin amazing...my kids even made a song on how delicious it was and would not stop talking about the burger for 2 days...not 1 single complaint..resturaunt was very nice to look at, the staff was friendly and impressively knowledgeable of the menu, food was out of this world..luckily we were immediately seated because we were first there compared to the 1.5hr waits of the previous days..the restraunt packed after about 15 minutes of opening...so if you want to have a truly unique burger experience, i highly recommend this place...great job gordon!"}
{"text":"The food was superb - best hamburger and hot dog, ever! Service and presentation were also outstanding!"}
{"text":"Oh Ramsay we expected the best burger we'd ever had, but honestly we've had plenty better burgers out there at far cheaper prices and without the long one hour wait (longer for bigger parties like ours).  The burgers themselves were just slightly underseasoned, not enough to complain, but not enough to really bring the flavor.  The buns used were too tall making it difficult to eat, and I wasn't a fan of the balance of the burger either.  I had the farm burger (16) and the white truffle fries (11) and a soda (4).  The fries were decent, much better than the plain fries, while the sweet potato fries were a bit too sweet really.  The fries are advertised as big enough to share, but honestly we had a table of 9 people who don't eat that much and we really needed 6 because we finished 5 sets without wasting a breath.  If you have a reasonable appetite you might want to order one just for yourself.  So yeah not a bad burger, but for $31 + tax + tip for a burger/fries/soda combo I'd expect much better.  On the plus side the service was some of the best we've had."}
{"text":"Very good burger! Loved the poppers and the beer selection. The manager was super effective ... A couple times staff congregated in groups and talked/laughing and he gently asked them not to and they stopped or he guided them else where. Our waitress was awesome. Wouldn't go out of my way for it but definitely worth visiting as a necessity to visiting Vegas and GR lover!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. This place definitely didn't live up to its hype nor the name it carries.   Let's start from the beginning: if you're just with another person or just by yourself, you would need to spend the next hour waiting in line, there is now way around it. For parties three or more, they have an awesome text service that will ping you when it's your turn - you will have about ten minutes to get to the hostess before they give your table away. The catch here is that throughout most of Planet Hollywood, where the restaurant is nicely located, the cell reception is horrible. So again, your mobility is limited; I wouldn't try to go inside the mall, just try to hang around near the entrance or by the nearby slots.  The inside decor is appealing, I dig the fire decorations which add to the excitement. The chairs are low, but it sets you at a perfect elbow height for eating a burger; you have to try to see what I mean, but it was a nice touch.  Once we set down, we only got the food menu which had beverages but didn't include alcoholic beverages which were on a separate menu that we didn't get. We asked the waitress and she brought an iPad menu just for selecting the drink. This was rather inconvenient, I didn't get enough time to choose from the iPad while the waitress was waiting to take it back, or so it seemed. Also, not sure if it's wise to have two types of menus: one on a paper and one on an iPad. To be honest, the iPad didn't look that clean or new either, so I was a little hesitant on handling it.  Cleanliness was ok, not great. The little yellow plate holders had marks on them and the tabletops were full of scratch marks. Not that this is a deal breaker, just that I would have expected Gordon to pay attention to these details. I would get rid of the plate holders altogether, they don't add much and look dirty.   We got sweet potato fries and onion rings to go as appetizers with our burgers. Sweet potato fries were mediocre at best, I thought wedges were cut too thin to carry any flavor. We also asked to not add any vanilla sugar powder to it, which comes with it by default, since it didn't really sound appetizing.   The onion rings were horrible. Dare I say, the worst onion rings I have ever had. The extra dough surrounding the rings cooked like break - you could literally break large chunks of what looked like bread dough. It was drenched in oil, just dripping. I did bring this to the attention of the waitress, who was kind enough to get us another serving, but as much as I am happy for having a staff that's open to feedback, I was disappointed that she brought in just another serving of those oily, doughy, tasteless onion rings. Just not acceptable from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  Now come the burgers - I got the Blue Burger, which as the name implies, comes with blue cheese. It was ok, just that, nothing more or less. The bread was a little too tough and tasteless, although the sesame seed sprinkle was a nice touch. The meat was too thick and dry, I did order medium well, but it was mostly on the well side. Not saying it was the worst burger I had, but it was definitely not in my list of best burgers.   I did try a few bites of two other burgers - one came with duck bacon and an egg, called the farm burger, and the other one was called Hell's Kitchen Burger which came with hot peppers. Both were mediocre; not enough distinctive flavor, dry and overly large piece of meat, sandwiched with dry and gummy bread.   The place is also on a pricer side, expect to pay upwards up $30 per person if you're planning to get an appetizer with your burger and a drink. The burger itself doesn't come with any sides, so you probably want to get an appetizer or something to go with your burger. If you read so far, you would know better than to get onion rings."}
{"text":"Based on the good reviews and lines we've seen going into the restaurant, coupled with staying at PH, we decided to try this out for lunch.  This was probably some of the worst burgers we've ever had. In and Out across the way is better worth your money. We started with some sides as apps: wings, onion rings, truffle fries.  If it wasn't for how great the fries/rings tasted, it'd be 1 star. So go for the fries! Several in ou group ordered bloody marys...which all tasted watered down even though they were ordered extra spicy. Couple salads were ordered - very basic. Everyone ordered a burger. Their top 3 recommended were ok. We also ordered the lobster/shrimp burger, and the foie burger. Worst burgers ever.  The lobster/shrimp was so intensely salty it was bitter - couldn't taste anything else except the salt and bitterness. The foie burger - i'm confused why it's calle foie. Where's the foie? All we tasted was bleu cheese. We mentioned to our server Wendy how salty the burger was at the end of the meal. Her response was 'ok i'll be sure to pass on the feedback'. Gave us our check, and that was that. At a Ramsay restaurant, I expect way better service and knowledge on how to handle quality issues - where's the follow up to the feedback? Skip GR Burger's $15-$25 burgers, go to In and Out!"}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were set to the highest standards considering who's name is on this restaurant. Service was good However myself and friends were very disappointed in the quality of the food. The earth burger was my choice with the parmasan truffle fries. My burger had an uneatable sun dried tomato and the fries with an aioli sauce. The fries were like eating sticks of dried sawdust. My friends ordered the yard bird and onion rings. The onion rings which looked as if they had been sitting in an oil soak and were soo greasy that they were sent back I'm not exactly sure to this day what exactly gave us stomach problems but glad to say we all made it to the restroom in a timely manner. immediately.  Needless to say we were not impressed enough to return.   We have had much better tasting food in our local area non iron chef establishments."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Located in Planet Hollywood, my boyfriend & I decided to try the famous BurgR!    There was a line but it went fast.  We got seated at the bar & all the workers were nice & attentive.  We ordered:  Shake #3 = Butterscotch pudding, banana shake, snicker doodle cookie - Good! Shake #4 = Creme Brûlée pudding, Oreo shake, Oreo cookie - Amazing!  Side note about the shakes: the pudding is half of the shake!  We were not sure if we were suppose to mix the pudding & the shake or leave it layered as it was.  The shake portion was great but when we got to the pudding, it was way to thick to even consider drinking.  Personally, I think it would have been better if the pudding portion was a thin layer on the top instead of half the drink!  Truffle Parmesan Fries - Must order!  Thick fries nicely seasoned. Blue Burger - If you like blue cheese, this burger is made for you! Farm Burger - Duck breast bacon.  Feel adventurous, try this."}
{"text":"If you haven't read all the other previous reviews about Gordon Ramsay's BurGr...be prepared for a long wait.  One good thing was you don't necessarily have to stand around and wait in line.  The hostess will text you when your table is ready so our group of 6 gambled away our money while we waited for our text.    Almost 2 hours later, I got a text saying our table was ready.  Starving and filled with great expectations, I looked over the menu.  I decided on getting the Euro burger.  Our group order a couple starters to share amongst the table:  parmesan truffle fries, onion rings, and jalapeno poppers.  All the starters were very tasty.  The onion rings had a great crunch on the batter and truffle aioli that came with the fries was really good.  I even spread it on my burger.  My euro burger was cooked to perfection...medium rare.  While delicious, I felt that it was lacking some flavor.  I was missing that \"WOW\" factor that I was expecting from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  But overall,  everyone in the group really enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"I was definitely really excited to come here, being a pretty avid MasterChef (and other Gordon Ramsey shows) watcher, and I expected some sort of a wait, considering it was Vegas in the summer at dinner time, but luckily our party of 6 only had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated.   Pros:  - I mean, celebrity chef. - Lives up to its \"gourmet burger\" category but also has some other offerings for people who don't want burgers: lots of choices with really interesting ingredients that can cater to almost any flavor craving. (I got the Euro burger - probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Still drooling thinking about the truffle aioli)  - Awesome milkshake choices: forget the vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry milkshakes; the oreo creme brulee milkshake is HANDS DOWN the best milk shake I've ever had. I also feel like I probably drank a week's worth of sugar but... worth it.   Cons:  - Definitely can be really crowded, but most Vegas restaurants are - Price: The food is good... but can I really justify an $8/9 dollar milkshake? And despite how good the burger was, it was a little small for $15."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Best burger I had out in vegas and the drinks were awesome to would deff come back here on my next trip to Vegas"}
{"text":"Well to start with...it's not my first time here. I do like this place a lot cause the burgers are delicious.  B-U-T...!!! The fries...dry...burnt and doesn't justifying the price...for sure cannot stand next to the delicious burgers. Becides, It comes in a huge portion so I would expect a good waitress to recommend sharing...... And on top of this there's no regular mayo and ketchup.... Everything is flavoured which I don't like so much.  Truffle burger and Euro burger are amazing..!!!"}
{"text":"Burgers, salads, fries.., all good! Table for two- wait in line.., 3 or more in your party.., get your name on the list, they'll text you when your table is ready - sounds good. Everyone seemed happy, customers and staff alike. Service was great, food too. We were a 5 top, fresh from the Allstate Forum so our standards were high - we were all satisfied! Happy."}
{"text":"Good job!  Solid wait service, and great food was prepared exactly to order, unlike my discouraging December experience at Ramsay's Pub location in Caeser's Palace.  It was busy tonight, 90 minute wait.  With Total Rewards status, the wait was just a few minutes.  Compliments to the hosts at the front door on the table.  We knew the kitchen was swamped with all the tables full, yet our food was delivered within a reasonable wait, and to order.    They earned a 5 star recommendation tonight."}
{"text":"Hands down the very best Burger Spot I have ever been to in my life!!!!! When you talk about the food that is..  The Service not so much.  The service times here was to me was on the slow side.  With my table they ran what I'm sure was a 20+ ticket time, which dropped them a whole other star.  The service times are  something that with all the focus on service and quality Gordon harps on, was lacking.  But beyond that the food was amazing when it finally did come out.  The queue system in order to be seated was also a first that I have seen and really added to the cool and chic feel that this place was going for.  Definitely will come back,  however I will be expecting to be here for about 45-60 mins once we stand in line until we get the food.  An expectation that I hope they did not meet the next time."}
{"text":"Where do I even begin?!  This place blew our minds, and completely exceeded expectations.  We are pretty skeptical when it comes to gourmet burgers because most places are disappointing, and we usually find ourselves rather eating a cheapo in-n-out burger for a fraction of the gourmet burger prices.  The only gourmet burger place we've ever found worthy was Father's Office, until now.  Gordon Ramsay - you win all the burgers.  My husband got The Farm Burger, and I got the Euro Burger.  We pretty much inhaled our burgers, while stuffing our noses with Truffle fries.  The homemade ketchup, and the truffle aioli that accompanied the fries were mind-blowing too.  You can actually see little bits of truffle pieces in the aioli.  Wow.    My Euro Burger ($16) was composed of truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomato... and you could really taste that truffle.  After I was done eating, I could still taste that lingering truffle in my mouth - mmmmm.... I'm still dreaming about this burger.  My husband was equally satisfied with his Farm Burger ($15), which consisted of duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar, and a fried egg.  Duck breast?  Fried egg?  YES please.  Ramsay is a genius to have come up with that combination.    This was a last minute, spontaneous restaurant choice for us during our recent trip to Vegas, but it turned out to be our best!  Definitely give this place a chance.  So good!"}
{"text":"GREAT burgers! Good service. And it doesn't break the bank! A solid 4 stars all around.   I'm usually skeptical of gourmet burger joints just bc there are sooooo many out there now. A burger is a burger right? Well no not really. And BurGR proves that you can still make a piece of meat between two pieces of bread pretty unique.   Hubby and I tried the place out on a Thursday night about 6pm. We stayed at planet hollywood and every time we go by BurGR There always seems to be a line. But we were told 25 min and it really took us maybe 15 min in line. You can get in faster if you opt for one of the high top tables which are teeny but it'll do. Good view of the TV to catch some of the games.  I got the chanterelle burger which doesn't come with cheese but you can add on. I opted for Fontina cheese which worked great with the arugula, mushrooms and fig jam. My hubby got the farm burger with the fried egg and duck bacon. Wow. I mean. There are no words for that burger. Except maybe crazy delicious. What I like about the burgers are that they're not huge and unmanageable to eat. They fit nicely in the hands and are the perfect portion at least for us.   The truffle Parmesan fries. Very good. Not too truffle-y. We also had the jalepeno poppers which were delicious!! The floor mgr came to check on us and gave us a funny tidbit, that in each batch of poppers there's one where they leave the seeds. apparently  my hubby got that one bc he bit into it and felt like his face was on fire. But the poppers. I highly recommend them. They have bacon inside them, hello!!  To finish off our dinner we got the sticky toffee push pops which were delicious and just the right touch of sweetness to end your meal. Good beer on tap too. A nice solid place to grab a tasty meal and not go broke!! Good service too."}
{"text":"omg where to begin the burgers here are mouth watering. every trip to Vegas I make sure to eat here. but this trip they changed their menu with new burgers to try omg there were too many good ones I wanted to try. I ended up with the forest burger $16 and to start mushroom gravy poutine as an appetizer $15. (shared) omg even that was to die for my friend got the lobster seafood burger $26 and she loved every bit...we sat at the chef's table which was so fun to sit at. it's the bar to watch the kitchen work the chef will talk to you as he works and so will his sous chef we ended up staying late just to watch the chef do his job. Harold (chef) was excellent he recommend our burgers when we had trouble deciding on what burger and to help explain what the heck some of these cheeses were. would definitely sit at the chef's table again. the wait to be seated can be long. the wait for your food will take a bit since it is fresh made to order but it is so worth it you will never want another regular burger again!"}
{"text":"Excellent juicy medium rare American burger.  Can't say it's better than Burger Bar over at Mandalay but it isn't worse.  The crime brûlée topped Oreo milkshake was just too over the top for me.  Pick a lane.  I liked the Oreo milkshake part better than the the crime brûlée flavored pudding.  The truffle fries didn't wow us; prefer thinner cut fries.  Sat at the bar and the servers were great once they got over themselves."}
{"text":"I'm pretty bummed because I've been wanting to try this restaurant for a while but it fell below expectations. First off, the service was complete crap. Most of the staff was fine but our particular server was non-attentive and seemed like he hated his job. Even the random employee that said bye to us as we were walking out was more pleasant than our own server.   Food was A-OK. We got 2 burgers and split the truffle fries. Truffle fries were mediocre, they were cold by the time they got to our table. They tasted like truffle fries that I've had at other restaurants. Our burgers were fine, cooked to our liking. The prices are fair and I like the feel of the restaurant. The line moves fairly quickly too so don't let it deter you if you wanna check it out. I'm not in any rush to come back but I wouldn't mind giving it another shot if someone suggested it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsey so I was very excited to try BurGR. It was about four in the afternoon on a Sunday when my girlfriend and I got to BurGR. There were only a few people in the \"line\". I say \"line\" because there was a rope and there were people inside it but mostly outside it which seemed a bit confused. The hostesses ignored the issue for a couple minutes then finally came and sorted everything out. This was a bit annoying since they were just standing there talking to each other and didn't seem to be doing any actual work. After the line was sorted out they kept trying to push these tiny tables on everyone in line that were on the very edge of the restaurant practically inside the casino. Nobody was interested in sitting there but they sure kept asking people. These tabletops didn't look large enough to even fit food for two. While we stood in line I saw a female trying to buy a BurGR t-shirt. She had to loudly say, \"Excuse me!\" several times before the hostesses would stop their personal conversation and help her. The nearest hostess actually had her back to the line completely ignoring it. At that point the one hostess took the shirt from her and told her to purchase it at the bar and bring back the receipt then they would give her the shirt. They went immediately back to their conversation. It may not sound like much but the hostesses were VERY MUCH into their personal conversation more than helping customers. It was  rude. If I were to grade the restaurant based solely on the hostesses it would be one star.  When we finally got a table the server was fairly quick helping us. We both ordered the signature \"Hell's Kitchen Burger\", hers without the jalapenos. We both ordered soda and it was semi cold like the soda machine was putting out warm soda and the ice wasn't cutting it. Maybe the machine was having issues. Seems like a small thing but it still bothered me.   When we finally got our burgers and onion rings the quality of the food and presentation was very noticeable. It's exactly as I expected it would be. To me, the major downside was my burger seemed bland. I'm not a fan of tomatoes or avocado but I left them on since that's how the burger was meant to be tasted. The avocado (which has never had any flavor for me) completely masked the flavor and heat of the burger. When I finally took the avocado off the burger it finally got some flavor and heat. Even with that I don't think there was enough flavor in the burger. The onion rings were decent but the dipping sauces were great! Finally a plus.   So, two burgers, onion rings to share, and two sodas... just under $50. Too pricey for what I got. In the restaurant's defense, my girlfriend loved the food and it was obvious they used high quality ingredients in everything. Maybe I expected too much with Ramsey's name attached. I would try it again and get something else. Maybe that particular burger wasn't right for me.  I love a good burger and for me, in Vegas, my favorite spot is Stripburger. If anyone reading this is in SoCal try Umami Burger or Slater's 50/50. For my money, those places are far better than BurGR."}
{"text":"I want to start this review by saying that I love Gordon Ramsay! I was so excited to eat here, and it did not disappoint. We had the Blue Burger, and the Chanterelle Burger, as well as the Parmesan Truffle Fries. The fries- OH. MY. GOODNESS. They were so delicious and crispy, and the portions were huge. I would recommend 2 or 3 people share one order of fries. Like I said, the portion was HUGE! And the burgers were the most perfect medium rare. It was delicious. Their beer selection is also great. The service was good. The hostesses were all friendly and helpful. I also thought the prices were on point for being on The Strip, and also it's a Gordon Ramsay restaurant! I was expecting the price to be about $20 a burger, but I was pleasantly surprised. They also give Total Rewards member discounts! Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The staff of infinitely beautiful people makes you feel welcome at this high end burger establishment worthy of the Gordon Ramsay name.  Score a spot at the bar or deal with the long wait for a table, it will be worth your while.  Burgers had good meet to bun ratio, excellent toppings, and a beef blend in my top 3 of all time.  Large beer selection on tap is icing on the cake. Service was especially good, and super friendly, even to an old crank like me.  Raul at the bar was super cool, and special props to Joanne the manager (she spent years in my neighborhood in Washington Heights, so maybe I'm biased).  This restaurant launched itself onto my 'must visit' list in Vegas."}
{"text":"After watching so many episodes of Hell's Kitchen and Master Chef, I am finally here in Gordon Ramsay BurGR! I've been dying to go to this place whenever I am craving for burger. When we arrived at the restaurant, there was already a line. We waited for 30 minutes in the line to get seated which isn't too bad at all. We had this menu with chef Ramsys face and we could take it home.   Food Farm Burger 4 Star This came with came with duck breast bacon, cheddar cheese, and a fried egg. The egg yolk went through the burger when I cut it. The bun was toasted which I appreciated. A lot of burger place serve burgers  in cold bun and that decreased my appetite but this burger bun was def beyond my expectation. The yolk moisturize the burger and made it easier to swallow too.  Fried Jalapeno Poppers 4.5 Star This was delicious! One order came with 6 jalapeno poppers in 6 shot glasses. The bottom of the jalapeno popper was ranch dressing. I love the crispiness of the skin and and spiciness of the jalapeno poppers. This dish was definitely impressive. I would order this again.  Beer Battered Onion Rings 3 Star This was my least favorite dish. Those rings are huge but when I took a bite, the portion of onion was not that huge. It was mostly batter. Also this was a little too greasy. I barely tasted the onion flavor.  Truffle Fries 4.5 Star This was my favorite of the day. The fries were crispy, salty and full of garlic flavor. The Parmesan cheese added so much flavor to the fries even you don't dip them into the dressing. The order came with ranch and ketchup. The ketchup tasted pretty fresh and unique unlike bottled ketchup sauce fast food place used.    Overall I had a great dining experience but I will skip onion ring s next time and try different burger."}
{"text":"OMG, the food here was heaven!  Just drooling thinking about his other restaurants when just his burger and fries alone are 5 stars!  This is a must go place! Burger was so delicious.  Hearty, flavorful, and juicy. Truffle fries were plump, garlicy, and cheesy. Just the way I like it!  Would definitely go back here in a heartbeat =D (Oh but one drawback was that the napkins smelt like dirty rags... should use better cleaning method)"}
{"text":"Very very disappointed in this restaurant for the staff and more so the manager. I ordered the pork burger and specifically asked to make sure there was zero pink on the inside ... I even said cut the burger in 1/2 if you need to. I can't eat it pink, it will be fine if you feel it will be dry. The bartender said no problem he would take care of it, of course very nice at that time. The wait was extremely long - over 1 hour. Then here comes our food .. My pork burger came out as pink as a beef burgers equivalent! I called them over then they said there is no way to do this non pink and said I was crazy for asking. They turned it on me as if they could have said no it's impossible to cook it that way. I would have ordered something else. The manager and staff never apologized and I had to 'tell' them to take it off my bill because I was not eating it. They offered to do nothing to try and fix the issue ... The manager (female) was a complete snotty brat! FYI ... My BF loved his chicken sandwich. To be fair. Needless to say there was no tip."}
{"text":"We ate here on Wednesday for my birthday lunch, I got the Farm Burger which had duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar cheese and a fried egg on it, BEST burger I've ever had! My wife got the American burger, which has your typical toppings (cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickle and onion). We also got a side order of fries (they do not come with the burger) and a side of beer battered Maui onion rings, the portions are huge so I recommend only getting one of each if there's only two people ordering.  I also ordered the Whiskey Cherry Lemonade, oh dear God, it was SO good! Definitely a must try! The drink menu is on an iPad that the waitress shows you quickly, but then leaves it at the table for you to browse, very interesting! The waitress overheard us talking about my birthday plans and right after dinner a very handsome man (I assume he was the manager) came over to the table with a Sticky Toffee Pudding Push-Up Pop for me with a candle and said he had heard it was my birthday, that the pop was on the house and he could sing to me if I wanted.  The entire staff was incredibly attentive and super friendly. Being a \"high end\" burger joint, I didn't feel uncomfortable at all, it's a very relaxed atmosphere. When the check came, there was an old iPhone inside of it with a quick preloaded survey to take if you want.  I can't wait to get back here."}
{"text":"Good burgers.  Got the Euro burger, the chanterelle burger, and the classic one.  Ordered up some truffle fries and the regular fries.  It was hard to tell the difference, personally.  It was the sauce that was different.  Next time we will try the sweet potato fries.  Hot dog was humongous!!!  Great service!"}
{"text":"Have to go with a three star here. Service was great the food was hit or miss. I've had better burgers here in Philly.   Michelle, the MIL and I noticed a long line along the side of the restaurant so I approached the hostess stand and asked for a table. We were seated immediately so I have no idea why there was this long strange line.   Perused the menu and the cool IPad drink menu and off we went. A nice selection of brews fromaround the world. Ordered the truffle Parmesan fries with the truffle aioli. Let me tell you how good these fries were and that aioli. I probably could have put that on a turd and it would be fantastic. I wanted to bathe in it. Also ordered the onion rings with chipolte ketchup and cheddar ranch dip. Again solid option, Nice and crisp with just the right bite. The girls went with the blue burgers and I the the hog burger. The hog was mangalitsa pork, english sharp cheddar, apple butter and arugula. Nice flavor but wasn't that impressed. We did not order dessert.   Overall it was good but we've had better burgers back at home."}
{"text":"If you would like a lot of food for your money then this place may not be the best choice.  The Burger was nothing to write home about and they are not doing this american classic any justice. I have had better burgers at a Mom and Pop establishment, but their Truffle fries were terrific! The Shakes are some of the best that I have ever had."}
{"text":"Really bad. I had to wait an hour to get seated and then another 30 min for the food. When I asked the waiter where is the food he told me that the ticket got lost."}
{"text":"Great food and welcoming service even with our HUGE group.  Drinks were always coming and the food, though took a long time, was perfect!  The parm truffle fries are amazing!!  2nd time there and will deff return again."}
{"text":"The spicy poppers are a must try! It is served on a platter with 5, all of moderate spicy flavor. The trick? One of them is especially fiery, as they left on the seeds! It's like this on every serving, and the surprise popper is just that- a suppress. If you like spicy, this is a lot of fun! The burgers are wonderful as well, of course. The menu has a lot of variety and is very unique. I was really happy with my dining experience here, and brought my dad back to try it again. A fun place for a nice dinner in Vegas without breaking the budget or needing to be wasted to enjoy ;)"}
{"text":"We had the Gordon burger, off menu, a surprising $20 each. It's probably the best burger I've ever had!  The shake # 2 was amazing!   Who would have thought to put coconut pudding on a shake. So good!!  The Parmesan truffle fries were ok. Antioxidant blast, pretty good."}
{"text":"A great place overall -- service is super friendly and quick, the drinks are great, and the food is amazing. To find a delicious, well-priced restaurant in Vegas is saying something, so this place is a must-try. The decor is pretty astounding, and by decor I mean the wall logo that is on fire.  I got the Farm Burger and it was cooked perfectly, and so big that I could barely finish it. After watching so many GR shows, it was a treat to get to eat at one of his restaurants. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place for lunch. While there were three of us, we all ended up ordering the same thing.   Shake #4 - Crème brûlée pudding, Oreo shake, and topped with a Oreo cookie  - Quite possibly the best shake I've ever had. I don't know how to describe it otherwise. Their other shakes sound amazing but I don't know how I wouldn't order this one again.   Parmesan truffle fries - Most places I've been to use thin cut fries for this, but BurGR uses the big steak fries. They were delicious, but after we finished our burgers we couldn't eat much of this.   Farm Burger - topped with duck bacon, sharp cheddar, and a fried egg - Cooked exactly to order and had a lot of flavor. This gives me faith that I can find a great burger outside of the south.   Service was good and efficient. We didn't have to wait around much for anything.  Go here if you're craving a burger and a shake."}
{"text":"Two of us had dinner here on Friday, 10/16/15. Got on line about 6:45. Wasn't long at all and probably not more than a 10 minute or so wait. They do not take reservations.  The Food. We ordered a Farm Burger medium rare (duck breast bacon & fried egg - hold the cheese) and a Hells Kitchen Burger medium well (cheese, roasted jalapenos and roasted tomato - hold the avocado) . The super fresh bun was just right - not too much or too little bread. The burger - both were perfectly grilled and very tastefully seasoned. Hand Cut Fries - served in a large cone, hand cut fresh potatoes and were delicious. They are served with ketchup and chipotle ketchup. Onion rings were very good also. They're the very large, thick breaded version, crisp and tasty. These are served with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch. (By the way - struck up a conversation with the couple at the table next to us and traded two onion rings for some of their sweet potato fries. Judging from sweet potato fries I've had at various restaurants, I'd say they're difficult to get right -- either too wimpy or so crisped that there's nothing left inside.  These were absolutely the best I ever tasted.  The service. It was wonderful. Drinks were continually refilled. Food came out timely and was hot. Server checked on our table more than once to ask if everything was satisfactory. Here's where I was really impressed. The onion rings are sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese. However, we asked that ours not have the cheese. When the runner brought our food, he knew we held back the cheese and was sure to point out that the ranch served with the rings contained cheese. Then it wasn't 10 seconds later our waiter came by to advise us of the same thing. Like I said, very impressive!  They offer wonderful shakes. We were too full, but as we were staying at Planet Hollywood and would be in the casino most of the night, and on Fridays Burgr is open until 2 a.m., we went back sometime later for a coffee shake topped with chocolate pudding and a banana shake with butterscotch pudding on top. Need I say more?  Even though we live in Florida we try to get to Vegas twice a year for 5 days at a shot. I think Burgr will now be on the \"must have dinner here\" list for every trip."}
{"text":"This is our second time coming here in two days and there is a wait time but our waiter (Garret) and food (Hells Kitchen Burger) was phenomenal! I highly recommend this to anyone who is coming to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Amazing burger, amazing service, and amazing set up. Worth the price for the burger. A lot of details and quality in the food."}
{"text":"Line was huge. Luckily i came alone and walked immediately up to the bar. Service was good as I was greeting right as I sat down.  The beer selection is surprisingy decent.  Place is really packed. Even on a Tuesday evening.  Ordered the farm house burger. It's a duck burger with an egg on top of it. The burger is juicy and the bacon adds a great semblance of crunch."}
{"text":"BurGR is located in the Planet Hollywood casino.  We were here on a Saturday night.  The wait was only about 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, they sat us at a table that was literally in the middle of the aisle by ourselves.  It was awkward having the employees and other patrons have to walk around our table for 2.  We were greeted by our waiter and an ipad which had a menu of alcoholic drinks on it.  Nice touch but we didn't want to drink, we wanted to eat.  He left the ipad and did not return for a good 10 minutes.  We were ready to order.  He finally came back and seemed put off by the fact that we weren't ordering alcohol.  He was about to leave again when we asked to order our food.  He begrudgingly took our order.  We had the Hell's Kitchen burger, the five spice chicken sliders, and onion rings.  And then we waited.  And waited.  I stopped keeping track at 30 minutes.  While we waited, the guy at the table next to us managed to knock over a glass of champagne all over my purse and boots.  Drunk.   The food finally came with no apology for the slow service  The Hell's Kitchen Burger was really good.  Very spicy and flavorful.  The bun was light.  The chicken sliders were not good.  Weird taste and weird chicken.  The onion rings with the curry ketchup were also very good.  When our waiter delivered our check, he then apologized for not being attentive because it was busy.  Busy?  Really?  And an apology right before I leave my tip....  good timing, buddy."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago.  Best decision for lunch!    We got there right before this ginormous line formed behind us.  I couldn't imagine waiting but we managed to get seated in ample timing.  Regardless, we would've waited and would have been happy with the wait.  The decor is pretty cool.  I would describe it as clean cute and modern, and the huge fire wall definitely is an eye catcher.  It took awhile for our server to actually get to our table but we didn't really mind since we were in awe of the restaurant itself and reading through the menu as well as drink/dessert menu on our very iPad at our table.  The placed it our table and told us how to navigate through it.    I can't remember the name of the burger I ordered but it had bacon and an egg on it.  I also order the parmesan fries and a beer.  The wait for the food was a little long but I think that's the time needed to make our burgers taste as delicious as they did.  So juicy and well seasoned!!!  You can tell how fresh the ingredients were.  It makes you really appreciate good food.  There were so many fries!!!!  Definitely enough for two people to share.  I was only 3/4 done with my burger and 1/2 way through my fries and was pretty full.  Despite how full I was, I had to finish that delicious burger.  The fries however, we couldn't finish.   Overall, I will definitely eat here again.  The burger was outstanding and the staff was really helpful.    Gordon Ramsay, expectations were definitely met that day! :-)"}
{"text":"They seat groups faster than couples or singles. We opted for a seat at the bar. They brought the fries and the ketchup was very tasty. We both got burgers but the menu had a wide variety of choices with many flavors for different experiences."}
{"text":"Highly recommend  Atmosphere: 1 Star Cleanliness: 1 Star Service:1/4 Star Food:1 3/4 Star Price Value vs Food Quality: 1 Star  This was a great place to visit and the food was good. It's Vegas so you can expect to pay more than usual. Plus it's a Gordon Ramsey location and tack on a little more as expected. However, meals were still cheaper than I was expecting before we arrived. They were actually more reasonable. Beyond the eating at a Ramsey location it's still a great place to go. Make reservations and check it out.   ATMOSPHERE/CLEANLINESS The atmosphere is an open area inside the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino. The actual chairs and tables are comfortable and enough room for you and your guest meals. We had a group of 6 eating lunch on a weekday and there was enough room for us all. The tables, chairs, and even menus were all neat and clean. No food on the floors, no left over residue, etc. They have this huge window display with tons of flames burning which is neat and the decor is modern slightly fashion forward design. It looks cook no doubt.  MAKE RESERVATIONS!!! Do not even attempt to get inside without one. The line for people to get in is usually very very long no matter what time of the day or night. We tried and the waits were always an hour or more. So make your reservation which we finally did and got right in for lunch then.   SERVICE Service is where they lost some points for me. The server was great at the start. Very friendly, energetic, knew the menu well, answered questions. All of the great things you would expect from a server especially a Ramsey server. However, after we ordered our server never really came back and checked on us. We had multiple drinks empty and no one came. The food took a LONG time to come out and we flagged our server down to ask. We finally got drink refreshes and our food eventually came. I was not impressed with the server after the initial order. Even his follow up after the meal arrived was lacking.  FOOD AMAZING....I am done writing one word says it all. OK you twisted my arm :).  I ordered the Farm Burger with Truffle Parmesan Fries. The Farm Burger is duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, fried egg. The Truffle Parmesan Fries are hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aïoli.   This is clearly going to be in my top all time favorite burgers ever!  My dining guests had various styles of burgers and side such as onion rings and regular fries and all enjoyed it immensely. One item to note that we all questioned how good it would be was the chicken burger. One of the group ordered this and said it was absolutely awesome. Lots of great flavor. All the burgers were cooked perfectly!   PRICE Value vs. Food Quality. When we consider its Vegas and a brand like Gordan Ramsey I expected the burgers to be $25+ each. However, I was pleasantly surprised the burger was only$16 and then you add on some fries and then you are back up to $25. So in the end I was right it's a $25 meal. However, you get to pick the sides or even go without a side and eat just the burger.   Based on the cost and the flavor and portions we received I was very happy with the value I received for the food quality and portion. Good Job Mr. Ramsey keeping the experience reasonable for the average person."}
{"text":"Get here early if you want lunch...there is def a wait! Food was good but nothing extra special...a little disappointing because it is a Ramsay place. Service was very slow but nice...burgers are good but just not amazing. I suggest getting onion rings and fries....the onion rings are really good!!"}
{"text":"I went to Burgr back in June but had to take the time to leave a review! We waited in line about 20 minutes but it was WORTH IT :) The staff was very courteous and brought us to a booth as soon as it became available. I ordered the hells kitchen burger and onion rings! Wow, those onion rings are SOOOOO delish and my burger literally melted in my mouth. This place is definitely on the repeat list the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and Micheal, camaro guy, and  Vin Diesel look alike took amazing care of us. Thank you for the entertainment while dinning."}
{"text":"The best chicken wings  in town ,burgers are excellent choice and fries my good you must have it love this place"}
{"text":"Went there as a party of 4. There was a line so we had to wait about 20min to get a table, which was OK. Ordered a plethora of food from the menu as i wanted to sample quite a few items. Ordered: Beer battered onion rings Sweet potato fries Just fries Euro Burger Uber cheese burger Fish and crisp sandwich  The onion rings, sweet potato fries and both burgers were straight up delicious. Probably some of the best burgers I've ever had.  The Fish and crisp sandwich was not too good in my opinion. fish and bun were really greasy and lacked flavor.   The regular fries were just OK, little bit too salty.  I would still go back there and enjoy to delicious burgers though."}
{"text":"I enjoyed our visit to BurGR and thankfully we didn't have to wait too terribly long to be seated. But the time we left the line for 2 tops was INSANELY long. They dont have a ton of options to chose from, but you are bound to find something that fits your taste. I had the Uber Cheese Burger w/ Asadero cheese + fontina cheese +boursin cheese + vintage white cheddar. It was tasty, but for $15 I at least expected either a side or to be WOWED by the burger. I was actually more impressed by the Truffle Parmesan Fries that one of my friends ordered, but at $11 I'm glad I didn't order those AND my burger. Would I go back? Probably not since there are a lot of other tasty options on the strip for around the same price."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  I have always been intrigued by Gordon Ramsay and his restaurants.  I have not tried his high end restaurant yet, Gordon Ramsey Steak, but I decided to try BurGR in Planet Hollywood.  The line was ridiculous but move pretty fast.  We waited about 30 minutes in total to be seated.    I went with the Euro Burger, apparently one of their top burgers per the waiter, and really enjoyed it.  Still, a burger for $15 is usually a struggle for me to digest because it is not filling enough and requires a side.  We ordered and shared some really good fries, but the fact that the burger came plain just did not sit well with me.  I understand that most high-end burger joints now do not include sides, but $20 for a burger and side seems a bit too expensive.    The burger is a little more than I think it is worth, but it was extremely juicy and delicious.  Every time I have walked by BurGR there has been a line, so I might have to try it again and test out another burger to see if I feel the same way.  Still it is worth a go if you want a quality hamburger on the strip."}
{"text":"So what does one do when they are hungry, loitering in the PH casino, and there is no line waiting for a table at BurGR... well, one walks right in a gets a table!  How lucky were we?  Nice ambiance, nice greeters/waitstaff (and, yes, I enjoyed the uniforms), great menu.  I only wish that I had seen the counter seating.  It was so much fun to watch the kitchen activities from the table and I imagine it is even more fun from the counter.   Let me say this, and be perfiectly clear: I love burgers, and I especially love a great burger.  Having fussed over the menu and really having a difficult time choosing... I opted for a dawg.  Yup... there I was, craving a dawg at a burger place... all because I saw this humongous, yummy looking dawg sitting on the counter awaiting delivery to some diner lucky enough to have ordered before us.  Well, let me say this... and be perfectly clear again:  All of our burgers, fries, onion rings, and even the dawg were darn good.  Two criticisms, though, if I may:  1.  Not everyone likes Pepsi.  Some of us like Coke, as in Coca Cola.  Can't you serve Coke too?  2.  The Chile Dawg.  Now this will sound odd, but it is a damned good dawg.  But it ain't much of a chile dawg.  Since when does two slices of fresno chile and two slices of jalepeno -- which appear from their thinness to have been sliced with a truffle slicer -- transform a damned good dawg into a chile dawg?  If I may, please consider changing the name from Chile Dawg to \"Damned Good Dawg with a hint of chile\" or \"CaliDawg Light\"."}
{"text":"Great menu. Got food togo, but the bartender (do not know his name? The bald guy? ) Sorry :( was so very nice. Very engaging while still allowing you to carry on convo. Randomly met some ladies from same area i am from. The only reason i didnt give 5 stars is because i have not tried the food yet. Even though he forgot to put togo he still gets an a+ from me. Very sweet."}
{"text":"The good:  Food was very good.  I got the British Burger that had chutney on it.  We also got the truffle fries.  My wife ordered the American burger...all delicious.  The very bad (that would make Gordon mad)  They gave me the bill and credit card of another patron.  I never realized it until I tried to use the credit card later in the day.  I wound up not having to pay for the meal (as I'm sure the other patron didn't either -- never saw the charge appear on my card.  It taught me a lesson to always review the bill closely and also make sure the credit card handed back to me is in fact mine."}
{"text":"For a Burger joint... this place is definitely 5 Stars!! I am a first timer here and have heard nothing but good things. Now I see why!  It is a very modern establishment with really nice decor. I really like the color scheme.  Now for the juicy stuff (literally). I got the hell kitchen, everyone else got the truffle burger and the yardbird. We shared an order of gooey fries and I'm not going to regret the extra Calories. Burgers were so juicy and perfectly seasoned. Gooey fries were  outrageously amazing. When in Vegas and you are craving a good burger, personally I would skip Shake Shack and come here every time.  Well done Gordon"}
{"text":"Had to check this place out due to being a huge fan of Gordo.  As you may anticipate, the staff is very diligent and efficient in their execution.  Turn and burn is the name of the game in this high traffic area (in planet hollywood).  With that said, the staff was helpful and my drink was never empty.  Got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Truffle Fries.  Both were excellent, but if I were anywhere else, I would never pay what I did here.  However, the experience coupled with a solid product left me walking away happy.  Just know that you are paying for the experience with your meal and you will be satisfied."}
{"text":"We had several random ppl tell us how amazing the burgers were, some were even making a 2nd return trip. we waited  patiently for 30 min. Not too long for a Saturday night.  Was excited to try the Hell's Kitchen burger and the chanterell burgers. We also got the Parmesan fries.  We mentioned to the waiter we were splitting them to share and asked if they could be cut in half. He  politely said you have a knife. (Minus a star)The food arrived in good time and was the burgers were perfectly cooked. They could have been hotter . The Fries were good but we didn't care for the sauces. The Hell's burger had nice heat from the roasted jalapeño sadly the avocado was not good and spoiled the overall  impression. The chanterell was tasty and I love the arugula.  All in all an okay experience but nothing wow'd me."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is off.  From the ridiculously low-to-the-ground seats to the absurdly long wait time to be seated.  Once we finally got seated we waited even longer for our food.  One would think if there's going to be a long wait time for food that the restaurant would rush the appetizers or serve some sort of bread.  No such luck.  This restaurant is over priced and over hyped."}
{"text":"Flavourless burger. Over cooked onion rings. Way better burgers for way less money other places in Vegas"}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars because of the service.  The food and drinks were incredible. My fiancé and I decided to sit at the bar and did not feel very welcome. The bartender was not mean he just seemed like he didn't want to be there at all. I will say that a man walked in asking everyone at the bar to hurry up so he and his girlfriend could sit at the bar( so rude). Our bartender handled it very well and the couple were escorted out. We will come back but not sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've had in my life. The burger was SO flavorful and it practically melted in my mouth. The farm burger was brilliant and the Hell's Kitchen burger had a nice spicy kick! The Oreo shake has the perfect balance of thickness and sweetness. Lastly, the Parmesan truffle fries are a must!   On New Year's Eve, the wait for two for dinner was about 25 min. Gordon Ramsay keeps a high standard for the restaurant and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good good, very good prices. All dishes around $15. Service was great and cute!   Everyone at my table who ordered burgers were very pleased. The poppers were good.   Wait for table can be long. Suggest putting your name in 30min prior."}
{"text":"I have to say that only one thing was not to my liking....i had to wait.... Booooo, but than after seated the magic began.... Food does not disappoint at all.... The service is where it was all at tho.... I will return some day...."}
{"text":"As expected the burgers were fantastic! One of the best i've had. We tried the chanterelle burger and the hell's kitchen. Very different but both equally great. Even though we got medium well, the burgers were still very soft and juicy. The truffle fries were huge. I presonally prefer thinner cut fries and these were more english style thick potato chips but still pretty tasty.   Food: 5/5 Service and atmosphere: 4/5 Price: 4.5/5 (considering it is in Vegas and but GR, the price is pretty reasonable)  Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"Jalapeño poppers were out of this world.  Burgers were NOT impressive.  Servers were mostly friendly.  Good but not worth the price."}
{"text":"My Buddha and I read about this place and thought to give it a shot. We waiting in line for maybe 15 minutes and sat at the bar. The bartender Mario was great with us! Offering beer tasting until we found the one we wanted. Suggested great burgers and the truffle fries! I had the Hells Kitchen Burger and haven't had a burger from a restaurant taste so delicious! Cooked to perfection at Medium and the avocado brought out a fresh flavor it.   The other bartender that was working was rude. A foreign couple came and sat next to us at the bar. They were order drinks and there was a language barrier, but the bartender had no patience! He brought them the wrong drinks then got upset with them because he didn't understand them when myself and Buddy knew exactly what they wanted.   Overall I highly suggest you go here! Great food at great price!!"}
{"text":"I took my almost 15 year old to Gordon Ramsey's Burgr this week because he's a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen and loves Gordon Ramsey.  We arrived around 10:00 p.m. and there was a pretty good little line to get in. If you're a party of 3 or more, you see the hostess. Otherwise you wait. It took about 25 minutes to be seated. Our server, Chelsea was just wonderful. She informed us that they are rebranding, and she gave my son several freebies. The menu, coasters, pens. He was in Heaven! We did it up big and ordered burgers; the Bleu burger for me, and the Farm burger for my son. Both were delicious!  My son also ordered the \"Gooey\" fries, which were seriously a pound of thick cut fries covered in Gouda, salami, and an over Easy egg. They were insanely good! We also decided to try the milkshakes, which cone topped with pudding and a cookie. I know, a heart attack waiting to happen , right, but I don't think you're going to a Gordon Ramsey burger joint to eat healthy. You're there for the experience, so you gotta live a little. My shake was coffee flavored ice cream topped with chocolate pudding. My son got the Oreo shake topped with creme brûlée pudding and an Oreo cookie. Both were delicious.  Our bill including tip came to $78. The \"Gooey\" fries were $13, almost as much as the burgers.  The shakes could easily be split. I couldn't finish mine; it was just too much. As good as the fries were, we barely put a dent in them .  It was a fun place to eat, and my son walked away with great memories. That alone is worth the price of admission."}
{"text":"The Good:  BURGERS - The Chanterelle burger is amazing!!! Arugula, mushrooms and grilled onions!! Burgers here are cooked PERFECTLY the way you order them. If you order your burger medium, the meat is tender and pink throughout. Beware then if you are ordering burgers based on how badly other restaurants interpret this scale. The burgers are also very flavorful--these aren't your lame Island's burgers over here.  The Not-so-great: FRIES aren't great here. The dipping sauce helps to mask this. I feel they are stale and overcooked. Also the WAIT to get in can be difficult, however they will text you when your table becomes ready."}
{"text":"I have been there two times. The restaurant is nice, the service is good and the burgers are great. I had the Hell's kitchen burger and the Damnation chicken burger and both were amazing, perfectly cooked and built with great ingredients. The prices of the burger are not even too high if you consider the location in the middle of the Strip.   I would definitely come back if I came back to Vegas, no doubt."}
{"text":"Onion rings were awesome!  Peanut Butter shake was decadent.  Burgers were amazing with excellent flavor and ingredient combination.  Service was good and the place was busy so there was a bit of a wait.  Waitress outfits were skimpy and G.R. did a great job designing the restaurant, food and experience."}
{"text":"The Hell's Kitchen burger was pretty delicious, not mind blowing. The one item I was very delighted with was the jalapeño poppers. Definitely a must try! My husband added last minute the quinoa salad and that was delicious!!!! Super glad he added that."}
{"text":"Really good burgers and fries! Drinks were great as well. We did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated but it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Went there on 11/4 for lunch.  There was a line before the restaurant even opened, but we were seated quickly.  The waiter was very helpful and attentive.  I had the Hell's Kitchen burger - it was very juicy and tasty.  The ingredients are all fresh, and the buns are fresh made! My husband had the hog burger and I tried a bite.  The flavors are really unique with cheese and apple butter - husband is now a big fan of this burger.  We also shared the truffle parmesan fries - one order is enough for two.  They were really good, my only complaint would be all the parmesan is on top, so after you eat the first few fries, the rest are just plan French fries and I couldn't taste any truffle oil.  The prices are high, but the food is quality and not your run of the mill burger."}
{"text":"On a recent trip with a few girlfriends we went to Burgr and we were not disappointed! We walked up around 1:30, checked in with the host, got a reasonable wait time of about 30 minutes. They took my phone number and said they would text when our table was ready. Excellent idea!  I had the special GR burger and it was incredible. My friends got the veggie and the frenchy cheese burger. Awesome. Truffle fries to round it out with AMAZING condiments. The only fly was my burger was over cooked. I usually do medium rare and this was medium. But even over cooked it was fantastic.  I had the gin green tea cocktail friends had beer. Drink menu was pretty cool on an ipad , so pretty interactive. The space itself was very nice, if a bit loud, but nothing outrageous. If I am ever in town again, I will eat there again!"}
{"text":"I don't do many 5 star reviews, so this must have been really good.   In Vegas and wanted a good burger.  The plan was go to the burger bar in Mandalay Bay, but we decided Brgr was closer and easier.    It was a little difficult to find inside Planet Hollywood. I think it could use more signage. The wait wasn't bad, about 20 minutes. Lots to look at so it wasn't frustrating.   We started with drinks. My wife got a drink with egg whites in it, and she really liked it. I stuck with beer. It of course was good.   I like spicy food so we got the jalapeño poppers. The came in a pretty unique presentation. Each popper was in a shot glass with the dipping sauce in the bottom. The sause was great. The coating was crunchy as well. They put a little fun into it, by leaving the seeds in one of them, and you don't know which one.  If you are looking for something to gripe about, I would say that the jalapeño itself was a little hard to bite through, and came out of the coating a little.   My wife ordered the hell kitchen burger. She seemed to like it a lot, especially since she didn't talk a lot once it came.   I got the Uber cheese burger. 3 cheeses, including goat cheese. Wow. So much flavor, cooked excellent. Juicy. The everything bun was soft and great. It made the burger.   For sides we got the parmesian sweet potato fries. The topping was so good, and the dipping sauce was delicious. It was almost like a dessert. There is enough for 2. We also got the onion rings. The were huge, and very crunchy. Maybe a little to crunchy. But awesome. Great flavor. I stuck with the bbq dipping sauce. I don't think we finished it. We were full.   The restaurant is laid out nicely, lots of TV showing sports. The wait staff was on top of it and friendly.   It was pricey, but it's vegas and the food was great."}
{"text":"Sad to say I was very disappointed with my burger! :( It was very dry and plain. I would rather eat in n out.. Definitely not worth the price!!!"}
{"text":"Arrived around 8 and had to wait in line for 20 minutes which was odd because there were plenty of open tables. Not sure if they were understaffed or what the deal was.   Food was awesome though! The Farm Burger is the best burger I've ever had! It's got a quail egg and duck bacon on top which makes for a delicious combination. The truffle fries were pretty good, not the best I've ever had.   I'd say the service was above average and the staff was friendly and knowledgable.   Highly recommend anyone else to try it out while in Vegas especially if you're looking for a good burger."}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen Burger is mouth- watering. Soft baked buns, creamy avocado layer, medium rare meet covered with fresh mozzarella cheese all together is a STAR."}
{"text":"I've been watching Gordon Ramsey since I could remember and I felt so honored to be able to eat at his restaurant. I'm a burger eater, I eat a burger everywhere I go and his burger is the best of the bet burgers I've ever tasted! To eat at the restaurant of the man who hosts master chef/junior, Hell's Kitchen, and more, is almost surreal. I definitely hope e I can eat there again"}
{"text":"Burger was absolutely amazing. Ate the truffle and friend had Pork Burger- both equally as delectable. Not a moral left on the plate as we both ate in silence over our unbelievable dish.   The fries however....save your money. Subpar to say the least. They were simply \"doughy\" and unevenly caked with whatever topping they came with (tried both \"gooey\" and \"truffle\").   The manager, Scott, was super awesome though and made sure that everything was taken care of to expectation! Thanks!   Would recommend this to others visiting the area (minus the fries of course)."}
{"text":"The service was good but we were completely let down by the food. My girl is all about Gordon and we were so excited but the food was not great. Got the Hell Kitchen Burger and had to try the Devil Dog...neither one was spicy. I literally got little to no heat and very little flavor. I would have enjoyed Fudruckers more. Very disappointed. I think you are just paying for the experience."}
{"text":"I was super excited to come to this restaurant, especially since I'm such a big fan of masterchef and gordon ramsay. haha. Anyway, I ordered a farm burger and had regular fries and onion rings as appetizers. The burger was good - very juicy and well cooked, but I just felt like something was missing. I still enjoyed it, but I guess my expectations were a little high. The fries were fries, the onion rings were onion rings, pretty normal, but I loved the dipping sauces that came with both. They made the fries and onion rings taste amazing. I also had a milkshake (the one with oreos),  and it was SO GOOD...probably the best milkshake I had ever had. It was, however, almost $10, so i kind of expected it to be something special anyway.   All of their burgers are around $14-$16 dollars and their fries and milkshakes are all about $10. I went with my family as a party of 4 and we waited about 45 min. The service is good, the waiters are all friendly and smiley.   Overall, I really enjoyed the experience at this restaurant. Will probably be back again the next time I go to vegas to try something new.   Note: The restaurant is in the Planet Holleywood hotel, the very first restaurant when you walk through the entrance of the Miracle Mile Shops."}
{"text":"Sorry I had to give a 2 star..  Services was good but the burger was blah I had higher expectations from this place. I think i had better burgers at a mom and pop burger stands in LA. The female hostess in the front seem like they didn't want to work they seem all grumpy and moody and I didn't even get greeted no hi or hello. Will I return back to this place no I won't."}
{"text":"I have to say that I am disappointed. I came in with high expectations because I mean this is Gordon Ramsay. I know he doesn't actually work here and only comes every so often to check up, but still it's his restaurant and I would think he'd at least put out something that could live up to his name. I mean I left full, but disappointed.   1) Hell's Kitchen Burger: this honestly just wasn't good for me. It came out cold like it was left out for a long while, and I had asked for medium well, but got medium.   2) Truffle Parmesan Fries: these were actually not that bad, the truffle salt and aioli definitely helped to bring in some flavor to the fries. I would say this was the best part of my meal.   3) Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops: not amazing, it's literally just like cake with salted peanut ice cream, something you can make yourself for less. I think he has something similar at his steakhouse, which I heard tasted amazing so I figured this would too. Nope.   SERVICE: we were a large party of 9 and we had to wait about 30-35 minutes so not too bad.   PRICE: typical gourmet burger prices, I don't think it's really worth it taste wise for the price.   It's not worth the wait. Your time could be better spent elsewhere, and your tummy will be a lot happier."}
{"text":"The service was very slow. VERY SLOW.  I'm a fan and I was disappointed in my dining experience won't go back there again"}
{"text":"The Dining Experience: BURGR has a large staff of hostesses, bus boys, and waiters/waitresses. You are guaranteed to have great service at this restaurant. The ambiance captures a fun eating experience with a large piece of fire artwork at the front door that lights the restaurant well in the background. The kitchen is loud and as I said, there is a lot of staff, I felt the atmosphere was fast paced and not really a restaurant to sit down for a deep conversation. But an enjoyable experience no doubt!  The Food: Proportions of the burgers are perfect and filling.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my boyfriend ordered the Euro Burger. We also shared a side of onion rings and that was plenty of food for us both. The burgers are large and filling, but I say that the meat is a bit too dry for my taste. The onion rings, though crispy and delicious were just a tad too salty for my taste and were soggy by the time you hit the bottom of the container  Thoughts: Although the food is amazing, I probably wouldn't go back (because of the price), but I would definitely recommend you to try! Chef Ramsey does know how to create a well balanced and delicious burger.   For the restaurant designer... I recommend picking higher chairs. The tables come up to your chest, and it's awfully uncomfortable to eat a big burger at that height."}
{"text":"Last year, my boyfriend and I went on a whim and decided to try out BurGR. It was about high noon on a Saturday, and it was to our surprise when there was no wait to be seated. My expectations were only growing by the minute.   The interior was stunning - nice seating arrangement and unique decor. We first ordered our drinks and some fries to start us off. Surprisingly, the fries were nearly soggy. They weren't even cooked to where it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - just plain mushy. Nonetheless, I didn't really fuss about it, and kept on eating. Then our entrees came out; I ordered a pasta and he ordered a burger. Based upon the description of my pasta, I was expecting flavorful goooodness - but I didn't. Pasta was lacking more sauce (although even if they did add more sauce, there'd be no difference because the sauce was flavorless and quiet unappetizing). I only wish I remembered what pasta is was. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger, although commented that he's had better in the past.   All-in-all, the aura of the environment was pleasant, service was kind, and I had a lovely date; I just wish my food was as great. Probably will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"When we showed up here, there was a huge line-up, but... we actually got in fairly quickly which was a pleasant surprise.  We ordered the jalepeno poppers which were presented creatively, nice crunchy coating and very flavorful, you get 6 in total which I think is perfect for two diners.  I ordered the Farm Burger, medium rare which includes an egg and duck bacon.  I don't know how they did it, but omg!  the egg yolk was medium, the duck bacon was to die for, so tender, not greasy at all.  The meat was rarer than a medium rare but that's ok by me as it was seasoned so well and not greasy, fresh toasted buns.  The burger was not messy or sloppy, only three drops of grease on my plate after I was finished.  I have to admit, it's the best burger I've ever had.   One thing you'll notice is that there is no salt or pepper on your table and I think that's because you don't need it!!!!!    My fiancé had the truffle burger and truffle fries.  He had nothing to say except, \"Mmmmmm\".     Oh!  the margarita I had was really good, not the average marg that's for sure.  The service was outstanding, very attentive and the time allowed between the appetizer and our meal was perfect.  We will definantly be back again.  Highly recommended!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Hells Kitchen burger and yam fries were awesome. Went went around 1130 and the line up was only five minutes and the wait for food was  the usual.   My husband had he Hellfire Chicken burger with onion rings and really enjoyed it all.  The only downside on this adventure was that my husband got a huge splinter off the chair.  We notified the staff and the girls said that the get them all the time snagging their dresses. Guess the chairs need a good sanding!"}
{"text":"Seriously, if you are ever looking for a caloric splurge this is the place to ditch your diet.  Order the Oreo shake.  It's topped with creme brûlée and has bits of caramelized goodness sprinkled on top.  It's large enough to share although the chef won't split them (just ask the waitress for two spoons- they are happy to oblige).  Burgers were awesome: Hells and Big Blue were ordered.  Couldn't finish either one since we shared truffle fries to start.  Great vibe.  Cool waitress.  Just be prepared that you may wait if you don't have a reservation.  It's a popular spot and for good reason."}
{"text":"If you want a great service and food experience on a modest budget, BurGR is a great way to explore the Gordon Ramsay style of service and cooking without breaking the bank.  You get the knowledgeable servers and great tasting food (although, in the end, it is still a burger, which no matter how well you do it doesn't compare to, say, Wagyu or Kobe beef filets).  We came in mid week at 7pm and waited less than 10 minutes to be seated.  It's not a restaurant for privacy, no, but overall an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Went last weekend with some girlfriends and they were raving about Ramsay's BurGR place, so we had to check it out. We made sure to get to the restaurant early as people have stated there can be quite a wait.  We got to the restaurant 5 minutes before opening and there was already a line! We were one of the first ones in line so we were seated right away but the restaurant was full by the time we left!  The restaurant decor reminds me of Hell's Kitchen show with the open kitchen and obviously big fire sign out front.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and thoroughly enjoyed it! The meat was cooked perfectly,  it was very juicy, and the jalapeño had a real nice kick. The other girls ordered the Farm and Euro and were all very happy! The truffle fries were great, and so were the onion rings, but we didn't love the sweet potato.    Biggest annoyance is the restaurant is open to the Casino, so the smokers in that area ruin the food for me.  Our overall meal was over $100 for 3 girls. We each got a burger side and drink.  So for the price I am paying, I don't want to be inhaling smoke. Overall great food but won't be going back again.   Food - * * * * Price - * * *  Service - * * * * Ambiance - * *"}
{"text":"Bless their souls for serving me and my 6 girlfriends while we were absolutely wasted. They were so sweet.  The Hell's Kitchen burger was really good, but I honestly don't remember why. I remember us all thinking it was amazing though. The avocado was SO fresh. The burger did not taste as good warmed up later, so try to finish it all in one sitting.  I really enjoyed the truffle fries! Also enjoyed the wings.   Be prepared to WAIT!! We came after a pool party so half of us got the reservation while half of us showered (we stayed at the Cosmo) and then the other half went to shower and came back to join us in line and we STILL had to wait a bit. Not sure how long that took but it must have been awhile if 7 girls could shower and walk to the restaurant before we could sit down...  I would say it was worth it though! Unless you're some kind of burger connoisseur I guess?"}
{"text":"I don't usually give out 5 stars but this place was phenomenal.  The first time was for dinner.  Hour wait but they give you a Pager and it extended pretty far out into the casino.  A day later before leaving for the airport had to return around noon on Wednesday.  No wait.  The burgers are memorable and so was the onion rings.  We will return in the future. They can serve as many add 50000 burgers in a weekend I was told."}
{"text":"Jesus Christ this place is amazing! Loved the stuffed jalapeños! Presentation was gorgeous. I got the hog burger which was the best swine I've ever eaten! Sweet potato fries were good!(not so sure about the sauce that came with them) but it didn't even need it. Service was great, and nice too look at ;)"}
{"text":"I had the damnation chicken burger because my other half had the chanterelle burger.   My burger was good, not as spicy as I thought it would be (I wanted spicier) but it really well seasoned and cooked for a chicken burger (still juicy).   Her burger was cooked perfectly as well and the quality of the meat was top notch. The fig jam in the middle was excellent but I  thought it could have used a little more seasoning overall.   The fries were seasoned well but a little over cooked and dry in my opinion. I still want to try his steak restaurant at some point."}
{"text":"This place is over rated. And too pricey. I got the veggie burger and expected it to be good (for 16$, yeah it better be) and found myself eating it only because I was paying so much for it. Literally one of the worst things I ever had.  My boyfriend liked his, the server was good to add stuff to it and very nice.   The fries were the best part (not worth 11$) but they were awesome.   I wouldn't pay to eat here again, but if someone offered to pay for me I'd just get fries."}
{"text":"I've had better. I really expected to be blown away like I did at GR Steak.  The burgers were obviously really good quality but I just had better. If you ever are in San Francisco, go have a 4505 burger. You will know what I mean.  Service is pretty good. The host however had an attitude. The restrooms are outside of the restaurant. When I came back to the restaurant, the host even questioned me. I looked at her and was like, you just sat us. You don't remember? Anyway.  Make sure you have your TotalRewards card so you can get a discount."}
{"text":"This place deserves every ounce of hype it gets. Talk about redefining the burger. If you wish to confirm why this place always has lines that rival those of the best nightclub at Cosmopolitan, pay a visit after midnight, when the hordes are getting wasted elsewhere. You will find that even the humble AMERICAN BURGER here is vastly superior to anything you have tasted at the mainstream burger joints. My personal favorite is the HELL KITCHEN'S BURGER, but I warn you about its spiciness. It's hot. It's sexy. Your first bite of it will result in an orgasmic burst of traditional Mexican flavors fused with all the protein greatness of well-prepared American meat. Skip the sweet potato fries. Their water tastes like wonderful chlorine, so splurge on beer or if you are desperate, soda. On the weekends, get a booth and avoid the bar at all costs. The gal there is super nice, but the guy bartenders are as pleasant as an emphysemic smoker's overly ripe phloem!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite most affordable places to eat on the strip. The burgers have always been cooked perfect for me each time. They have duck bacon... If you've never had duck bacon- it is FANTASTIC! I get it on my burger every time. I also recommend ordering a burger the way the chef created... Don't add too many extras or take a bunch of things off specialty burgers. Relax and let the chefs do their job and fix up something magnificent. The drinks are great too- last time I went I had a jalapeño margarita- I like spicy and it was perfect!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to this place for awhile.  I was so glad that there was no line when we arrived.  However, as we were leaving around 6pm the line was starting to form.  We started with the onion rings that were perfectly battered and fried.  The chipotle ketchup was a nice touch.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger.  I don't really know what kind of cheese was on it, but it did not make or break the burger. It was perfectly cooked to medium.  The grilled jalepenos and avocado were perfect.  We also ordered the truffle fries that were good.  They seemed a little dry but again the chipotle ketchup helped.  The waiter seemed a little lost but tried his best.  We had to remind him a few times for water or refills and again to get the check.  He didn't make it in time to offer dessert.  I would definitely go back.  The sides are definitely worth sharing so that you can try a little of everything.  The prices are not too bad - but it's not a cheap meal.  About $25 per person with burger, side, and iced tea."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a burger. I got the Hills Kitchen burger and it was wonderful. I'm a fan of Ramsey and this made me like him even more. The French fries though might need a touch of Ramsey as I can tell they weren't the freshest of all. Over all a five starts experience."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from Vegas friends. Its on the tourist strip inside the Planet Hollywood casino but worth checking out. Get there before noon or after 2 cause the line to get in seems never ending. We got lucky that we stumbled upon it around 11am while looking for a breakfast hangover cure :) Come hungry cause the portions are big. I ordered the farm burger topped w/ duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar & fried egg. Never had duck breast bacon before but it sure was crunchy and thick...great alternative to the typical pork. My burger was prepped just right..medium rare. You have to try the parmesan french fries. Lots of flavor and sliced thick but had crunch..fried perfection. The icing on the cake was my Chocolate Hazelnut Pudding Coffee Shake Topped w/ Praline Cookie..yeah it's a mouthful and this creamy concoction sent me to food coma! I couldn't walk after so I sat at the nearby casino lounge and dozed off. See my pics."}
{"text":"My roommate and I came to Vegas for spring break and I was super excited to try this place out since it's one of the cheaper restaurant but still by Gordon Ramsay.    We had a show to catch at 9 so we wanted to have dinner at around 6:30. Unfortunately they do not take reservations... WHY?!?!  To start, we shared the sweet potato fries and the jalapeno poppers. The fries come with vanilla powder sugar and honey jalapeno mayo. The fries are fried nicely and pair really well with the powder sugar; however, we weren't a fan of the honey jalapeno mayo. It sounded good, but the mayo didn't taste that great.  The jalapeno poppers were also a let down. They seemed like they've been sitting on the counter for a little bit. It would have been a lot better if they were hot. Not only were they a let down, the jalapeno poppers also made my friends and I sick. I felt sick almost immediately after dinner and my two friends were really sick the following morning. My stomach still feels queasy just thinking a bout it... Just be warned, they are pretty spicy and could possible make your stomach on fire!  The burgers we got were solid, but the burger places in L.A. still have my heart.  I might give it another try next time I visit Vegas, but no more jalapeno poppers!"}
{"text":"It wasn't the best burger 've ever had but I'm very impressed with small details that the restaurant has. Impressive and I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"Its worth to wait for the delicious burger! We ordered 3 signatures burgers and they were all juicy and yummy! While waiting to be called, we went to the casino. Its a great spot to kill the waiting time."}
{"text":"It was a long wait. The waiter we had was friendly and seems to be very knowledgeable with wines, but we're not much of a drinker.The burger was about $15.00 each. The size was average. It didn't come with fries (seriously, at $15,I couldn't believe this). Comparing that with chilis burger, I don't think there's a $7 difference with the taste.   My kids were very impressed (they probably want to because of the price) and because they're fans of Gordon Ramsey and we searched hard before we were able to find this place (inside the casino) We ordered the fries that was recommended here, parmesan truffles? It came in a nice, cone shaped container and it did taste good. It had freshly grated parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and there's a separate garlic aioli dip which is probably just garlic, butter and some spices. It cost $11 per order. The fries had many small pieces, like it came from the ends of a potato. I'm not impressed with that. If you're going to charge $11 for potatoes pls. make sure it's the good parts you're serving.   Long wait, overpriced burgers and fries that have a lot of what looks like leftover pcs. -3 stars."}
{"text":"So I'm a half local of Vegas, my family and I wanted to try it here since it looked so cool and of course a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, we didn't wait longer than 15 minutes to get seated, food took maybe 30 minutes to come out, but I ordered a plan turkey burger (extremely picky) I even told the guy, meat and bun, no cheese, no sauce, nothing on it at all; so they brought it out with cheese, and I sent it back, they brought one out with orange sauce on it and the guy tried to tell me it was butter and I tried the sauce and he instantly took it away before I even told him I didn't like it... what kind of restaurant can't get a plain burger correct for one, and then LIE to you about what's on it? It was a good turkey burger and I ate the whole thing but seriously. Truffle fries and regular fries were really good!"}
{"text":"I assume Gordon Ramsey himself reads every single one of these reviews.  How could he not? He cares about the quality he throws his name behind, right? Because if it sucks balls, then his rep as a bad ass celebrity chef is in risk.  So, hello Gordon, I think you're a neat fellow.   I will now switch to my best British impersonation, stolen from the great Monty Python.  Those guys were also neat.  (Just pretend this is written in British style English, ok? Thanks.)  The quality of this fine establishment is excellent. I had the farm burger, with \"duck breat bacon, fried eggs, and something else.\" Maybe there was nothing else, just those first two things.  Regardless, it was a good burger.   But like all things Vegas, the presentation is prettier than the substance.  The service was rushed and slightly rude.  Not to me though.  All the girls are nice to me, because, well, who knows.  But the gentlemen flanking me at the bar apparently were asking too many questions and/or the waitress was having a bad day.  I laughed at their failure to please the server.   And also, there's the issue of price.  $24 for a fancy burger and fries? Thus the reason for 3 stars instead of 4.  If I'm paying $24 for a burger, I'm expecting the greatest burger ever made.  And this ain't it.  Tasty, but not the greatest.  At least gimme grass fed beef, or a lap dance.  That last one would probably be more appropriate.   Go here and wait for an hour plus, take pictures with the Gordon Ramsey photo, and embrace the typical Vegas experience."}
{"text":"I liked the food. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which wound up being really spicy because of the jalapeños. However, they tricked me into purchasing fries so I'm kind of annoyed."}
{"text":"Always a line waiting outside, but you will find it worthy waiting! Great burgers! And the sweet potato fries are really good, too!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey has definitely put a beautiful spin on the classic burger and shake restaurant. The decor of the place is very casual but you can tell the attention to detail that has been put into everything. From the welcome sign is done very simply in flames and is quite elegant.   The food here is absolutely amazing. We had the mushroom burger and the damnation chicken burger. Both were incredible. I think that everything on the menu has that same high level of quality that Gordon Ramsey holds so highly.   If you have a craving for a burger there is simply no other option. Come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best elongated dog I had!! Party of 2  we ordered 1 burgr and my fresh roasted chilli dawg took about 40minutes to get served!!! Yes 40 minutes!!! Took the whole \"fresh\" literal. I guess worth the wait when you are not starving."}
{"text":"For a pretty hardcore watcher of Hells Kitchen I was excited to go to one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants when I decided to pack up and head out West for a trip to Las Vegas.  My guest and I for the last leg of our trip decided to play it on the touristy side which meant snag a drink and an appetizer then bounce out.  When we arrived we asked to sit at the bar which had an open kitchen view but unfortunately for us there was a wait. We opted for a hightop.  The app of choice was the Jalapeño Poppers and yes I know I know I know I get to try a Gordon Ramsey burger and I opt for Jalapeño Poppers I get it bite me! Anywho the jalapeño poppers were absolutely amazing I mean house made cheddar ranch dressing with hot sauce stuffed with applewood bacon. Shut yo mouth! Honestly the best jalapeño poppers I've ever had.  Hopefully the next time I find myself in Las Vegas I will definitely have a full on dining experience at this hip little bar and restaurant.  But seriously best damn jalapeño poppers"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome.   What I ordered: The Earth Burger (Vegetarian option) and Parmesan Truffle Fries.  Pros: - The restaurant uses technology effectively. The wait for me was suppose to be 45 mins for my group. We just give them our number and they will text when the table is ready. They give up your table within 10 mins of the text. I was quoted for a 45 min wait time, so I walked around and shopped, the text came early (within 25 mins) but I did not check till 10 mins later because I was in a dressing room. I came around 15-20 mins late but they still let us in and didn't give up our table.   - The drinks/desert menu is on an iPad. The response of the iPad is very slow, but still cool nonetheless.   - Customer survey in on an iPod  - The menu is simple. Straightforward with clear descriptions. Not too many items and not too few. It's not as long or complicated as some other high-end restaurants.   - Service is great. They read my mind every time I wanted more water. Very friendly, knew how to start conversations without being awkward.   - Portions are perfect. Quality over quantity. Except the fries. Fries were quality with quantity. They were delicious and I couldn't finish all of them.   Cons: - There were minor hiccups in service which were all natural human error, nothing egregious warranting dislike for service.  - One visit to this restaurant is going to want you to come back again. The taste of the burgers will randomly show up in your dreams or while you're walking to your car. Make sure you always have enough money saved up for a spontaneous Vegas trip."}
{"text":"All I can say is Aaaaamazing! Their long wait in line was worth it! The pace of the line was quick about 15-20 minute which was better than 30 or 45. They do their best to accommodate and make sure everyone is fed in fast manner. Their server is mostly men but their hostess are female which is pretty different. I love this place and wanted to order a to go because their burger was that good!!!  If you are searching for a tasty burger that is well seasoned and sauces that just tingle your mouth, this is a place to try! If you are on the saving side, probably wouldn't recommend it. Their burger prices range from 13-15 dollars and this is just for an average size burger without any sides. Their sides such as fries is an additional cost, so you'd be coughing out about 40-50 dollars depending how much you order and what items. But since I enjoy watching his shows, I wanted to give it shot and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"This is located in Planet Hollywood casino, fairly easy to find. It was a Sunday morning and we waited in line before it opened at 11am. As soon as it opened, they started seating everyone. Our waiter was really great and recommended some of their popular dishes. We started with the gooey fries. These were probably some of the best fries i have ever had, I could not stop eating them!! I definitely liked the fries better than the actual burger.   I got the Gordon burger ($20) which is not on the menu, and it did not completely \"wow\" me. It was good, but not the best burger i've ever had. I still prefer a 5 guys burger. However, the ingredients tasted extremely fresh. Unfortunately, I was unable to try at of the shakes or desserts. But I would like to try it next time.   Service was great!"}
{"text":"I came out to Las Vegas for a music festival called electric daisy carnival, a friend had told us that it's a must go now I'm here back in Brooklyn NY craving what is the greatest burger I have ever had the farm burger. If your in Vegas and you like burgers go here even if you don't like burgers go =)"}
{"text":"Sad to say, but my recent visit to BurGR was absolutely disappointing. It's less than a year since my previous visits to BurGR and I'm surprised how dramatically the quality has gone down. I've had great experiences the first couple of visits last year when the place just opened and raved about it to my friends. Finally got to try it and I'm mad at how bad the experience was for us. We came Mother's day weekend and I have no idea what was up w/ the restaurant that friday night.  We both got the hell's kitchen burger w/ a fried egg with added duck breast bacon and I had to get my burger recooked FOUR times. Even on the 4th try it still wasn't what I wanted and my friend's burger wasn't what he wanted either. The customer service was crap that night too compared to my previous visits. I ordered my burger medium, and 2 times it came out medium rare, the third try it came out practically well done & dry and they forgot the duck breast bacon, 4th try it came out medium well.  I got tired of sending it back to the kitchen to get it redone so just settled, plus I was getting full from eating the fries while waiting.  My friend ordered his burger medium rare and his came out very rare. Normally he is fine w/ rare things since we eat steak tartare and all, but this burger patty looked gross. There was like blood from the patty oozing on his plate. Seriously, it looked like all they did was throw the patty on the grill then flip it really quick and served it. He didn't even finish the burger, only took one bite and left it there. He didn't wanna send it back to the kitchen to have it redone 'cause he felt bad since mine had to be redone so many times! ALSO our whole table agreed that the patties didn't taste seasoned at all. I've had this burger many times before and seriously it did NOT taste like how it used to be. HOW DO YOU FORGET TO SEASON THE PATTY?!  In despite of all this, our waitress didn't even offer to comp the poorly made burgers. I was really sad that the burgers AND service aren't as good as my first couple of visits when they had first opened. Not sure if they had an off night, but I would think they'd be consistent w/ quality service and food. First impressions mean a lot and my friend was so disappointed he doesn't even think it's worth coming again to give them a second chance. The only good thing that night was the milkshake and fries."}
{"text":"Great burger place. Friendly staff, fun atmosphere. However, the prices are a little expensive, but that can be expected with Gordon Ramsey.  The staff really goes out of the way to be informative.   I loved the food. I've tried several menu items and all were really good. I really liked the the wings (both flavors), super easy to eat. The burger with jalapeño and avocado was delicious. A little spicy, but the avocado really complements the jalapeño. Best onion rings I've ever had. The curry ketchup gave the fries a unique taste. The sticky toffee pudding push pop dessert was seriously sinful and fun to eat.  I really like the tablet drink menu, super easy to use. The drinks are great."}
{"text":"I had been to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill and loved the Bangers and Mash  with Sticky Pudding for dessert. Here, it's gourmet burgers, specialty fries and beers that can compliment the meal. OK, I left off the jalapeños, but it was still a Hell's Kitchen Burger. I like the spicy ketchup for the fries because of the smokey taste. The burger was great. Only piece of advice for Gordon, coach the staff on what beers/ales compliment each burger. Yes, the beers on tap change. But the beers you order are their for a reason. Please open a restaurant in Orange County , California. If my suggestion could make you money, I'd love an autographed cookbook.....at least an autographed menu."}
{"text":"Was walking around Miracle Mile in Planet Hollywood. Saw the line and the thought how delicious a burger would sound.  CHANTER BURGR ($16) - Basically a mushroom with arugula burger - great presentation of the burger - large and looked delicious - the first bite wasn't as satisfying as I thought it would be - the burger itself wasn't too juicy and didn't have that strong of a flavor - the mushrooms and arugula added a bit more flavor but not enough to compensate for the meat - overall the burger was decent but didn't feel like the $16 was worth it  - I wasn't the only one that felt that way; a lady that was waiting at the slots next to be said she could get 5 burgers at Carl's Jr for the same price and would be a lot more satisfied! I wouldn't go that far but I could definitely get a better tasting burger at The Counter.  SWEET POTATO FRIES ($9) - topped with powdered sugar served with a honey aioli - they were a bit soggy but still delicious - I would still order again but I do like some sweet potatoes  SERVICE: decent but could be better. Initially the service was good. The waitress took my to-go order at the counter and gave me an estimated time of 25 minutes. After about 35 minutes I came back to check on my food and it still wasn't ready. It wasn't until the waitress went into the kitchen after I waited another 5 minutes that the food was done. I never got the text message, well because my food wasn't ready at the allotted time anyway.  ENVIRONMENT: Great. The outside of the restaurant is very modern and hip. Even the menus are awesome.There is a bar area and the main dining room area. Everyone seems so jovial and happy to be there. As you line up into the restaurant there is interactive menu as well as fake flames to make the food seem even more delicious.  Overall, I'm not taken aback by any of the 2 Gordon Ramsay (The London in West Hollywood and BurGR). The meals are decent but nothing that I would recommend people to. The burgers sound delicious on paper but aren't too special other than the great presentation. I would be coming back as I'm sure I can get other meals in Vegas at the same price and be completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had and best burgers on the strip! I'm very picky with my burgers but these are perfection! Everyone in my party of 8 were very happy with their meal. I loved it so much that I almost went there a second time during my trip to Vegas. I recommend getting the truffle parmesan fries with your burger..so good! I would also recommend the hummus and Maui onion rings for appetizers. The hummus is super fresh and unique tasting and the onion rings are to die for! Don't plan on being seated right away and they do not take reservations. You put your name in and they text you when your table is ready. In the mean time, you could walk around the miracle mile shops which are right next door or gamble a bit. The food is definitely work the wait!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are both Gordon Ramsay fans, and this was our first time eating at one of his restaurants. The food was delicious. It was cooked perfectly, and had generous portions. The milkshakes were amazing, as well. The onion rings were the best I've had in my life, but the french fries were average at best. The service was quite good, and our waitress checked on us more than once just to make sure everything was perfect. We couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. One other cool thing is that they will text you on your phone when your table is ready, so you don't have to hang around at the restaurant for an hour while waiting for you table."}
{"text":"AWESOME APPETIZERS & DESSERTS, OK BURGERS, TERRIBLE SERVICE, PRICY, LONG WAIT, WOULD NOT GO BACK.  Most burgers are $15.  Appetizers and desserts about $10-$15.  Farm burger - No flavor.  Was excited about the egg.  They cooked it medium so the yolk is runny, which I love.  Truffle parmesan fries - Awesome with black truffle flakes in the dipping sauce and on fries  Asian honey-pig bao bun - Fusion but good, totally different from authentic Taiwanese ones   Jalapeño poppers - Great, very spicy though  Caramel pudding and chocolate shake, Butterscotch pudding and banana shake, Chocolate hazelnut pudding and coffee shake - All great  2 push up pops of salted peanut ice cream - Like the peanut ice cream portion, the cake portion is very dry and bad tasting  Waitress - All pretty and spent their time on flirting instead of doing their job!  Asked for water 4 times, didn't get it until 1 hour later.  Wait - They don't take reservations. We were told the wait is an hour.  Didn't get seated until 1.5 hours.  Plus really slow and bad service, didn't eat until another hour later.  EPIC FAIL for a Gordon Ramsay place, especially when he always yells at others about bad services."}
{"text":"Don't be mislead they stop taking customers at 130 am even though they close at 2 am. Lady wouldn't even understand the traffic situation outside. Will not come here again."}
{"text":"Through no fault of Gordon Ramsay's, I had a very odd experience at Gordon Ramsay BurGR, and I will definitely have to give this restaurant another chance on another occasion.  It all began when we rolled up at about one p.m. on a Saturday. I was very much looking forward to trying this place as I am quite the connoisseur of delicious burgers and truffle fries. We stood in a very long line for a bit next to an elaborate fire display (not feelin' the fire, by the way, because it was about 120 degrees outside as is). The hostess eventually came around to take our names and told us that it would be about an hour wait.  \"That's no problem at all,\" thought we. \"We'll just head over to the bar to kill some time.\" Famous last words.  We headed deeper into the Planet Hollywood casino and found ourselves ordering up at Fat Tuesday. Not a wise decision. At all.  By the time we were seated at our Gordon Ramsay BurGR table, we were already crossing over from pleasantly buzzed to quite unintentionally intoxicated. Woe.  Still, we ordered two of the truffle parmesan fries for the table and a burger each. The fries ($11) were absolutely fantastic. The parmesan topping was fabulous, and the truffle aioli dipping sauce they were served with was to die for. Two orders were probably excessive on top of our already uneasy conditions, but they were certainly delicious enough.  The burgers took some time to come out, and unfortunately for me, I was no longer in the mood to feast upon my blue cheese burger ($14) when it was placed before me. From what I can recall, it was well-cooked and very tasty (albeit rather plain). Though \"gourmet,\" these burgers aren't very daring. They are simple burgers, average sized, and topped with typical add-ons. There is not much that makes them stand out.  But maybe I was just drunk. My apologies to Mr. Ramsay. I will have to give BurGR another shot -- this time after fewer shots."}
{"text":"Lobster shrimp burger amazing.  Lush and juicy.  The lobster was cooked perfectly into a wonderful party with pickled vegetables on top.  One of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  No hype here, no tourist trap.  Gordon put his name on a great restaurant.  You won't be let down, it's great food at a great value.    The backyard burger cooked medium was perfect.  With a little added mayonnaise, awesome !!!!  Gordon kudos on not using your good name to make a tourist trap like so many other celebrities. My family and I will definitely back.  Cheers to your great chefs who also made my daughter an amazing grilled cheese sandwich.   Job well done sir, I applaud the simple elegance you created here.  Thanks to all for their great customer service as well !!!!!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas and this place was a MUST to eat at.   FOOD: My fiancé and I shared the farm burger (Excellent and very juicy!), the truffle fries and the Maui onion rings! Everything we ordered tasted amazing and very flavorful.   SERVICE: We arrived at opening hour so we knew it wasn't at full peak time yet. Let's of servers standing around, but I'm sure later during the lunch hour they were all needed. Overall, good service! A definite must try!"}
{"text":"Well worth waiting in line while standing next to fire. Had the jalapeño poppers, fries, onion rings and burgers. All were great, but the burger was phenomenal."}
{"text":"When we arrived there was a short line that we expected. We were sat in little time maybe 30 min. Our waitress (Hilary)  makes a joke about she doesn't bite after her say to follow her. After we were sat we were told where the menus was with no explanation of what things are.Hilary went away for a few min after our drink orders. Hilary came back and took our food order and answered a couple questions about what was on the burgers. When she compared their signature burger to a western bacon cheeseburger i.e. Carl's Jr. or Hardee's I thought that we are at the wrong place. We ordered anyway the farm burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger.we were told it would take about 20 min.  About ten min later here came the drinks. I.e. One beer and one red wine. Ten min later burgers came out but hadn't seen Hilary. Food gone drinks empty with no water or liquid to wet my parched throat. I was getting irritated especially when I look over and Hilary is leaning on the front counter and not paying attention to her job."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 11:30, party of 2. We were expecting a line but we got seated right away. Ordered the Hells' Kitchen for myself and a chantranelle burger for my wife. Also had the onion rings and oreo shake to share. The HK burger was pretty good. A little spicy but overall a well balanced burger. my wife's burger however was not that great. She didn't care for the jam and arugula so without em the burger was dry and bland. Onion rings were good but but we had high expectations based on the reviews. The shake was also just ok. Didn't care for the creme Brule pudding part of it. The oreo part was really good though.  Service was fast and efficient. Would possibly go again to try the farm burger but will check out Holstein's before we do."}
{"text":"Prices are crazy good for Vegas food. This is a freaking  Ramsey restaurant at really affordable prices. The quality of the food is outstanding. By far the best burgers in Vegas . A must try.  Service was very attentive and the dogs are huge"}
{"text":"Updated:  After posting my last review, I was personally contacted by upper management from BurGR  asking me to provide more information on my experience.  The manager apologized and invited me to return to the restaurant.  After arranging a date and time, I arrived back with a friend and we were anxious to try the restaurant again.  When I arrived, the hostesses were actively assisting guests and they kept the line moving.  When I was greeted by a hostess, she informed me that the manager was not there yet and would ask him to find my table when he arrived.  Shortly thereafter, I was seated at a table  I also advised my server that I would like to speak with the manager. She reiterated the fact that he wasn't there but will ask him to come to the table when he arrived.  Meanwhile, she took our order.  After the appetizer arrived, the manager came to my table and introduced himself. He apologized several times and said that his goal was to meet me at the door and personally walk me in.  Unfortunately, due to an accident on the freeway, he was late. I know he wasn't lying, because I was stuck in the same jam.  The manager frequently checked back with us as well as the server.  Once again, the food was delicious, and cooked perfectly. The chicken wings were the best ever!    The manager told me when we were leaving that I can contact him at any time letting him know when I'm going to come back to the restaurant and he will ensure that I have a very good experience.    I really appreciate the fact that management took ownership of my initial problem and worked on a resolution.  This gained my trust back in the restaurant. He told me that Gordon Ramsey actually takes an active part in ensuring that this restaurants are up to the highest level of standards and that anything sub-par is unacceptable.  The only thing I wish that would have been done a little better is that when I asked the host to speak with the manager upon arriving, she should have expressed a little more concern. Although she contacted her GM, the GM didn't come out to speak with me nor an alternative manager.  I think the situation could have been handled a little better when I arrived. Nonetheless, I was happy with my dining experience and will frequent this place more often.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last week. Wait was an hr and a half so if you don't wanna wait forever get your name on the wait list early enough to have dinner at the time you desire. The hostesses were very nice and sat us at a great table. The menu isn't huge but it has exactly what you need for a burger place. Now this is a gourmet burger joint so if you're looking for something extra fatty and greasy this is not for you, although you can get a classic cheese burger. I went with the triple cheese burger which had a bunch of fancy white cheese on it. Really great. Be aware when you're ordering that fries do not come with the meal so you will need to order them on the side. After the meal we enjoyed some push ice cream pop. Cake and ice cream in a push pop. Simply the bomb. Overall great experience and friendly staff. Again plan ahead if you want to go to Ramsays novelty restaurant."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try on our first night in Vegas. Located in Planet Hollywood this restaurant boasts of a classy decor. There is a panel of fire burning at the entrance, hinting at the spicy flavors of the dishes, which I thought was a nice touch.   We sauntered in a little after mid-night and though the place was not too busy with several  empty tables, the hostesses quoted a 45 min wait time.  She also made a huge show of how busy they were when I brought the empty tables to her notice. We had put our names down & probably walked a few steps away...when...guess what?....our table was READY!! Talk about lack of communication between the staff!!  Our server was polite, but curt, not really interested in making us feel welcome or allowing us to settle down before waiting to know what our choices were or trying to herd us along our meal.It felt more like being in a diner where you get rushed to finish your meal so that someone else would take your table...Only this isn't a diner and I didn't really see a long line of people waiting to eat....disappointing!  The food was food! We got the creme brûlée( with a few other ingredients) milkshake, the Parmesan French fries, the chicken sliders, Euro burger and Hells's Kitchen burger.   The milkshake was decadent, the French fries...were just French fries with cheese... I don't know why people praised these fries in their reviews...I don't think is was anything to brag about. The Euro and the Hell's Kitchen burgers were good. I liked the Hell's Kitchen burger better. The burger meat was flavorful, succulent with a good amount of spicy. The show stopper of our meal,were the chicken sliders! OMG these were delicious! The cornflake coated chicken pieces were crunchy and the meat inside was  tender,spicy and totally mouthwatering!  Overall: The meal was great but the staff and their tardiness ruined this experience for us!"}
{"text":"There is a long wait but it is well worth it. I ordered the jalapeño poppers, pork burger, and the truffle Parmesan fries. Everything was absolutely amazing. Definitely some if the best food I've ever had. Finish everything off with an Oreo Shake!"}
{"text":"We got appetizer of pigs in blanket.  They are tiny!!!! Also fair tasting.  They didn't come out too hot.  Their fancy fries were delicious.  Huge portion.  Sorta gross but good. :).  Got the burger with jalapeños on it. Was pretty good.   Spicier than I though.  Ketchup isn't hienz and tastes Funny. NNot the best burger in vegas.  Wouldn't come back but wasn't bad."}
{"text":"We came here during a weekday. No wait. I ordered the hell's kitchen burger and hubby had the blue burger with truffle Parmesan fries to share. Burgers came out in less than 10 minutes. Mine came with lots of avocado and jalapeños. It wasn't very spicy. It was perfect. His had a bit too much blue cheese for my taste but he loved it. We ordered both burgers medium well. Meat was juicy and tasty. Buns were soft and fluffy. Overall,  a really good experience. A great burger joint to try out if in the area."}
{"text":"So it took a little bit to find this place, because when I went, there weren't any real good signs to find it. That's okay though, it wasn't that bad of a find.   So let's break down why I'm giving it only three stars instead of more....  My friend and I had two burgers between us, since it was our first time we asked for them to be cut in half so we could split both and try both! Great, they did that for us. We got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Britannia.   Hell's Kitchen Burger should have had jalapeno's but only one side did, mine, my friend didn't get to taste any jalapeno's at all so that was a bust. The meat of the burger was cooked perfectly, except the taste of it was very bland. I know what a good seasoned burger tastes like and this wasn't one. I was expecting a lot more from it and it fell a lot shorter than expectations. I can guarantee you if it was Gordon Ramsay that made the burger, it'd be exquisite but this was nothing but a shame on his name.   Onto the Britannia, I expected more from this burger as well. It felt like the layers on the burger were just separate layers, nothing came together and I suspect the meat was from the same batch that made the Hell's Kitchen Burger, because it was bland as well. I asked for medium well and got well medium rare. Serious disappointment and I felt sick from just looking at the burger.   The only saving grace was the Sweet Potato Fries that we got. Those were definitely one of the most delicious sweet potato fries. There's nothing really too special about them other than the taste....  We got two drinks, one for each of us. I got the Innis and Gunn beer, which was definitely one of the best beers I've had. It's a golden red beer which is rich, creamy, and smooth. I enjoyed it and picked it because it was something I hadn't tried yet and was told it was one of Gordon Ramsy's favorites, gave it a go and fell in love with it! The other drink that my friend got was the Green Tea Gin I believe, which tasted just like green tea and was surprisingly good.   The drink menu was also on an iPad! It was pretty fun to sit there and play with it a little while looking through the menu.   The overall service was great though, but I was told if someone was named in a bad review they would get fired. Not sure how true that is, but maybe something to keep in mind? It wasn't too fast or too slow, kind of how I expected since there were quite a bit of people there. The server was very helpful and full of fun information about some of the drinks on the menu and the menu itself.   I'll come back again to give this place another go because I'm hoping that my first experience was just a bad day or a fluke and wasn't represented of the place or Gordon Ramsy's name, but we shall see. I'll definitely keep you up to date on my next experience!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best burger place I've been to so far food-wise, but be warned: don't come here when you're starving because the wait (both for a table and then for the actual food to come) will probably make you faint.   The feel of Burgr is modern and minimalistic, but spacious and intimate enough. I came here with a group of five friends on a Sunday afternoon around 2pm. We were told that the wait would be about a little over an hour, and we were able to leave a phone number so as to be notified via text when our table was ready. The actual wait was about an hour and a half, but we were seated quickly and our drink and food orders taken soon after.   We waited ten minutes for our drink orders to come (all of us had just ordered water) and then another HOUR for our food to come. I understand that everything is freshly made and that a lot of care is put into the food, but an hour for six entrees and three sides? After watching Gordon Ramsay's hardcore antics on his shows, I had much different expectations for service in one of his restaurants. When the food did come though, it was definitely just as good as I expected.   Chanterelle Burger: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=GQgBbOObWxl4NMnr2AUQNQ#GQgBbOObWxl4NMnr2AUQNQ) This burger was grilled to a perfect medium rare and topped with fresh arugula, roasted chanterelles, and a sweet fig jam. All the components were well-cooked and complemented each other well, although I wish there had been more chanterelles (I think there were only two pieces) and that the fig jam was a tad less sweet.   Truffle fries: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=GQgBbOObWxl4NMnr2AUQNQ#vAwykqxeHJ6L9us0hwI6EQ) I love that these were thick-cut and fried to a crisp on the outside while still soft and mealy on the inside. They were served with two sauces on the side: one a variation of ketchup and the other a kind of tartar sauce (but with a few added spices I believe). Both were delicious with the piping hot fries.   Sweet potato fries: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=GQgBbOObWxl4NMnr2AUQNQ#whOTAAufI9XOoXYwTtCESQ) Hands down the best sweet potato fries I've ever had, piping hot and topped with heavenly powdered sugar. These also came with a canister of powdered sugar on the side as well as a kind of sweet syrup dip. I wasn't a big fan of the syrup because I felt like it overpowered the delicate flavor of the sweet potato, but I've never had sweet potato fries anywhere else that were sprinkled with powdered sugar, and it was just so ridiculously delicious.   Overall, this was a delicious meal, and I'd absolutely come back for the food. I hope the service won't take as long next time, but I'll come prepared just in case it does."}
{"text":"I came here in December a few days after it opened and  all I can say is that this is the only reason why I want to go back to Las Vegas! The jalepeno peppers were spicy (in a good way) and the truffle fries are crispy. If you're a fan of goat cheese, I recommend the Euro Burger. The service was excellent and even though the location is random, I really do like the environment.   I am totally craving their Euro Burger!"}
{"text":"What a delicious restaurant! I have to admit I went here a little while ago so I do not remember all the details. But what I do remember is:  + Delicious aioli on the fries and burgers (I asked for extra so I can put plenty on my burger) + the prices were SO reasonable for the stuff that you get + the specials were delicious-listen for them + all the burgers we got were HUGE and so yummy. We all had to cut our burgers in half to even tackle it. + Awesome other items on the menu besides burgers. + Brandon was our waiter and he was hands down, one of the best waiters I have ever encountered. He was so courteous, funny and accommodating. We never had an empty water glass or ever had to wait more than a minute for something we asked. He was flat out amazing.   I totally recommend this restaurant. Why pay such high prices for other fancy places when this place is affordable, brand name, and all around delicious??"}
{"text":"The service from our waiter was great. He was helpful and attentive. We waited 30 min after walking 30 from our hotel cuz we really wanted to try this place. The hosts were rude but I didn't care I just wanted food. The food came out fairly quick, however our burgers were just warm, not hot, so I wish the cheese was melted more, it would've made it more enjoyable. The jalapeño poppers are off the hook! This place is overpriced, $60 for two burgers an appetizer but it is Gordon Ramsay's restaurant AND it's in Vegas so I was expecting it. Although the food was good, I wasn't blown away. Also, I feel like the list of burgers was so small for a place called BurGR.... I might come back if we're nearby, but I think next time we will try Guy Fieri's place cuz at least they load your burgers up! Oh yeah, I almost forgot, my boyfriend asked to add bacon to his burger. When we got the bill, it said duck bacon. Lol the waiter could've at least told us.... plus not only that, it was $3 for two measly slices."}
{"text":"Everything was just average. Jalapeno poppers were average.  Hell's Kitchen burger was average and the shake gave me a stomach ache, but that's probably because it was just too much, it tasted good. The truffle fries were good as well."}
{"text":"Food is great. But when line is long their staff seating you expects you to \"help them out\" with extra tipping to get you seated faster. If you don't cough up money, expect the wait to be 1-2 hours on busy night cuz there are people that well.   Burger is perfectly balanced and food is awesome. Waiting staff is highly attentive. If they just sort out the seating problem bullshit it would be five stars."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! Staff was very friendly too. Wait time was pretty long tho, my only complain."}
{"text":"Simple Menu - Perfect execution. Been here both times I was in Vegas. Love this Place. Usually pretty busy so be prepared to wait in Queue unless you go in an odd timing.   Jalapeno Poppers, Chicken Wings,Onion Rings all are fantastic. Burgers are good too. Also must-try are the milkshakes. They are pretty rich so order 1 and share with the table :)"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait!! The food, service and drinks...excellent! Needless to say, it not your run-of-the-mill burger fry joint; a gourmet version to say the least, with a price tag to match :) Good show Chef Ramsay!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. While the first time was okay (3.5/5), it was terribly bad the second time I came here. The burger bread tasted pretty old and the meat would have tasted better if they would have used Costco's frozen meat. I only came here the second time because a few friends who never tried it out wanted to check it out for the hype. Would probably never come here again. There seem to be so many better burger places on the strip."}
{"text":"I had Hell's Kitchen Burger. It was simply brilliant. This place is well worth the hype and the wait.   Everything we ate was unique, innovative and tasted delicious. The sweet potato fries were nice - but man I can't wait to get my hands in the honey jalapeño mayo again. That was just amazing.   I also tried Shake #3. It was rich and had very silky smooth texture. Difficult to describe but highly recommended.   Every single thing we had was great, service was exceptional with friendly servers willing to spend time to help my vegetarian friends order customized burgers. So do not hesitate to go if you are vegetarian.  I know I will definitely be going next time I am in town."}
{"text":"The long line moved fairly quickly, and it was fine listening to the live band in the lounge. I had the uber cheeseburger which was tasty!! The onion rings were great!! Crunchy, and well seasoned. The dipping sauces were really good!! The farm burger was really good!! The Peroni on draught was a good match! Yet the iced tea was absolutely perfect!!! It even looked more thirst quenching than my beer!!! Great value, comfy seating. I'd go back!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a burger. Bit loud. Of course, don't like how the seats are a bit low, and the napkins are short as in portrait and in landscape. I ordered a Pork burger. With my own set of fries. Knowing it's for up to 2people. We'll see how it goes. Just finished my burger and fries. Wow. What a taste. The pork burger had a good juicy taste, while the fries with this sauce that's got a zing. \"MORE PLEASE!\" Is what I'm saying. Over all. Good job. I recommend if you're a tourist looking for a good burger place. Come here. And the hostess. Fine. Lol."}
{"text":"excellence food?excellence service?we ordered stardard dwag?gordon burger and orange cream soda.waiter  Jamie provided excellence service for us.Thanks. good memory"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely fantastic!!! My bf and I went back within 24 hours!!! The uber burger and the euro burger are soooo yummy!!!  I highly recommend medium cooked!  The garlic Parmesan fries were fresh and perfectly garnished.   However, as for the service... It was not up to standards Gordon Ramsey would approve of!!!   The first time we went within that 24 hours, we got a host that sneezed into his arm, didn't check if we needed any refills.  The second time my bf and I said, \"Let's give the place another try since the food was outstanding.\"  We understand that when a restaurant is full not all waiters can provide as much customer service. In fact, I loved how our waiter gave us an orange covered iPad to look over drinks and so forth.  What we didn't expect was the tablet didn't work well. This was something my bf and I wrote off since electronics can glitch.   However, when our waiter takes our order and doesn't even listen to our requests for drinks... Well you're not going to get a good tip.  The manager came to our table and was super nice. I wasn't going to make a fuss since I was already annoyed, but when the manager asked us how we were doing and if we're enjoying ourselves, we were very honest and told him that the food is fantastic and the chefs are very talented.  However, we also told the manager that our waiter was busy talking with 4 other waiters where they place orders and are in clear view of the public. It's one thing if the waiters are busy and need assistance with a tablet to cover more ground for orders, but it's another when the waiter hangs out and doesn't bring us our drinks.   I just wanted sugar for my ice tea and my bf wanted a whisky sour.   The waiter kept ignoring us numerous times!!!  I was actually surprised that the manager after checking in with us (who by the way was super nice), didn't offer a free drink or something for being so neglected by a waiter.  In essence, food was great and we'll be going back for more burgers, but we now know not to expect good customer service since the two times we went, were the two times the service sucked!!!  I 100% know Gordon Ramsey would have ripped the waiter a new one if he knew how negative the reviews continue to be for the customer service realm. Food-wise GR would be proud as he should be!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot and pretty cheap compared to the other restaurants in Vegas on the strip Burgers cost between $14-16 bucks and fries are $8-10 I think. Waiters are fast, food comes out fast and you're at Planet Hollywood. Eat Enjoy and come back"}
{"text":"The Hell's Kitchen burger is the bomb!! If you like spicy food, this has the perfect amount of heat on the burger as it has a roasted jalapeño on it. The beef is flavorful and cooked just how I liked it, medium. Definitely would get again but next time skip the onion brings and just get the truffle fries. The beer batter on the onion rings is super thick and soggy and there's a strong bitter aftertaste because of the beer."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Vegas my wife and I made it our goal to try multipe gourmet burger restaurants. So of course BurGR had to be one. After perusing the menu a while the waiter suggested an off menu item called the Ramsey burger. Along with the burger we had the Parmesan Truffle fries and the coockies & creme with creme brule' shake. The burger was nothing short of amazing. I can't begin to describe the duck breast bacon. The fries were beyond description I didnt believe the shake could compete but to my satisfaction it was excellent. We finished the meal off with two beers. To recap that was 1 burger, 1 shake, 1 order of fries and 2 beers 2 Tangerine Mojito's. I was startled to receive a nearly $100 bill. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing. The Ambiance was great, the service was everything I expected from a place branded by Gordon Ramsey. I will be back and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I ordered the Farm Burger which had the following:  duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar and a fried egg.  I really enjoyed the burger, but I would have preferred actual crispy pork bacon vs duck breast bacon.  I've never tried duck breast bacon so I ordered it to see if I'd like it and it was ok.  I also ordered the truffle parmesan fries because you had to order the fries separately which I'm not really of fan of at places, but the fries were DAMN GOOD!  The atmosphere was live and the service was great.  We did have to wait 20 minutes to get seated, but once we got seated, we got our orders in fairly quickly and our food and drinks soon thereafter.    Yes there were a couple things I didnt like, but overall I liked the food and service thus the 4 star rating.  The prices werent too bad either especially for a place on the strip.  Not to mention the name.  I thought it would be more expensive for sure."}
{"text":"Everyone in our party was pleased with their order! I had The Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Truffle Fries . If you're in Vegas I would recommend a trip. It's a little pricey every thing is al carter the burgers are at least $15.00 and fries start at $8.00 so be prepared and there was a wait, but it was so worth it. The staff was great and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Husband and I took our two kids for lunch. You can smell the yummy truffles the moment you step foot into the restaurant! Shakes were a combo milkshake and dessert all in one tall glass! Make sure you save room for the burgers. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was perfect!! Spicy kick but not too spicy. Kids each had the Euro and hubby had the Uber Cheese. Only complaint was that they couldn't finish them. Must, must, MUST order the truffle parmesan fries!! The sweet potato fries were also good but was not necessary after all the food came. Service was exceptional! Will definitely add this place to our list of \"must-go-to\" whenever we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Eh. Looks like food quality is going downhill. Came to Burgr right after it opened. The chicken burger was amazing. Melted in your mouth. I've been dreaming of that burger. Finally had a chance to come back. The same chicken burger I ordered was dry and flaky. Definitely not the same quality. Could I have idolized that burger setting an impossible standard to live up to? Maybe but the burger I ordered was not worth the gourmet price tag."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted a good sandwich for lunch and choose to eat here even though we try to avoid the celebrity restaurants.  The flames by the waiting line were a bit much for a 110 degree day in Vegas, we each had sweat dripping off our face for the 45 minute wait.  Once getting to the front of the line I finally asked the girl if we could eat at the open seats at the bar and she had to ask the people in front of us if they wanted to eat there first.  The bar tenders were nice, punctual with asking if we wanted a drink and gave us their recommendations for food, which we wanted instead of what was just \"popular\".  Drinks were good, the bartender even changed the channel for us to golf.  Onion rings were very tasty, my husbands burger was just ok along with my chicken sandwich. Kinda dull and dry, we both had to add condiments which at an establishment like this I was a little disappointed.  You can tell either Chef Gordan really cares or the GM cares about the \"nice looking\" staff because I noticed how the employees were all very good looking.  Lunch was pricy, plan on $100 for 2 people. It was a good lunch, but I don't need to return."}
{"text":"The line was ridiculous as it should be and it was worth it! From the atmosphere to the food. It was an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"My farm burger was perfection! One of the best burgers I've ever had. I thought this might be an overrated touristy place like Holstein's but that was not the case. I pregamed for the Britney show here, and I avoided a huge line by finding an empty seat at the bar. Had a great time. The beer battered maui onion rings were average, but the burger was too damn good to not give this five stars. Plus, good draft selection and good bartenders."}
{"text":"My favorite burgers in the universe!  Hells Kitchen burger is a mandatory every visit, then we usually share whatever the special is."}
{"text":"Live in Vegas and been to all the burger restaurants. This is the best. Tasty food and my picky wife loved the Ceasar Salad. Wait staff was terrific as was the manager Emily who took the time to ask us how everything was and to talk about Vegas restaurants. A must if your in Vegas."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5 stars.  I liked it!  I got the Chanterelle Burger ($16) and my date got the Hell's Kitchen Burger($14). I didn't like that it didn't come with fries.....all burgers should come with fries or some sort of side! :3. We got the truffle fries ($10).  My burger was good for the first several bites but then it started getting kind of dry. The flavor and patty was good. Same for the Hell's kitchen burger except with a kick from the jalapenos!   The truffle fries were pretty good! I'm not sure if it was $10-worth good but they give you quite a bit for 1 order so it is perfect when shared between two consumers.   Our burgers took it's time arriving to us. The table two feet to our left came in 10 minutes after us and got their food 15 minutes before us. =(  Overall it was pretty good. It was a good place to try at least once."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place a lot however the wait times are a bit ridiculous at an hour plus. I ordered the hog burger and between the other 5 people we were with we tried a lot of what Burger had to offer. Overall I was impressed but not blown away."}
{"text":"sorry GR, like your tv, dislike your food.    extremely disappointing.  truffle fries were good, jalapeno poppers just merely average.  i couldnt get over the cheddar cheese instead of cream cheese, just not as good of a combo.  friends had the farm burger and i had the hells kitchen burger... lacking in flavor.  the patty was a good size and had ok flavor, but the bun added absolutely nothing.  it looked nice, tasted like nothing.  for 14 bucks, i expect much better.  i would have much rather eaten at in-n-out."}
{"text":"Our group of 3 came two nights in a row, and both times they were fantastic. Service, atmosphere, food - everything was perfect and an amazing deal!  Both nights we went late at night, knowing there would be a lineup for dinner, but the lineup is still there at 10pm! So be prepared to wait at any point during the day because the restaurant is pretty much always packed!   We got the fish and crisp sandwich both nights - the tartar sauce is to die for and the fish is done perfectly, crispy on the outside and still so juicy on the inside. For someone who doesn't like/eat beef I'd say this is the best option. The other highlight were the sweet potato fries. Since we saw a bunch of people ordering them on the first night, we decided to give them a go on the second night. Definitely don't regret that at all! It comes with honey jalapeno mayo which honestly isn't spicy at all, even coming from someone who eats almost no spice at all.  Price-wise, this place is completely reasonable, if not a good deal. For excellent, gourmet burgers and an amazing environment, their prices and quality are definitely better than other a la carte restaurants in this and nearby hotels!   Service was great and the food came very quickly for such a busy and packed restaurant! I'd definitely recommend checking this place out (at least once) during a visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is obviously a big tourist attraction, and it works. The blue burger and \"just\" fries I got were nothing short of excellent! Service was good, too. We got lucky and did not have to wait in line to get inside, since we went on a Wednesday night.  One nice touch that was unique was that when you get the bill at the end, there is an iPhone inside asking you to complete a survey based on your experience. Somebody must have money if he can put an iPhone inside every bill holder!  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it is too loud inside. It's one of those restaurants where the music is played so loud that it's hard to hear your server or even have a conversation for that matter. However, I let them know about that in the survey, so at least they seem to care about customer feedback.  I would gladly come back to try another burger. Gordon Ramsay did well here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to have an early dinner before a show. This was our first time in Vegas and we were planning on going to all 3 of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. We were seated immediately as there was no line at that time. Our drink order was taken immediately and soon after our food order. That's where everything went down hill. Our server disappeared then another girl approached our table informing us she would be our server for the rest of the meal. Ok, no problem. Three tables who came after us received their appetizers and then their meals before us. We were annoyed so we attempted to flag down any server because we couldn't find ours. First problem, maybe there was a shift change happening, but there were at least 15 servers just standing by the computers talking. Eventually they disperse and we can see our server, but she and three other servers are laughing away with who appears to be the manager. We attempted to flag down other servers and even the manager, but no one stopped. We waited about 10 more minutes before our server approached our table and we informed her that we still haven't received our food. Her response was that it can take 20-30 minutes, but I politely let her know it's been well over 30 minutes since we ordered and other tables have received their food. She lets us know she'll check on it. When she comes back she says they made a mistake with my order and they had to re-fire it, that's why it's taking awhile. I found that interesting because I had an appetizer as a meal (honey pig bao buns), which is two small pieces of pork that I'm sure that could take 5-10 minutes to cook. When we finally received our food, it was AMAZING!!  After such a bad experience the first time, we decided to try one more time. This time we had to wait in line, but no more than 15 minutes. Our server this time around was excellent! He was very attentive and even informed us we could keep our menus (which we weren't informed of the first time). Our drinks and our food was served to us promptly (and we arrived at a busier time than the first). When we paid for our meal, the server also gave each of us a Gordon Ramsay Burgr pen for us to keep, again something that wasn't offered the first time.  The first experience I would rate 1 stars and only because of the food. But with the excellent service and food the second time I decided 3 stars would be fair."}
{"text":"Really 4 stars?   To be more realistic it's 2 stars at best. The service there is really good. But took more than 15 minutes for the food to come out.   Ordered the Gordon burger which is a fancy way of saying avocado burger and the fish and chips.   Burger was standard not \"Gordon Ramsay\" standard. The fish and chips was more like fish and crap. That had no taste and the best part was the shoe string sides that came with it.   Sweet potatoes were good and the vanilla dipping sauce was good.   This was a real disappointment and not to mention it was expensive.   Trust me there are better places out there. If you ever go to orange county try slayers 50/50 to get a better tasting burger."}
{"text":"MMMMmmm. Yummy burgers but VERY expensive! This is a high end burger place on the strip. Burgers are on average of $15 and fries/onions rings are a staggering $10! If the sides weren't so expensive, I would come back... but since the prices are so high, this is more of a \"try it once\" type of place.   I ordered the Farm Burger that came with duck breast bacon, cheddar cheese, and a fried egg for $15 and the truffle parmesan fries for $10. Those are the Total Rewards prices. Without the card, it's $1 more for each item. My friend ordered the hog burger for $17 beer battered maui onion rings for $8. Our total was about $53 for just the 2 of us... and we didn't even order drinks! That's pretty damn expensive for burgers.   I must say though, that the food tasted amazing! Everything was really tasty and well presented. It was our first ever experience at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Service was also quick and good. Food came out in a fairly timely manner. The food did taste just as good as it looked... but I've also been to other pretty fantastic burger places for about half the price! My egg on my farm buger oozed with yoke yumminess when I cut into the burger! It wasn't overly cheesy and all the ingredients went well together. The duck breast bacon was tasty and tender. My truffle fries came with 2 sauces, a garlic aloli and the other I can't remember. The fries were tasty but not good as leftovers. Onion rings were crispy and also very tasty, but also not good as leftovers. The food here is meant to be eaten fresh.  This burger place is located inside Planet Hollywood. It's at one of the entrances right off the strip. There is a fire display at the entrance - really cool looking! When we went, the line pretty long, but moved pretty quickly. Now that if you are a party of 2, you must wait in line. If you have a party of 3+, you can give the hostess your name and number and they will text you when your table is ready.   I'm glad I tried this place because it was really good, but chances are I won't be coming back because it's just too expensive! I was told by the guys at the table next to me that you can substitute the regular beef patty for a pork patty instead. I do not know how much that costs - but the pork is really tender and tasty - basically the kobe beef of pork.   So, try this place because it's really good and to claim that you've eaten at one of Gordon Ramsay's establishments... but not really worth the price - so it's more of a try it once type of place. I don't think I can stomach paying $25 bucks for a burger and fries again. Just remember to use a Total Rewards card to save and extra buck off each item and if you have a party of 2 or less, you have to wait in line!"}
{"text":"Ok.  This is going to be short and sweet.  Like me.  This was absolutely the best Burger I have had...ever.   Actually burgers...let me explain before you judge me! ;-)  My friend ordered the Euro and I ordered the Hell's Kitchen...then we split them.  To me, that is the best thing to do at a place you've never been before.    Burgers were cooked to perfection and the toppings did NOT overpower the flavor of the high quality beef they use.  Holy crap.  AMAZEBALLS!  Awesome drink selection as well.  Thanks Gordon!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had. Hands down! The farm burger. The flavor was absolutely incredible where you can taste more than just the meat and cheese and bun. There was something to it that was unique. Truffle fries were also amazing with the aioli sauce.  You can tell that a chef's planning and skill has gone into the food at this restaurant. Like a really good chef so definitely a place to go and try! The atmosphere was pretty nice too, and the service was decent.   Oh and the prices were pretty decent. Next time, I'll try the other burgers."}
{"text":"I was excited to try another GR restaurant in Vegas, but I was fairly disappointed. I tried one of their shakes first and I had to send it back (our server very graciously took it off the check)...a milkshake topped with room temp pudding sounded good on paper, but in reality it was terrible. The Hog burger was ok and my husband liked his Hell's Kitchen burger, but the parmesian truffle fries were the best part of the meal. I can't say I will be back to this one, but his steak restaurant at the Paris is amazing, so I'm still a GR fan."}
{"text":"I'm only giving the restaurant TWO stars and I haven't even made it inside yet! I'm sure the food is amazing... I watch Hell's Kitchen and I expect so much more from an establishment with the Gordon Ramsay name on it. When I approached the restaurant there was a long line outside. I walked to the front where the host stand was. There was a gentleman in front of me waiting to ask a question of the hostess. There were THREE hostesses standing there talking amongst themselves. They talked for approximately FIVE minutes without looking up once. They didn't acknowledge we were waiting in any way nor did they at least give us the \"I'll be with you in a minute\" look. Finally the tall blonde hostess assisted the gentleman then me. I advised I had a party of five. She advised I'd have to wait 45 minutes and told me to get in line.  I walked to the end of the line and waited 15 minutes to move through it to the front where a different hostess greeted me and asked me the size of my party. I advised her there were five of us. This hostess advised I'd have to wait 45 minutes, she took my name and number to text me when out table was ready. I asked why I had to wait 15 minutes to tell her the same thing I told the blonde. She said she had no idea. No apology. No customer service skills at all.  My $18 burger better be \"to die for\"..."}
{"text":"This place is sooooooo good! I had the uber burger with the truffle fries and my hubby had the euro burger and it was amaze balls! The bun they use on the burgers are sooo yummy and the taste and quality of their burger is absolutely delicious! I would definitely come back again. Worth every penny and worth the long wait in line :-)"}
{"text":"What a great burger place! Be prepared to wait in line, but know that it's worth it. I'm a huge carnivore and was so impressed. It has a \"badass\" vibe with a cool fire wall, totally appropriate vibe for a Gordon Ramsay. We ordered two cocktails (amazing, especial the jalapeño rita) two kinds of burgers and the most amazing fries (truffle and sweet potato). Everything was phenomenal! Definitely one of the best burgers I've had. Great place to eat at!"}
{"text":"Eat a snack before waiting line, because it could be a long wait.  Arrived at 7:00pm and finished dinner at approximately 9pm. Waiting an hour for a table to open up devoured a good portion of my evening. Now, if the burgers were better than what I was hoping, maybe waiting an hour wouldn't have mattered.  At first, we stood in line, but one of the hostesses approached us and asked for a number to reach us at when a table opened up. In an hour, they texted to tell us the table was ready, but only to tell us in-person that they were still cleaning up -- another 10 minute wait.   FOOD Hell's Kitchen Burger ($14): The title and the description imply that this burger has some heat to it. Definitely, does it pack some heat, but not at first. The jalapeños were centralized and not evenly distributed, so you don't taste the heat until you reach the middle. The burger's don't come with fries or any other kind of sides; you'll have to order those separately. Overall, this was just OK.   Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11): Fries were good, and the truffle aioli and homemade ketchup were excellent condiments.  SERVICE Slow, but understandable because there were plenty of diners on the evening I went, and there were plenty more coming in after I left. Despite the slowness, our waiter and even the managers still made time to check in with our table.  OVERALL Not impressed."}
{"text":"Took the family to eat here and the Gordon burger that isn't on the menu is the way to go!  Don't change the recommended temperature of the burger.  Medium was cooked perfect and was so juicy.  The truffle fries were awesome!  Overall a very good experience.  By the way, try the Belgium beer that have on draught....amazing."}
{"text":"We visited Gordon Ramsay Burger during a recent trip to Vegas. I have the Blue cheese burger with figgy jam with truffle fries. The food was great but the service wasn't on par for a Gordon Ramsay establishment. You see him on tv and wouldn't expect to see the inside of the restaurant to seem so low budget and the waiters uniforms were beyond horrible. Some of the waitresses had on dresses that ended right below their asses and the other uniform was tacky jeans with a Gordon Ramsay Burger patch on the back pocket. I understand it's a casual restaurant but there's something as too casual."}
{"text":"HUGE line - not worth the wait. overly greasy. overly priced - compared to taste. Go for the claim of fame of eating at a celebrity's restaurant. Come out disappointed, wanting to go eat some real food."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Food solid 4 stars. Definitely get the truffle fries - loaded with flavor! The truffle aioli is overkill in a good way!   Eye candy galore!!! The servers are all tightly packaged in their gray attire."}
{"text":"This place was exactly what I hoped it would be! We got the gooey fries and shared it between two of us and it was too much food. Would definitely recommend a smaller serving but it was all so delicious!"}
{"text":"Fine burger but the price: OUTRAGEOUS.  Fat burger down the street serves same quality for much less. You are paying for the name. It's not cooked by Gordon Ramsey.  The fries are good but again the price ???    I guess most folks eat here to show off or do a selfie for social media. Majority don't return like me."}
{"text":"Great place for a fabulous burger!  The onion rings are so good!  My husband and I shared the farm burger and the honey-pig bao buns.  The burger was cooked perfectly... Excellent quality ingredients.  The egg was perfect with a runny yolk, duck bacon... Whatever it was good... My only critique is the meat could've used a touch of salt... I'm not sure if it was seasoned.  The bao buns were Tasty! We went right at noon on a Tuesday and sat at the bar.  The lined formed shortly after we arrived.  Of all the burger places to choose from I'm glad we cam here!!"}
{"text":"BurGR is more hype then anything. Over 3k reviews but think about it...the area that it is in has TONS of foot traffic (Right by PH/Miracle Mile Shops and across from Cosmo). The huge open flame display is an eye catcher and Ramsay's name himself!  The burger itself is priced fairly for the Strip. Let me tell you though, the meat used is SUPER juicy and tender. The burgers themselves are on the small side but tasty. We had the Farm Burger (duck breast bacon / fried egg) and Euro (truffle aoili and WAY TOO MUCH goat cheese).   Other items we ordered:  Onion Rings - the order is HUGE..definitely enough for 3-4 people to share. They come with ranch and a chipotle ketchup.   Fries - burger prices DO NOT INCLUDE fries. The fries themselves are nothing special but the chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup they give you tastes super good.   Hummus Appetizer - If you want raw celery, cucumber, carrot sticks and GREEN ONION STALKS on a dish...order this haha. I felt like it was a plate of stuff I was going to juice. Very generic hummus, and the \"pita\" bread they give you actually resembles naan bread haha  Coffee Milkshake - My favorite part of the meal :)  SO WHY ONLY 3 STARS???  First of all, the wait-time...any busy night, you can expect to wait up to an hour to just sit down. Diamond/7-Star members get seated right away..you can also try tipping the hostess a couple dollars to get seated quicker as well.   And also because the burger is nothing SUPER special. Holsteins at the Cosmo or Burger Braissire at the Paris have great burgers as well...and they have a WAY shorter wait time as well!   Overall, it's a GOOD burger but I don't think it's worth the hassle.  Not a place I would wait 30+ min for, but before I got Diamond status...I had to wait for that long lol."}
{"text":"Is it possible for one of my favorite Burger restaurants to get better? Why yes it is!   I've been back at least 3-4 times since my initial amazing review and a recent experience gave me no choice but to update my review. I ordered a burger medium rare bordering on rare and when I bit into my burger it was clearly well done bordering on overcooked. Before I could open my mouth to say anything the chef took one look at my burger and took the plate away. He then apologized for the burger being overcooked and offered me a free side of fries or onion rings. He didn't need to do that but the attention to customer service is a huge plus for me. Oh yeah, and don't forget about Burgers and Boners!"}
{"text":"Totally a fan of burgers that don't need condiments.  Even though they serve frozen French fries."}
{"text":"Worse service ever! It's takes 15 mins to finally come to our table, only to say.. \"I'll be right back..\" This is ridiculous.. I wish I can like this place, but only their foods are pretty good. Their farm burgers are good as well as their jalapeño poppers. If they only learn how to up their service, this would be an issue. 3 stars for food only."}
{"text":"Came late on Christmas Evening and they were packed. Love that they will put you on a wait list and text you when your table is ready so your not stuck standing in line. We have been here a few times and each time we enjoyed our meal. Only downside last night was the truffle fries must have been sitting while our burgers were being cooked as they were hot but limp instead of crispy as usually. Also I did not dig the texture of the batter on the onion rings we ordered. Plus the sauce that came with them tasted \"off\". My fav here is the Farm Burger Rare-Med Rare. Hubby loves the Hells Burger. Don't forget to try the sticky toffee pops. Both kids and adults alike will love them. Plan to pay about $25pp as the burgers run $14-18 and fries for 2 run an extra $8-12. Service has always been excellent and the staff really knows how to work as a team."}
{"text":"Oreo Milkshake = Outstanding, best milkshake money can buy Jalapeno Poppers = Amazing, gorgeous presentation Truffle Fries = ok, nothing special Farm Burger (medium cooked) = *sigh* pretty dry, disappointed Hells Kitchen Burger (medium cooked) = meh same as above  Overall = C+"}
{"text":"Alex with glasses Luke sous chef  The line was insane, but if you have a small party you can get in quickly.  I saw a few large groups break up to save time.    Good beer selection on tap (sam adams cherry wheat? nice).  The jalapeño poppers were incredible, you must buy them if you go.  Tries a few sweet potato fries with powdered sugar, pretty good as well.  Had the hells kitchen burger, cooked perfectly and very delicious.  The bun was perfect for it.  Chatted with the sous chef Luke, great guy and he was doing a great job at the pass (insert gordon ramsay knowledge here).    Server was Alex with the glasses, very friendly and I was happy with the service.  I will surely return, and there was a lot more on the menu I wanted to try.  You won't be dissapointed in the food."}
{"text":"1st time there. had the Gordon burger...with duck breast bacon avocado butter lettuce"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is a must try dining experience if you are in the Las Vegas area!  I would recommend calling ahead though because the wait time for walk up reservations is ridiculous.... the burgers are good but not waiting an hour and 30 minutes for one.  That being said it is probably, in my opinion, top 3 Burger i've ever tasted in Las Vegas. unlike the line of people wrapped around the casino floor I made a reservation and was shown to a table promptly. Our server was polite, informative, and speedy when it came to initially starting our table.  The wings he recommended are amazing, just the right amount of kick and fit the appetizer bill to a T! (delicious but not overly filling) I went with the Hells Kitchen Burger for my main course, it has to be one of the most flavorful burgers i've had the fortune of tasting! So many different flavors then an delayed heat blast... wow! worth every penny!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to eat, what I'd hoped to be an amazing burger, inspired by the world famous chef Ramsey. But I thought the entire meal was mediocre and underwhelming.  We started with jalapeño poppers and onion rings. I will say it was the beat part of the meal. In fact the onion rings were the best thing I tried. Now, getting down to the burger business. It was a difficult decision. My girlfriend and I decided to split a Euro and the Homestyle. Both of our husband's went for the Hog. We all ordered them cooked to medium. There was no consistency in the temperature of the meat. The colors ranged from red to pink. The husbands both complained that the Hog had an Asian type of flavor going and were not impressed. I was afraid to eat my half of the Homestlye because it seemed undercooked. The Euro was OK, but still not mind blowingly good. Finally, the fries came with 2 kinds of \"fancy\" ketchup. They both tasted the same and chili powder was a main ingredient.   Also, reservations are not accepted so expect to wait a while for a table."}
{"text":"If not for the servers and the excessive cost this would be a 5 star review.  The burger I got was cooked to perfection, tasted fantastic and looked like a picture in a magazine when it arrived at the table. The truffle fries were awesome and the the provided sauces accompanied them well.  I did want to try another sauce but my waiter was too busy turning away customers and chatting up the waitresses.  The cost almost seems reasonable,  this exceptional burger comes in at around $13 but that is just the burger, want fries that is another $10+.  The fry thing would be OK if there were a group or at least another person to share them with, unfortunately, I was travelling alone so they added excessive cost considering I could only eat 1/4th of them.  If you want a great burger this is the place to come but you will need to deal with the cost and possible bad service."}
{"text":"awesome quick quality food*** I came here after seeing the Britney spears show. This place is a burgers hot dogs shakes kinda joint with amazing combinations. First of all even though it was very packed they handled the pressure gracefully and within a timely manner. Their chicken sliders (appetizer) are OUT of this world seriously the best chicken sliders i ever had  Their parmesan fries are perfection and their burgers are worth the hype. I was really upset that i was so full and couldn't try one of their hot dogs.. those things are huge and looked amazing. this place is a no brainer when your in vegas after drinking a little to much. its quick its easy its open late . Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. We had the one with the mushroom and the one with jalapeño.  Both were good. The sweet potato fries were good as well. 18 per burger"}
{"text":"I have to say I was not as impressed as other people on Yelp giving it 4 and 5 star reviews. I will say that it was good but by far not the best burger I've ever had. Also, to pay $60 for a burger, fish sandwich, fries and 2 sodas I felt I should have left amazed. Definitely didn't meet my expectations and my beautiful girlfriend agrees with me. I will say 3 stars....It was ok / good but not amazing."}
{"text":"Since I love Gordon Ramsay and always heard good reviews about this place. I decided to take my friend and I here to try it out. The line wait wasn't bad at all. I'd say we waited 20 mins max. The service is quick and the manager is fast about pushing people to clean tables. I got the blue burger with added truffle aioli. I love anything truffle. I also got the truffle fries. I was a little disappointed that the truffle fries didn't taste much like truffle. Still good though. My friend got the uber cheese burger. She said it tasted plain. It needed more of a flavor profile. But still was a juicy burger. She after got a chocolate shake which was good. Can't go wrong on a shake. The size portion is good. The service is great. Overall experience was wonderful."}
{"text":"I make this a must stop every single time I come to Vegas!! It never disappoints! I had the burger and it was delicious! Our sever was awesome and very polite. Anyone who is in Vegas must come here!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent burgers and the price is not altogether unreasonable for being right on the strip. Expect at least a 30 minute wait to get a table at dinner time, But the food is well worth it."}
{"text":"I loved it here. Service was impeccable as well as the food. We had the onion rings, truffle fries, and I had the euro burger. Our onion rings came out just a few moments before our food which seemed slightly rushed but wasn't a big deal at all. Our waitress came over and apologized for the late appetizer and proceeded to take it off our check. Great surprise! Especially considering it wasn't a big deal at all. Everyone was super friendly and the ambiance was great.   Our waitress told us Gordon himself had been in 2 times in the past 3 months which is a nice surprise and shows he cares. I figured his service and food would be good considering who he is and what he does but it definitely went above and beyond for me. What I think is the defining factor of a restaurant is whether or not I'd come back. Ill definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I ever tasted ... I had ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and the truffle fries sooooo good ! Service was great . Better get there early because it will be a line outside the door . Great experience . I will be going back :)"}
{"text":"I see so many 4-5 star reviews for this place, but after trying so many menu items, it has to be about the burgers and my experience was particularly bland.  One of my friends and his girlfriend were raving about this place, since they came the previous month and told me that I had to come try it for myself.  We had the following:  **Jalapeno Poppers: Now these are legitimately awesome, and would get them on their own.  Great taste, not to spicy and a perfect sauce.    **Fries (Truffle Parmesan/Sweet Potato/Regular): These were all delicious, as was their accompanying sauces.   **Hells Kitchen Burger: So shouldn't this be the main event?  I was anxiously awaiting some crazy taste bud exploding moment of ecstasy that never came.  The meat was bland, the cheese didn't have much of a taste and I never felt like I tasted the peppers.  I did get it medium, so I was surprised that it was so devoid of flavors.  What happened to this supposedly insane burger?  Service wasn't good.  After we ordered, the waiter mentioned that since the burgers taken 30-45 minutes to make, we might want to think about some appetizers.  Great, thanks for letting us know.  We ordered three (3) appetizers, and they came out about 25 minutes later.  3-4 minutes after that all our burgers came out.  So much for getting appetizers to hold us over for our meal. We all had suspicions that our tab was intentionally  raised, but whatever.    Since we had players cards, we had a small discount on the food, which amounted to about $20.  He forgot to apply it, and he said he would after he ran our credit/debit cards.  He \"forgot\" yet again, until I explained to him that he had not ran our players card discount.  He did finally corrected it, but after I spotted it twice.  My party felt like he was doing way too many things on \"purpose\" to forget to apply the discount.    The funny thing is that I did not want to say anything about my experience at BurGR with my friends since one of them really wanted us to go try it out.  It wasn't until we went to Fat Burger right before we were heading back home that two of my friends commented on how much better Fat Burger was than BurGR, at a fraction of the price.  And I completely agreed in not only cost but in flavor.  I might try it out again, since so many people rave about it.  But I may have to share a plate in case I am disappointed again."}
{"text":"It was okay. Nothing extraordinary. The meat was cooked perfectly, but the overall flavor of the burger wasn't anything memorable. The fries were hard and not very good. The jalapeno peppers were good. Honestly, I'd rather have eaten at Red Robin. They also serve Pepsi and not Coke products. I know that's not a big deal to some, but to me the quality of the drinks is important when enjoying my meal. The chairs are also really uncomfortably low to the ground. Every time I would see the server seat someone you could tell they couldn't get comfortable because of how low the chairs are.   Our waiter was nice and very knowledgable."}
{"text":"I honestly was disappointed with this place. I felt like the local mom and pop stores near my neighborhood had better burgers. The shakes were bomb, and that was the best part of the meal for me. The onion rings and fries were also just okay, but the sauces I thought were great,"}
{"text":"Quite possibly, the best burger I have ever eaten. Service is meh.....  But food is really great. Not a big menu; they called it BurGR for a reason. I went twice in 5 days-it's that yummy."}
{"text":"Farm burger was great. I got mine well done, hence the one missing star (I should've ordered it medium well). Overall the burger was like no other."}
{"text":"Burger was good. Not mindblowingly amazing but definitely \"good\". Now the truffle fries were \"GREAT.\" Don't forget to get it.  Had to wait over an hour to get in for dinner around 5PM on a Sat. The wait wouldn't have been as bad if they had told us it would be an hour instead of 30 min...  Went with a group of friends but overall a good experience.  Good to take friends, date, coworkers, family, and customers"}
{"text":"When in Vegas, splurge a bit because... Vegas.  My friends really wanted to try this place out, so here we go.  The prices for the burgers aren't too bad, somewhere between 12-16 bucks like any other high end burger joints.  The burgers here are pretty bomb.  I got the Chanterelle Burger.  I liked it a lot and the meat was cooked just right for medium rare.  The Truffle Fries were great and the Creme Brulee Oreo Milkshake wasn't all that bad.  The shake might have been a bit too sweet for me though (personal preferences).    And you could totally try different burgers by cutting and exchanging your burger with friends.  Trying different burgers for the price of one. Yay.   Anyway, great quality of food and wonderful costumer service."}
{"text":"Love Ramsey. However never eating here again after being told they cannot accommodate for a table of 9 while they had plenty of space and tables to seat us. They even had a table of 8 eating at the time, they said the extra person is a fire hazard?  I guess pulling a 2 top next to the 8 top is physically impossible. Rude hostess, embarrassing situation. was not handled professionally, especially for the way Gordon would have handled it."}
{"text":"The best burgers in the world!!  Love the fries, the chicken wings, The shake is OH LA LA!!  Cant wait to go back again in June."}
{"text":"How it's done right. Our busboy looks like a Chippendale. He can wait on my table anytime. :-) Our server is so hot she could set a stripper pole on fire. Prices are not prohibitive. $15 for a gourmet burger on the strip is what I mean. Loud music and swanky decor make you forget you are part of the 98%. Tables set aside for VIPs. Skip the line if you are a Platinum Rewards level member. Santa Maria! The #1 shake can send you into a sugar coma. Make sure you order it! Ditch the onions rings and go for the truffle fries. The blue cheese dip it comes with is to DIE for. Hell's Kitchen Burger is over-rated. Go for the Chanterelle Burger with Fontina cheese added. Slather some of that blue cheese dressing from the truffle fries and you can die a happy man (or woman).  The wait outside is worth it. Don't miss this."}
{"text":"I want to say it was delicious but the fish burger I got was more like a bread burger... The fish crust was quite outstanding but hard to taste with so much bread. I think there should have been a bigger portion of fish for sure.. Or a much smaller portion of bread."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Very happy with my burger. The place was super crowd but the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner around 6:30-7PM. Short line for parties of 2 so we were able to get seated in about 20 minutes.  We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, the Farm Burger, Truffle Parmesan Fries and the  Shake #5. Everything, especially the fries and shake, were so so so yummy! I would definitely recommend coming here for a casual dinner in Vegas.  Minus 1 start because it took awhile to get our food after we ordered."}
{"text":"Omg, the burgers here are DELICIOUS. This is definitely a MUST try. The only reason it got one star was because the hostess was little ms. snooty pants. Our waitress and the food were top notch though. All in all, pricey, but delicious.   Oh, expect a longer wait if its a party of 2. Thankfully, it was 4 of us and we were seated within 10 minutes on a Wednesday night."}
{"text":"I almost didn't get to eat here because my husband \"wasn't hungry\" but I managed to persuade him. After a bit of a line which this place always seems to have, we were seated. When our waiter took our orders he was great but after that we never saw him. I had overheard they were short staffed and slammed with people that night but bad service is bad service.  What redeemed this place was the food. My god my burger was incredible! I got the uber cheese burger and the cheese combo was unlike anything I ever tasted. You dont need any condiments with this burger, just the meat and the cheesy goodness. My husband got the American burger which he claims is the best burger he'd ever had. Both our burgers were supposed to be medium but there was a ton of pink which was a little off putting but not enough to stop me from devouring it.  I noticed that along with our order, it took most people 45 minutes to get their food. Then it was a struggle just to get the check. I love the food and would give this place another go, but the service needs improvement."}
{"text":"We waited a little over an hour for a table - and I am not 100% sure the wait was totally worth it.  At least I can say I went! What I can say is the staff was amazing!   I give RAVE reviews to the truffle fries, though they could have had a little more truffle salt!  The Fury Wings (a new take on chicken wings) were amazing.  They should serve them with the cheddar ranch they serve the jalapeño poppers with.  Wish I could have tried the poppers, but I don't eat bacon (they should offer without) but my husband said they were amazing! As for the Burgr's - not 100% sure they are worth the money.  Thankfully they offer a fish sandwich and a chicken burger, since I don't eat beef.  The patties were juicy and cooked perfectly - just think fries should come WITH a burger - between just fries & truffle fries we spent $19 on just fries! The experience of dining at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant was fun - but not sure I would rush to get back here again!"}
{"text":"Truffle fries and sweet potatoes fries were okay. Onion rings was delicious!! Burgers were great! It was \"you get what you're paying for\" and they have the best shake I ever had!!   Service is kinda inattentive... we had to remind them three time about our fries order.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The wait was slight, the food was amazing. Our only problem was our service. Our server wasn't impolite just not very friendly. Other servers seem to enjoy being there and the customers. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"As a fan of Gordon Ramsay, to me this place does live up to the hype!  You can say this place was built for tourists and conventioneers, but damnit, it is good!  After seeing BurGR featured on Master Chef in a challenge, I was keen on checking this place out on my next visit to Las Vegas.  My gf and I arrived on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon to a short line up.  We took a gander at the amazing flaming signage of BurGR inside Planet Hollywood. Within 10 minutes, we were promptly seated.  Our server Brandon was very welcoming and friendly, making us feel at ease.  Throughout the lunch service, he regularly checked in on us and made sure our waters were refilled. He also recommended a great beer pairing with my burger.   Since my gf loves ice tea (the kind you get in Canada), Brandon was aware that Las Vegas didn't have it so he had the bar made up something similar that more than met her standards for a great lemony iced tea, which made her very happy!   I had the Farm burger while she had the Euro burger.  Cooked to medium rare, the burgers were juicy and melt in your mouth.  Balanced perfectly, my Farm burger's duck bacon and fried egg, more than complimented the flavors of the juicy beef patty.  The Euro burger according to her could have used a little less blue cheese, but nevertheless she thought it was amazing still with arugula!  The burger buns were fluffy and crisp, as were the fantastic truffle fries, whose portions were more than enough to share for two persons!

{"text":"Amazing Burgers! Obviously. When my husband and I go here we usually get one of two Burgers the farm burger or the hells kitchen burger. The farm burger has a fried egg on top with crispy duck breast bacon. We order it cooked to medium and boy is it juicy and delicious! By far one of the best Burgers I've eaten... In my life! We have also had the jalapeño poppers which are super tasty but watch out at least one per order is like the blazes of hell. Dude to me getting the hottest popper once I ended up getting the sticky toffee pop.. It was the bomb and also helped cool my mouth from the intense heat. The French fries are very good too, but the best fries are the sweet potato ones! They have some sort of sweet maple dip or something and it's just amazing! Love this place can't wait until the next time we hit it up!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to try one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants while we were in Las Vegas and he likes burger, so BurGR was the perfect choice! I read on MTLblog that BurGR is \"the only burger restaurant on the Strip to cook over an open flame\".  I arrived at BurGr at 11:00 AM when they just opened and there was already a long line-up. Twenty minutes later, the restaurant was already halfway full! When the restaurant is full, the hostess will divide the line into two; one line is for the people less than 3 and the other line is for the people more than 3. I have the impression that the line with people less than 3 gets seated faster! We finally got our seats at around 1 pm, the wait was pretty long outside, what we didn't know was the wait for the food was even longer!!  We were seated at the very back of the restaurant and it was the casino behind us. I didn't really like the fact that I can feel people walking behind me since there wasn't a wall or anything that separated us, the customers, from the other people (there was only a wooden fence-like separator between the restaurant and the casino alley).    We ordered their Truffle Parmesan Fries (hand-cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aïoli). I got to say, this was the best fries I've ever had!!! I can't even describe how yummy this was!!! The fries didn't even need the dips since they were already very tasteful, but it came with homemade ketchup and truffle aioli. The truffle aioli dip had a sour taste, which went well with the fries but personally, I prefer the fries without any dips! The fries were also very crispy (even when they got cold)! The strong parmesan flavor makes the fries even more delicious!! I would definitely order this if I get the chance to go back again!  I ordered the Chanterelle Burger (chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, figgy-onion jam) because I've always love having mushrooms in my burger. My burger was pretty good, it has a sweeter side because of the onion jam, but it balanced well with the saltiness of the beef patty! The wild mushrooms were really good (very flavourful). My boyfriend liked my burger but I like his Farm Burger more. It contained duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, fried egg. His burger was juicy and the bacon made the burger smelled so good from afar! I really liked the addition of fried egg which balanced out the saltiness of the duck breast bacon.  My boyfriend's parents got their Southern Yardbird Burger (Chicken burger, sharp cheddar, mustard bbq sauce, pickle, butter lettuce) and if I am not wrong, the Britannia Burger (English sharp cheddar, mango chutney, arugula). I only tried the Southern Yardbird Burger, which was a chicken burger. The chicken patty was lighter than the beef patty and it felt like it was a healthier choice of burger! The whole burger was once again very juicy, the lettuce balanced well with the rest of the burger and added freshness too! The chicken was really tender as well.  I guess you need to wait for the good food because we waiter for more than 1 hour and a half, almost 2 hours for our burgers after we have placed our order. This is quite insane.. If you are starving, this waiting time will not be pleasant for you and I would suggest you to get something else instead (but make sure to come back another time). Or to eat something before you come since the waiting time (both outside and inside the restaurant) is quite long. I was really hungry since I didn't have breakfast and I was not pleased with the waiting time but their burger was worth the wait! High quality burger and their truffle parmesan fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Ate here on our last day in Vegas and we sure are glad we did.  The waiter we had was extremely knowledgeable in the menu and pretty much ordered for us because we couldn't decide... and we're so glad he did.  First the onion rings came out, and oh man.  They were good.  And the cheddar ranch? To die for.  It was gone in less than a minute.  Also ordered some fries that were great.  I had the farm burger and it was delicious.  DON'T THINK THE PORTIONS WILL BE HUGE.  They aren't, just normal size.  If there was any disappointment to my experience it would have been that.  But it's not Hash House A Go-Go, and I was definitely full afterwards.  And the presentation of the whole place was great, felt pretty fancy eating there."}
{"text":"I must admit I came with high expectations, but I should if I am paying $16 for a hamburger, just a burger no fries, no sides.  I had the truffle parmesan (garlic)  fries, which had little flavor considering the bold ingredients melded with the fries.   The farm burger sounded amazing, but the flavors never developed. The pub was cold and dry, the duck breast bacon was great, but when it was on the burger the flavor was lost.   The service was bad as well. I sat at the bar, and the guy helping me was more concerned about picking up on a female bar tender than helping any of the customers. He was also really rude to the guy sitting next to me because the guy did not speak good English and was having trouble ordering. I love Gordon Ramsay's other establishments, but this one is totally not worth a visit.   If you ever come to LA and want to have an amazing burger, try the Dog Haus' Little Mule and you will find true heaven. Burgr is closer to a meal from hell..."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in town for his 30th birthday bash, and we pretty much did an unplanned Gordon Ramsay food tour. This place was my favorite out of them all. Two dishes that stood out to me were their truffled burger and fish and chip sandwich. The truffled burger tasted as delicious as it smelled. And their fish and chip was not your typical plain battered fish, it was perfectly crunchy and flavorful.   The best I had all weekend!"}
{"text":"The pudding shakes alone make the line, long wait, and price worth it! I went here Labor Day weekend with the hubs twice! Saturday we came around 1pm and there was a 1 hour wait. You need to check in with the hostess and leave your cell number where they can text you. WARNING: that system isn't fool proof meaning you might NEVER get notified. We were told our wait was going to be 45min to an hour. After 45 minutes and no text I checked with the hostess that originally took our names to see how much longer. Well she couldn't find our names on her list? She went to the main hostess and she couldn't find it either. She remembered that I was there earlier. Obviously I had a less than pleased look on my face so they seated us next. But anyhow aside from that service was great and the shakes even better. I'll sum up what we ordered on both days. Difference: Wait was a lot less shorter by showing up when they opened at 11am on Sunday. I was dying to try shake #4 Oreo so that's why we went back.  Wings: flavor is great with a spicy kick. Husband really liked it and the portions were decent.  Pork belly buns: these were soft and most with a sweet flavor to the pork belly making almost like. BBQ type appetizer.   Blue burger: this was just ok. The blue cheese is stronger than what I was normally used to and that's why it had a very distinct flavor along with the arugla. I wouldn't order this one again bc it was just ok.  Hells Burger: this has tons of flavor and was really good. I'm not a fan of avocado but if you are this burger is for you. I would order this again just without the avocado.   Parmesan Fries: good with the aioli dipping sauce. But I think the fries themselves are dry. Would not order this again.    Now on to the best part and why I would come back here.  Coffee shake: the coffee shake portion of this is amazing! It's like sipping a mocha mudslide.  Oreo shake: amazing creme brûlée pudding and if you're an Oreo fan this does the trick  I'm a sucker for desserts and the concoction of gourmet pudding with shakes is brilliant!  Lol   Use your total rewards card for a $1 off menu items."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre for me. However, i did enjoy the onion rings. I have tasted better burgers in my opinion, and service was just okay for me."}
{"text":"Not the best burger I've ever had but definitely one of the best burger combinations I've ever had.  Fury Chicken Wings - meaty but unimpressive..my least favorite of everything we ordered  Honey Pig Bao Buns (2 pieces) - really good but could use kimchi or something pickled. The pork belly was done really well..melt in your mouth savory awesomeness!  Britannia Burger - the quality of the meat is really good and the burger is seasoned quite well. I loved the contrast of the mango chutney with the burger...sweet and savory is my favorite combination! What bummed me out the most was the bun choice.... The bread was a bit dry and didn't add very much to the burger.   Strawberry Shake - tasty, not too sweet but incredibly thick.   Truffle Parmesan Fries - the best thing we had here. Parmesan and garlicky....with homemade ketchup that's not processed tasting and a well balanced truffle aioli. I could have eaten just this and been perfectly happy  I don't know if I'd come back because $13-$14 for my burger was not worth it."}
{"text":"I'm not one for gimmicks, and I tend to avoid the Planet Hollywood hotel at all costs whenever I'm in town. It's not really the casino itself - it's just ... I try to keep my distance from Britney Spears in any medium, and that building-sized banner of her certainly qualifies. Wait a minute! THAT explains why the Miracle Mile Mall smells like bus stop and failure! Mystery solved!  Still, as fate would have it, we found ourselves meat-hungry and within sight of Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. Man, that just sounds so dirty. Well, at least it isn't Britney's Burgr. ::Gasp::  Anyway, I quickly scanned the reviews and many had mentioned the ridiculous standard wait times to get seated. Well, there was almost no line at the time, so we hopped in. I'm glad we did, because this place was great.  Is it overpriced? Yes. It's Vegas - get over it. Does it do burgers and pretty much only burgers? Yes. And as the rule stands, if that's all you do, it better be outstanding. And it is. I'm happy to say it is. The best thing about the burgers here is the BUN. Stay with me. Too many burger joints make the mistake of garlic buttering and toasting the bun, making the burger appear more substantial but all but ruining the actually eating process. Plus, I'm paying for the burger, not the bun. At Burgr, the bun is exceptionally light. It's like eating air. It holds the accoutrements in place and keeps down the mess but enables an easier bite. This is an extremely functional - and tasty - burger, and one of the best I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Fries with chiptole sauce is good"}
{"text":"This was NOT what I envisioned. . The restaurant is filled with beautiful people and the food coming out looks spectacular but 18.00 for a hamburger (added egg) that tastes ok is just too rich for my blood.   I would happily pay 23.00 for a burger that is spectacular.  I also was looking forward to the pork belly burger which I had seen on yelp but was not on the menu.  That is  my fault for not inquiring about it when the waiter asked if we had any questions.  In the end, it was good just not for the price.  The uber burger was crazy salty , not from the cheese..like literally I tasted salt granules."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a basic burger made to PERFECTION, Ramsay's Burgr delivers.  Hubby and I visited last year when we went to Vegas.  I wasn't a yelper at that time, so that's the reason the review comes so late.  My only two complaints was it's difficult to find and the seating is very close together so you feel like you are eating with your neighbors.  Other than that though, our experience was fantastic!  We had the blue cheese burger and I think hubby had a regular cheese burger plus sweet potato fries.  Those fries and burgers were TO DIE FOR!!!!  Juicy, perfectly cooked, lots of flavor, and excellent service.  It does get pretty busy, even during non-peak time we had a short wait.  We also had to wait a bit for our food.  Well worth the wait though.  We watch Master Chef and Kitchen Nightmares.  Ramsay is always talking about the importance of being able to make a basic burger right.  He knows his stuff!!!  The menu is pretty small.  Just burgers, but as Ramsay always says a good restaurant has a small menu because it's important to do a few things really well.  If you are a burger lover, it's a must visit when you are in Vegas.  We will definitely visit again when and if we return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that the truffle fries were to die for. The duck burger was out of this world. Unbelievable!   However, one complaint.. The all pork burger was far too sweet. Needed something.. Not Apple butter.. to decrease the sweetness.."}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Dining here feels similar to sitting on a conveyor belt at a factory slathered with the name Gordon Ramsey. The place is loud and packed, to the point that my friends and I could barely hear each other.  Service was paltry. I sent my cocktail back. The fries were soggy. It's nothing new, nothing special, and overall not worth it."}
{"text":"One of the BEST places to eat at in Vegas! Sure, you're going to pay quite a bit for just a burger... but I kid you not - these are not JUST burgers, but GOURMET burgers. We tried both the Hell's Kitchen burger, which had a nice spicy kick to it, and the Farm Burger, which is a must - the fried egg and duck breast bacon really make this burger!!! The truffle fries are also amazing - they have just the right amount of flavor, aren't too salty, and have a great texture. I also love the ambiance, especially the flames at the front entrance! Chef Ramsay really lives up to his critically discriminating nature because the food here is truly bomb!"}
{"text":"Excellent to be only burgers!! I tried the chicken wings, the sweet potatoes with vanilla powder, the euro burger and the chanterelle burger!! The best one was the euro Burger as it includes duck bacon, fried egg...try it!!! For dessert get the creme brûlée shake...hmm!! I have to say that my girlfriend was unhappy with the extremely short dresses that the waitresses were wearing..."}
{"text":"I've never devoured a burger so fast in my life! Everything on the burger was perfect even for someone who hates onions they were good! If you're a picky eater don't you dare take anything off the burger. They are made with all those ingredients for a reason. However, (bum bum bummm) the fries were dry and not that tasty! So I'd recommend not getting fries. Other than that it was a great experience and you should at least go once, You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I came here for Restaurant Week - Spring 2013. It was a great value for $20.13 considering I got a burger, fries, and dessert. I went with the Euro burger. The bun was perfectly light and crispy, proportion of meat to bun to toppings was excellent as well. The patty was well seasoned and not too dense. The goat cheese wasn't overpowering and the roasted tomatoes gave it a touch of sweetness and acidity, with the arugula adding the right amount of bitterness to balance everything out.  The wife got the chantrelle burger protein-style (without the bun for those not familiar with the In-N-Out lingo). I was too busy chowing down on mine to try hers. She seemed happy with it.  The thick cut parmesan fries were a little limp and not as crispy as fries should be. On the plus side there was enough fries for 3 or 4 people to share. The onion rings were lightly battered and as good as any you'll find in town.  The push pop for dessert doesn't do Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding justice. It's not even close to being as amazing as the warm version found at Gordon Ramsay Steak. The cold temperature made it too firm and crumbly. The peanut ice cream didn't add much either with its mild flavor and lack of creaminess.  On the bright side, our server Tabitha was very good. Knowledgeable, attentive, and efficient, she made the dining experience great. Although, she did make a mistake with my friend's check, who was dining with us."}
{"text":"This was great!  My boyfriend I ate here for lunch. We waited about 10 minutes. Not bad. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. She was sure to show us the size of the fries before ordering (1 order is PLENTY for two people). I love when they are helpful so that too much food isn't ordered unnecessarily.   Food-  I had the Euro burger. Delish!  I had it medium cooked and it had goat cheese, roasted tomatoes, aioli, arugula on a sesame seed bun. My only issue was the bun. I found it a little dry but the burger was so good it made up for that. My boyfriend got a burger with just cheese and duck bacon. He liked it and said the duck bacon tasted like normal bacon. We ordered the Parmesan truffle fries. Our waitress brought out the wrong fries, the regular ones. Once I brought it to her attention she was super nice told us to snack on the wrong fries until ours comes out. Fries - I wanted to like these. I'm not a fan of steak cut fries and was also surprised they weren't crispy. The aioli dipping sauce on the side was awesome but I would overall say fries were \"ok\".   Good burger place for Vegas. Decent prices. Maybe next time I'll try a different side."}
{"text":"I went to BurGR with some co-workers.  I had the Chanterelle burger and I LOVED it!  The fig and onions on it were so good.  My co-wokers had the Hell's Kitchen burgers and they said they really liked it them.  I really liked the truffle parmesan fries and I highly recommend that you get them. YUMMY!  We also had the jalapeno poppers, we all loved them.  We all like spicy food so none of us knew if we got the japapeno with the seeds because we are use to spice.  I also recommend trying these the dipping sauce for them is really good.  The last thing we ordered was the sticky toffee pudding pops.  I'm not a big desert person but after reading everyone's reviews on them we had to try them.  They were DE-LISH!  I thought the service was great but I really wish they would take reservations.  Our wait was 45 minutes so it wasn't to bad.  I really recommend coming here because its a great atmosphere, food is great, and good service."}
{"text":"So my hubby and I have been talking about visiting Burgr for 3+ years. We finally got around to going and it was soooo worth the wait.   The staff was lovely and efficient. The atmosphere was lively but not overwhelming.   The decor was tasteful and the flames along the restaurant really added a nice Vegas touch.   So, how was the food?  AMAZING!  I had the blue burger which was cooked to perfection and had a perfect balance of meat and blue cheese. I couldn't finish it all but I have dreams about that burger still.   The very best part of my visit was the gooey fries. I literally could not stop eating them. The fries had a perfect crispness to them, the cheese was phenomenal, the salami was a nice savory touch and the over easy egg on top was the crowning glory.   I would eat at this restaurant for my whole vacation if I could.   Best burger in Vegas, best fries in the country. Hands down. Order the gooey fries or you're missing out!!"}
{"text":"We have really enjoyed other Ramsay restaurants. The wait for BurGR is just ridiculous! We were told it would be a 2 hour wait and they would let us know by text (they text your phone) when the table was ready. I'm not much of a burger eater and rarely order them anywhere, but with Ramsay having his name on the restaurant must mean it's going to be worth the 2 hour wait right? Wong! When I first heard how long the wait would be, I wasn't even upset. I had been wanting to try BurGR and with a wait time like that I got more excited to try one of these well loved burgers. One thing is they have strict rules here at BurGR. When we got the text alert that our table was ready, some of us needed to use the restroom on our way back to the restaurant. Now we were on the property, never left. The hostess still refused to seat anybody until everybody was there and accounted for. Really? it seemed like we were on a field trip and the bus driver was counting heads to make sure everyone was on the bus.  Once we got seated it took 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and he took our appetizer order, but not our food order. He literally took off after we said what app we wanted. Around 15 minutes later our \"Roasted Jalapeno Poppers\" priced at $12 showed up at the table. They looked so good!!! Too bad they didn't live up to what I saw. The insides were still cold. It was only hot on the outside and the poppers were a real disappointment to our whole table. The cheddar ranch that comes with it just tasted like regular ranch. The poppers come in shot glasses with the ranch and we still had one left on the table that nobody really wanted. 20 minutes later our server came back to take our dinner order. Phew it was some wait time from beginning to finish at this place! Hubby and I decided to split a burger and a hot dog and the fries and rings are a generous portion so we just got 1 order of each for the table to share.   \"Just Fries\" ($8) - They are hand-cut and come with a side each of curry ketchup and chipotle ketchup. I really feel for the price you get a lot of fries and even if sharing, you will still have plenty. The problem is the fries came out ice cold. I picked one up to taste and spit it back out. Nobody at our table wanted to eat the fries.   \"Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings\" ($9) - Parmesan cheese on the rings with  chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip on the side. Again, the portion and price are very fair, but the rings were straight up ice cold and the ranch is ranch, nothing cheddar about it.   \"American Burger\" ($13) - The burger had american cheese, onions, tomatoes, pickles and butter lettuce. When our food arrived to the table, 40 minutes after placing the order, I'm pretty sure my mouth started to drool as the burger was put down in front of me. It looked very good. I will say they after cutting the burger in half, I noticed that it was cooked just as I requested which is actually hard to come by here in Vegas. Too bad the actual burger had zero flavor. The burgers are grilled over apple and cider wood is what they brag about here yet the burger seriously had no flavor and like the other food it wasn't even warm. There was way too much bun going on with this burger and every time I took a bite the bread fell apart as the rest of the burger. It was just not good at all. There wasn't anything I ate during this experience that was enjoyable.   \"Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg\" ($13) - Too much dog, not enough bun. Did taste decent, but they need a bigger bun for it. Better than the burger! Hmmm.  I let our server know that the food was cold and the fries and rings were so ice cold that  t hey must have been sitting for a while. Our server responded with \"Sorry, I was busy doing stuff and then I had to go to the bathroom\" to which I replied \"did you at least wash your hands after touching your junk and brought our food\" and he just said \"I'll take the fries off\" and then he was gone. The whole meal should have been free since it was mostly still on the table because we didn't want to eat it. I said very clearly and loudly that I had a total rewards card to get the discount on our bill and he just shrugged it off and charged the card with the regular prices anyway. If you have a total rewards card then you save so much off each menu item. So you can see where this can actually add up every time a menu item is added to the tab. I said something to him and he said that he would correct it, but it would take a long time and the card would have to be charged twice to fix it. We just said to forget it and I told him it would come from his tip. My friend ordered a burger and paid extra to have an egg added and was specific about it having a runny yolk. Our server said that wouldn't be a problem, but when our food came the egg on her burger was cooked way too long meaning no runny yolk. Such a major disappointment Gordon Ramsay BurGR turned out to be."}
{"text":"Ah, that feeling of disappointment.   All that elaborate fire display at the front entrance ... only if I can use that to heat up my cold burger ...   For some reason, it took me more than half a hour JUST to locate this restaurant because I entered through the wrong entrance (south entrance of Miracle Mile Shops). The restaurant is located at the NORTH entrance (toward to Paris Las Vegas  direction) of Miracle Mile Shops. Make an immediate right turn (you should see Sephora on your right side), walk into Planet Hollywood (you'll see Starbucks on your left side), and the restaurant should be located on your right side.   It was 5 PM on Friday and there was already a long line. Fortunately, we only had to wait for 30 minutes. Our waitress was very friendly and immediately took our orders.    Farm Burger (duck breast bacon + English sharp cheddar + fried egg -  $15 / $14 Total Rewards discount) - Cold and not-so-juicy patty ... sigh. Overall, it wasn't as flavorful as I thought. The only good part? Probably the sesame buns.     Truffle Parmesan Fries (hand cut fries + truffle parmesan + truffle salt + truffle aïoli -  $11 / $10 Total Rewards discount) - Fries were more like potato wedges. What was the one common theme between fries and burger? You guess it, both were COLD (tasted like they had been sitting out for a long time). Fries tasted pretty average. However, garlic aioli dipping sauce tasted very delicious.   Overpriced burger for average quality and doesn't worth 30 minutes ~ 60 minutes of wait. I will only come back here again ONLY IF there's no waiting line."}
{"text":"Best burger place ive been to in vegas. Loved my fish sandwich as pictured in my review & my friends loved their food as well. The onion rings were also divine especially paired with the sauces given to us loved every second in this place. Unfortunately Gordon wasn't in town when we visited :( but glad we were in his restaurant! Such a privilege :)"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch (1pm Friday) and a dining table required a 10 minute wait, but we sat down immediately at the bar.  We ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries, Hell's Kitchen Burger, and the Farm Burger. The fries are an absolute MUST ORDER! They're crispy, soft, and tangy all in one bite. Between the two burgers, we would recommend Hell's Kitchen! The jalapeños gave the burger a nice spiciness which was balanced well with the creamy avocado. A lot of people on Yelp recommended the Farm Burger but we found it to be underwhelming.  The atmosphere and service was great (especially our server Marco)! For Las Vegas, it was reasonably priced with good portions. We would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for a burger or interested in trying a Gordan Ramsay restaurant."}
{"text":"NEVER a bad BurGR! Probably my 2nd most favorite burger in this city thus far! The best part, I always have an AWESOME BurGR when I ask for the off the menu item! The Farm BurGR seems to be a popular one, but honestly anything with their Duck Bacon is just AMAZING!! Their truffle fries and onion rings PLUS the aioli's are just SO yummy! Now,I know I LOVE sweet potato fries as much as the next person, and I don't want to \"ding\" this place, but I don't like theirs. And it is TOTALLY a matter of personal taste. I just don't like mine sweet. I like them salty/savory. However, they are cooked well! The BEST thing on their menu?? The jalapeno poppers!! There are 6 in the serving and 1 didn't get the seeds removed, but they never tell you which one is the hotter one! They come in individual shot glasses in their own sauce. So DAMN yummy! Staff is always on point, quick, friendly, attentive and super nice.   But, be prepared to wait! Seriously! But you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chef Gordon Ramsay,   This is what I call perfection. Thank you.  We loved it, best burger we ever ate."}
{"text":"This will be one of the best burgers of your life.   TIP: bypass the line and walk up to the hostess podium, give them your number, go hang out in the casino and they'll text you when your tables ready.   OR If it's just you or 1 more person, sit at the bar! If you're Diamond, show them your card and you'll be seated immediately.  (Message me to find out how I became Diamond without the $$$$)  This was my 2nd experience here, and from what I can tell, the service, quality, food, and systems, are well up to Ramsay's standards."}
{"text":"After being intoxicated all morning, I was so excited to eat a burger for dinner. Decided to come here with some of my girlfriends. The wait to get the table was a bit long since it was during dinner time. The wait to get our food was even longer.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger which was supposed to be spicy but for some reason it tasted really bland and dry. I was so hungry so to make it taste better i drowned the burger in tabasco, which was a pretty bad idea. My mouth was burning for an hour.  Usually when i'm hungry i think any food is amazing. But for this visit, i was soooo hungry and I still thought the burger was just mediocre.   Also, it's a bit pricey too. $15 ish for a burger with NO FRIES."}
{"text":"This place is a definite must see if you are a Ramsay fan!  The jalapeño poppers were the best I've ever had. The burgers are very tasty and the fries and pretty good. I had the jalapeño Rita. It was good as well."}
{"text":"Waited for exactly an hour for a party of two to sit down, and this was a Thursday night around 9:30pm.  I wanted to see what all the hype was, and unfortunately this place really did not impress me.  The server recommended a good beer pairing initially, but was not attentive throughout the rest of the dining experience.  $19 for my Gordon Ramsay burger was a joke.  It was good but nothing extraordinary.  A Carl's Junior burger easily could have beaten the burger I had.  Earl of Sandwich just a few hundred feet away is a much better value at nearly a third the price."}
{"text":"Place is cool. Staff was friendly. Food is just ok. Nothing special. You would think this place had burgers that are to die for. Its not. I also tried the hotdog. Costcos hotdogs are better. no lie. A bit disappointed since I had such high expectations."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The burgers are some of the best we have had. We have been there twice. Yeah it is a bit pricey but you are getting higher quality gourmet burgers. If you want a standard burger go somewhere else. We had the uber cheese burger... Sooo delish! Hubby had the farm burger last time with duck bacon that he said was phenomenal. The parmesan french fries are worth the splurge and the truffle aioli served with it is divine!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wow, came back and it's a totally different experience!  The Earth Burger that I love each time was dripping with butter/grease whatever that was all over my hands and plate.  After 2 bites, the grease made my stomach sick.  I could not eat the rest of the meal.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"To. Die. For. This place definitely lives up to the hype. The atmosphere is modern and trendy, and the staff is very similar to Lisa Vanderpump's SUR (in the best way possible). I ordered the Earth Burger and it is absolutely incomparable to anything else I've ever eaten. Even the sweet potato fries and truffle fries went above and beyond. This will most definitely be a new Vegas go to of mine!"}
{"text":"I cant give it a 5. The buns were too big and no flavor. I got the farm burger it was good but not amazing. We also had trouble flagging down a server to get some ketchup. The service was a bit nuts as in bad. The truffle fries were very good and iced tea fresh."}
{"text":"I was initially hesitant to come here because fast food burgers let me think that that is what American burgers are (I know, silly me), but on my friend's insistence to treat me there for my birthday, I finally conceded - and loved it.   The chicken wings appetizer rocked my world. The sauce was incredible and not as spicy as I had feared, the meat tender, and the portion size just right. Next, the Brittania burger I ordered was absolutely delicious. I loved the sweet nuance the mango chutney added, and the burger patty was cooked medium rare just as I had asked them to.   Our service the first time around was great, too. Our hostess and our waitress were both very friendly and welcoming, and our waitress did not hesitate to explain the difference between the burgers to us.   Unfortunately, my second time here was not as lovely. I ordered the Chanterelle burger, which came out nicely. The issue is that we had to wait for our food for thirty minutes and it was difficult to flag down our server, even though he was constantly walking around our area. He just didn't seem to notice. In the end, our burgers came out at the same time as our appetizer, which I thought was a little bit of a bummer. The food was great. The service not so much. I hope it was just one of their off days because I've seen them do much better."}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers I've ever ate in my entire life! This is one spot that I come back to each time I'm in Vegas with guests of mine and they're always very pleased. Try the Brit! It's my favorite. The prices are very reasonable for the area."}
{"text":"Cant fault a single thing about this place. We had the Hells Kitchen Burger and a side of parmesan truffle fries and we were in heaven. I loved this place so much I wanted to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I'm not a burger fan but tried this place due to the ratings and it's my birthday, I mean why not. My bf's Hell's Kitchen burger was good and my farm burger not so good. Truffle fries are amazing, the sweet potato fries I could've passed on.   Overall, meh for me."}
{"text":"I had the uber cheese burger it was ok.. i tasted better burgers.. their shakes are soooooo good.. i had their cookies and cream and it was perfect.. their truffle fries was good.. nice ambiance..our server was good and efficient.."}
{"text":"A fellow foodie friend recommended I check out Gordon Ramsey's burGR in the Planet Hollywood hotel and it did not disappoint!   I asked our server what the most popular item on the menu was, and She suggested the Hell's Burger which had avo, peppers, and cheese. My husband doesn't eat beef so he ordered the Earth burger. As I was doing my yelpy research prior to eating at burGR, I was a little leery when I saw pictures of the thick buns. I don't care a whole lot for tons of bread with my burgers or sandwiches, and I really despise thick buns that are dry and dense. However, the bun was perfection! Though it appears thick, it is soft and a moist and grilled to a nice crispy texture on the inside. My burger was done perfectly and the pepper added a nice kick to it. HOWEVER, my husband's Earth burger was even BETTER than my burger! The Earth \"burger\" is a portabello mushroom burger which had fresh dill, radishes, some kind of fried greens (maybe kale?) and other veggies, brought together with an amazing sauce. I took one bite of his earth burger and wished (for once) that I could switch with him! Trust me when I say I would almost never choose a veggie burger over a delicious beef burger, but the Earth burger was THAT good!  I could've gone without the truffle Parmesan fries, and wish that I had ordered just plain fries instead. I don't like Parmesan so that was probably my fault for ordering that, but for those of you who like a strong truffle and Parmesan flavor, you would love this.   Service was a little slow, which was contrary  to other restaurants we visited in Vegas, but the food was worth it. Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay (especially after seeing a different side of him on Jr Chef!), I'm so glad I got to finally try one of his restaurants and it was great!"}
{"text":"I liked how they had the tandoori chicken burger.  But, the service took forever, we waited almost an hour for our food and I felt like our server was kind of food.  Totally not going back to this place."}
{"text":"Man, I came here before but if you come to gordon Ramsay after 11pm, pls beware of cold food and terrible service. I order wings and took a whole 45 minuets to come out. When they  finally came out it was cold and my burger was raw not medium rare.  Gordon Ramsy, if you read these. Pls fix your night Crew. Your night crew is making a JOKE of your restaurant.  We were also told that it was an hour wait and after we said we would wait we got SAT 5 minutes later. Understand that when we asked the restaurant was not busy at all and it seemed as they wanted us to leave instead of sitting us down.   Gordon, pls, pls, fix your night staff!!!!"}
{"text":"The front desk person in our hotel suggested this restaurant as it was in a walking distance. We decided to go when we heard it is RGordon's restaurant. The place is very nice and trendy. The front of the restaurant has actual fire on the logo! The chairs are pretty low (perfect for me as I'm short), but way low for taller person (like my husband). The server  brings you the cocktail menu in a tablet (I kept looking for it when we first sat down). They have a great selection of cocktails and draft beers. We try to not eat too much, so we split: - Beer battered Maui onion rings: the batter is absolutely delicious! Crispy outside but nice and fluffy in the inside. It is thick and tasty- the actual onion, as any onion ring, constitutes about 20% of the onion ring, lol. They serve it with two dipping sauces; cheddar and ranch (my favorite) and a ketchup-chipotle  - Innis & Gunn beer- I know they don't make it, but i was delightfully surprised as I haven't even heard of it. It has whiskey tones. Very nice and rich flavors! Not as thick as a porter.  - Euro Burger (cooked medium) - I think it has been the most delicious burger I've tried! The beef itself is grilled to perfection, it had a subtle smoky taste. The goat cheese is not overpowering as it also has a tiny bit of aioli, roasted tomato and arugula which balances all the flavors- we added some red onions because we love onions and it worked great! The bread was also delicious with the sesame seed on top. Just the whole combination was perfect!!!!  Service was good as well"}
{"text":"Farm burger was fantastic! Hells kitchen burger was just ok. We had their jalapeño poppers where one of them is spicier than the others and they wad fun trying to figure out which. We had a great time!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything was fresh including the bun of the burger. I ordered a Hell's Kitchen burger with also sweet potato fries! It comes with a lot of fries and good to share! When you take a bite of the burger, the all the flavor comes in, it's amazing!   The line was pretty long, 45 minute wait during MDW, but truly worth it! My server nice too! I believe her name is Amanda! I would deff come back! Best burgers in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Food and service were great. Wife got the fish sandwich, and I got the Britannia Burger. They were both delicious."}
{"text":"I went to BurGR twice on the same trip because it was just that good! Gordon Ramsay is my absolute favorite celebrity chef, so this was a place I've been wanting to try for a long time.  Appetizers: we started off with the honey-pig bao buns. These weren't anything special and I don't recommend it. I felt that it was overpowered by the hoisin sauce and definitely not worth $13.  Burgers: I got the Britannia Burger for my first time and the Euro Burger for my second. Both were delicious, but I'd say I prefer the Britannia. The mango chutney had a sweet taste that worked so well with the burger. Honestly, you can't go wrong with either.  Fries: We got the truffle parmesan fries that comes with truffle aioli. The fries were crispy, but soft in the middle -- what more can you ask for? We also got the sweet potato fries that were dusted with powdered sugar. It even comes with a container of powdered sugar in case you want to add more! And the accompanying honey jalapeno mayo is the perfect dipping sauce for it.  Dessert: I didn't care how stuffed I was, I just knew I had to get a shake. We ordered the creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. It was hands down the best shake I've ever had and it was my favorite thing here! So sweet, rich, and ridiculously delicious.  Service is great here and they don't hesitate to help you out, especially if it's your first time. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The wife and I are big fans of Chef Gordon. The burgers and service did not disappoint. We will definitely be back for the onion rings..."}
{"text":"When I hear the name Gordon Ramsay, what comes to mind is the British chef yelling and swearing at the kitchen staff for not cooking the meat perfectly. So burgers with his name on it better be cooked perfectly right?   We went around 1:30 and there was a short line. We started with the creme brûlée and Oreo shake, which is as someone mentioned before, more of a dessert than a shake. Very decadent and probably has more calories than the actual burger.   I had the Britannia burger and my brother had the Hell's Kitchen burger with truffle fries on the side. Both burgers were cooked perfectly and tasted good. I can't say it tasted amazing because I've eaten plenty of great gourmet burgers so it's harder to be impressed. Still if you are craving a good creative burger, try this place out."}
{"text":"I have now been here twice, both times being consistent. It's better to come for lunch or odd hours because this place can have quite a line outside sometimes.   The burgers come out pretty quick, done exactly the way you order them and are thick and super juicy. They have an impressive amount of beer on draft and always ice cold. There's also a good amount of tvs with sports on, if that's your thing. Make sure to save room for one of the pudding shakes. I've never had anything like it and the pudding the milkshake is topped with is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Chef Gordon Ramsay may be becoming more of a household name as of the last few years, but I felt this place had the substance to back up its style.  This restaurant primarily focuses on my favorite food: burgers. Hopefully with a name like \"Gordon Ramsay's BurGR\" one would not be mislead or confused. And for obvious observation number 2 in this review: yes, the GR in \"BurGR\" stands for Gordon Ramsay. This joint is located inside the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino. You'll see a line of people waiting to be seated but temporarily ignore that and talk to the employees situated at the check in podium. Depending upon things, you may or may not have to wait in that line. We checked in w/ a party of three and were told it was about an hour wait. Well, we were in Vegas in a hotel/casino so there was plenty to do while we waited.   After about an hour we were notified our table was ready and were lead inside and promptly seated. The first thing that caught my attention at the table were their nifty looking menus. When it came time to order I knew I had to try one of their shakes I had heard so much about. I decided upon the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Shake #4 which was an Oreo shake w/ creme brûlée pudding and topped w/ an Oreo cookie. Currently, this was and still is the best shake I have ever had. I think a lot had to do w/ the addition of that creme brûlée pudding, but omg that was delicious! I wanted to order another! However, they are pricey for a shake; not only was it the best, it was also the most expensive shake I have ever had.  The burger came and it was juicy and satisfying. None of the ingredients were too overpowering and it was not too hot or spicy given the name \"Hell's Kitchen\" (and yes, I'm aware that's the name of one of GR's restaurants/reality tv shows). The burger itself was cooked properly but was a tad smaller than what I was hoping for, but that's ok. Oh yes, we also ordered the Truffle Parmesan fries to share because I had also heard wonderful things about them and they did not disappoint either. Great flavor and the fries were more crispy rather than soggy which I liked.  Our server asked if we wanted dessert (which any server will do) to which I was going to decline until he mentioned their Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops. I was so intrigued and wanted to live it up during this particular visit that I went all YOLO and ordered the mofos. They come in a set of two and look effing adorable. It was the same exact concept of those push up pops you might remember having when you were a kid, but these had an air of elegance about them. I can't say I'm a fan of sticky toffee pudding, but I will admit that these were not bad at all. I still preferred that shake though.  I had a blast during my visit here and can't wait for a return visit some day. I am interested in trying another one of their burgers and perhaps a different shake. Maybe I'll just get two next time.... Not because of the name but because of their offerings and my experience, I am a fan of Gordon Ramsay's BurGR."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant two days ago for a late night dinner. We were fortune enough to skip the line as diamond members of total rewards, which at 12 am this was great. But beyond the line, the food here was outstanding. We had an American cheeseburger and one of the pork burgers and a side of sweet potato fries which comes with powder sugar on top...perfect pairing! The atmosphere and service was great. They definetly did a great job with restaurant theme and \"Gordon Ramsey\" level of food. The only but valid complaints we had with this restaurant were that the water we were served tasted sour and when offered the drink menu we tried to order some of their different microbrew beers but they were out. If you are going to have a fancy themed tablet to show drinks, the idea of using technology should be backed up by making sure it's updated so your servers don't have to apologize multiple times to say that they are out. We will definitely be back in the future, but will bring our own drinks."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! We had the Britannia and Hells Kitchen burgers along with the Honey Pig buns...everything was delicious and so tasty! I could eat them everyday! And the best part was the shakes at the end! We had the strawberry and banana shake but we changed the pudding(which I thought was cool) and it was sooooo good! It melts in your mouth and makes you happy! Great and friendly service! We for sure will come back when in Vegas again...a must visit to eat!"}
{"text":"After many IG posts and several words of mouth later, Gordon Ramsey's burgers were everything they were hyped up to be and did not disappoint.   The wait system is above par. Check in at the hostess stand, submit a name and cell number, and await the everlasting text. Spend your time waiting at the gambling tables or in your hotel room! Genius.   I went with recommendations by Tiffany N.  1. Farm House burger.  Juicy beef patty cooked med rare, with sauce, bacon, topped off with a sunny side up egg. No veggies here. Everything works well together. The richness of the meat, cut by the acidity of the sauce, the saltiness of the bacon - all covered in runny yolk. I would eat this everyday.  2. Truffle Parmesan fries. Serves 2-3 people. Nothing spectacular, just the usual fries topped with (you guessed it) parmesan cheese and truffle oil. Comes with 2 dipping sauces.   Wait time can be long, so make you sure you reserve enough time for that. Otherwise, BurGR will see my face again he next time I am in Vegas.   P.s. Gordon Ramsey I am scared of you, but I will continue to eat at your place and gulp down your food."}
{"text":"Ramsay attempts to alter the nature of hamburgers from a completely transparent business perspective. The restaurant is presentable but lacks any trace of authenticity. The condiments of whatever clever burger you order are small and placed in the center of the burger- so if your burger has jalapeños grab some water because you will swallow all of them in one bite about halfway through your burger. Shakes are good, then again it's hard to mess up a shake. Fries are fine. Not worth the money for any burger enthusiast. These burgers deserve a place in a picture but not a place in my stomach."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY BATMAN this place has the best FISH sandwich I have had in my entire life! Yes best fish sandwich that has entered my mouth...Now why would someone order a fish sandwich at a burger place? Well it is simple:  Upon walking into the restaurants I noticed the burgers that were being served and yes they looked awesome, but my one pet-peeve about burgers is when they are stacked skyscraper high...I prefer to hit the \"Easy Button\" when I eat burgers and those burgers looked delicious but difficult to eat. So I audible to the fish sandwich, with french fries, and my wife ordered the truffle fries. (We will get to the fries later)   The fish sandwich is very fresh, light, crispy on the outside, but juicy and tender on the inside, they top it with thin crunchy chips for a unique texture, and the homemade tartar sauce is just blissful.    I would recommend skipping the truffle fries since I couldn't taste the difference in them compared to the normal fries, and the normal fries come with a smoky chipotle ketchup which is mouth watering (not given with the truffle fries).    This is place is definitely worth the 15-20 minutes it takes to get seated, trust me you won't be disappointed. Next time I want to try to their milkshakes, those looked extra yummy as well."}
{"text":"Believe what you've read about the wait. 25 minutes for a group of 3 on a Wednesday night. It was worth it.  The service was very good. Our server paid attention to refills and brought things out at the right times.   I tried the onion rings, which really are as good as people say. They come with two sauces and the parmesan garlic one is great. I also had the Hells Kitchen burger. That was fantastic. I didn't finish it all because I wanted to try the fries (very good) and shared dessert with my table. We had the push up pop things, which are good and special because I've never had them anywhere else, but they were also not something I would order again. Their shakes are good. It was odd to see a layer of pudding on top, but it worked.   I thought that the prices were reasonable for a celebrity chef's restaurant on the strip, about $14 or so for a burger."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place since I've always been intrigued by the fire when passing by. I got here around 3:30-4:00 PM and the wait wasn't too long. It was around 20 minutes. I ordered the farm burger and truffle fries. My friends tried the Hells Kitchen Burger, Euro Burger, and Chanterelle Burger as well as onion rings. Everyone LOVED their burgers. This place is amazing. The burgers were delicious and the fries and onion rings were so good. Another thing I loved about this place is the great customer service. A+! I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"the hella kitchen and Chanterelle burgers were the best ever. the service was really nice. they have la fin du monde, which you should try.  always get the truffle fries and onion rings  Gordon Ramsay's burgr makes me wet  they also take your picture, so pose like Ramsay :)"}
{"text":"The burgers are good but not worth the price. Buns are delicious. Meat isn't season well so the flavor mostly comes from the toppings. The farmhouse burger was okay, but I prefer real bacon :) the euro burger was really tasty, but again because of the goat cheese and aioli, it was tasty.  Shake #5 was good. Summary: not worth wait or price.   Notes: Line is long. That's okay, it's on the strip and it's Gordon Ramsay. But. We got seated and then waited about 30 minutes. No food. And they have at least 15 burgers sitting under the heat lamp. The burgers obviously don't take long to cook. It's the service that takes long. We saw a hot dog sit under a heat lamp for 30 minutes before going out. If this was one of his shows, the person in charge of running the food would have gotten the boot."}
{"text":"Expect a bit of a wait, but it goes fast!  I ordered the Southern yardbird burger while bf ordered a American burger. Truffle Parmesan fries are a must!  The chicken burger was probably the best I've ever had. However, bf wasn't impressed with his (which is surprising since he loves red meat).   Service wasn't very attentive and you can't help but feel very rushed while you eat."}
{"text":"Located in planet Hollywood, this burger joint is my favorite! I've tried almost all of them and you really can't go wrong with any of the choices.  Their truffle fries are to die for. And their chicken wing appetizer is also a good pick!  Everything on the menu is reasonably priced"}
{"text":"I was SO excited to try this place.   It was not worth the 30 minute wait in line nor was it worth the price of the food.  Don't get me wrong, they serve a good burger.  But it's just that: good.  It wasn't great, it didn't blow my mind and I expected so much more.  To start, the hostess told us that the wait in line was about 10-15 minutes.  Wrong.  We timed it, we were seated after ~30 minutes.    It took them about 5 minutes to take our drink orders, which is always disappointing (especially when you're at a celebrity chef's restaurant; they always rant on their shows about good service).  My boyfriend and I shared the Farm Burger and an order of the \"Just Fries\".  The Farm Burger wasn't bad; the patty tasted like it could use a lot more seasoning.  The \"Just Fries\" were tough steak cut fries that weren't worth eating.  The ketchups they provided were just ok. I didn't like that the waiter didn't tell us which was which so putting it in your mouth, you're like \"is this going to be chipotle or curry?\"  Not worth the wait, but not terrible.  Also, it was extremely cold in the restaurant.  I think it was to cool off the cooks and employees, but be warned: bring a sweater or something to cover up with especially if you're in shorts or a dress like most people."}
{"text":"Visit 1/2...truffle fries-over rated IMO, just ok. Jalepeno poppers- came already dipped in sauce. I like to control the amount of sauce on my food, but made for nice presentation. I was bummed to find out only 1 of the poppers were spicy and my husband got it. Won't order those again. Then....then there were the most delicious wings I've ever eaten. Served with blue cheese crumbles and shredded carrots...my mouth is watering just thinking about them. Not too spicy not too sweet...the sauce is SO good (I even ordered an extra side of sauce). My rating would have been a 3 if not for the wings. We actually ended up here a second time on our trip and I ordered inky the wings...which made that trip a 5. The service is decent. My glass was never empty and everything came out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I had the Southern Yardbird chicken sandwich. My husband had the other chicken spicy sandwich. We both loved it. More importantly, we had the truffle Parmesan fries. So very good. The beer selection was great.  Bartenders were awesome (we sat at the bar watched a college football game on a huge tv that they changed the channel just for us). And try the Skinny Screw. It was an amazing cocktail... Tangerine, hint of mint. Wonderful overall experience. :)."}
{"text":"It was okay. Doesn't live up to the hype though. Service was a bit slow even though there were not that many people. The burger was nice and moist, but don't know if it's worth $15! Also, $9 is a bit much for the amount of fries you get."}
{"text":"The wife and I went today for lunch.  Arrived with a very short wait for a table.  Service - The service was good, and really would have been great if our waitress wasn't as long winded.  She was incredibly friendly, but maybe she was trying a bit too hard.  It wasn't a big deal in the end, and she was really energetic and informative, so this is most likely an empty complaint.  Our water was kept full and our needs were a top priority the whole time.  Ambiance - It was decent.  It is on the casino floor, if in a relatively quiet area if that could be said of a casino floor.  The was no detectable tobacco aroma.  The uniforms were fine.  Amazingly it was my wife that noticed the girls skirts are incredibly short.  Our waitress was very tall and after observing this at head level while seated, I really am surprised that I didn't notice this immediately.  The decor was an ingesting choice. The tables are very nice, if small.  There is a TV above practically every table.  It has as almost sports bar like feel . . . actually, I take that back, there is no almost about it.  Drinks - Milady is knocked up, so no booze there.  I was thinking beer with a burger.  They do offer a selection of cocktails on the iPad drink menu.  With 2 people this seems practical, though with more it would be annoying(see my GR Pub & Grill review).  The beer selection is strong, with many options varying between macro lager, imports, American craft options and a cider or two.  $7 Oaked Arrogant Bastard pints?!?  Yeah, I am just fine with that.  Food - Again, with milady's condition, no undercooked meats.  She did brave the eggs of Ceaser salad and was happy for it.  I shockingly elected to go for a burger.  I went with the Blue Burger, which is a simple preparation of burger, Stilton and arugula.  I also ordered a side of Just Fries, which as the name implies are plain fries.  My burger arrived in about 15 minutes.  I ordered medium-rare and received medium to med-well.  It was a flavorful burger, and the pungent blue, peppery arugula and smokey beef were well balanced and complimentary.  They use a blend of short rib, chuck and brisket, which had me expecting an immensely juicy, fatty burger.  Alas, I won't call it dry, but juicy it wasn't.  The bun was amazing though and easily the best part of the burger.  As to the fries, they were crispy and hot.  I don't really know what more you would look for out of basic fries.  They come with both a chipotle and chutney inspired ketchup.  I leaned more to the chutney, the chipotle was boring.    Overall - A decent meal, but lackluster considering $50 for 1 burger, 1 beer, a salad and some fries.  Liked it, but won't be back."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place for anyone that enjoys a flavorful burger and french fries that have the perfect amount of crunch, but still soft on the inside.   Having experienced such a let down at Shake Shack, I honestly came here with NO expectations but left feeling as if I hit the jackpot with this burger joint.   Located inside Planet Hollywood, you cannot miss it right when you walk in. We came on a Saturday around 2:00 PM and waited 15 min to get seated at the bar. Score! The ambience is really chill, and the menu was pretty straightforward.   We ordered the truffle Parmesan Fries, which came with truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aïoli. It was absolutely AMAZING. Gilroy has competition!  We also ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which is an amazing combination of asadero cheese, avocado, 1 roasted jalapeno and oven roasted tomatoes. I seriously had zero complaints or felt that this needed any modifications. The beef was juicy, flavorful and did not disappoint. I felt that everything about that burger made sense and was made with love and much thought.   Gordon Ramsay has definitely earned kudos from me in the burger department."}
{"text":"Excellent service! I never had to ask for a drink refill, my waitress sensed when I was almost done with my and refilled.  My friend and I decided to share the hog burger and the farm burger. The taste of the farm burger was fabulous! The combination of the egg with the duck bacon created a festival of flavors in my mouth! On the opposite side, the hog burger was more subtle in flavor but the apple butter gave it a nice sweet subtle flavor. I enjoyed both and highly recommend them."}
{"text":"This is generally a very good burger/bar food joint on the strip. The food tastes great and the atmosphere is fun, but service is very slow and the prices are fairly high. The jalapeno poppers looked incredible though."}
{"text":"When celebrity Chef's make a living being super critical of other people's food, I expect their restaurants to meet high expectations.   Burgr was very busy, even a line out front. We were seated quickly considering how busy it was, but the food took FOREVER to come out. You could see a lot of food under heat lamps waiting for the rest of the order to be ready.   Another name for this restaurant could have been: Food You Can't Fit In Your Mouth. I had the Pig burger which was probably a foot tall. It was good, but very greasy. Also had the gooey fries, which were ok. All of the gooeyness consolidates at the bottom of a cornucopia of fries.   All in all you are paying a premium for the Ramsey name. I preferred Slater's 50/50 Burger...not sure if there is one in Vegas though."}
{"text":"I'm not one to get caught up in all these celebrity chef restaurants (I mean, its not like Gordon Ramsey is back there on the grill) but the food here is awesome.   I had the farm Burger, but substituted a chicken Patty since I don't eat beef. Staff was very accomodating. (And no comments about why I went to a Burger place in the first place!)  I didn't have to wait since I sat at the bar, but easily a 30+ min wait if u wanted a table.   Hands down, one of the best \"burgers\" I've ever had."}
{"text":"Always great food and great service.  Try the crisp fish sandwich,  truffle fries and the rasberry iced tea."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are delicious -- so good that this is a revisit.  We were there for lunch (around 11:30)   We had the onion rings last time.  They too were delicious!  The curried ketchup and chipolte ketchup weren't for me (came with the fries).  Too odd.  The reason for 3 stars is that Gordon would be appalled at the food time from ordering to table.  It took at least 40 minutes.  (That's the reason for the wait time in line outside.)  The server was a bit out there, and the guy bringing water/sodas was equally dingy.  At one point the waitress brought us a soda refill and within minutes the buser did too.  He quickly scooped up the one the waitress brought because \"we only ordered one,\" but he never asked if we had taken a drink from it!  After the food was brought to the table, we felt rushed.  Like the 45 minutes we waited for our food was our problem.  Gordon would be SCREAMING!"}
{"text":"WOOOOOOW   UMMMMMMM... did I already say WOOOOOW??  We waited about 25-30 minutes to be seated on a Friday afternoon/evening/ My group ordered Jalapeno Poppers, and I ordered Hell's Kitchen Burger for myself.   The Jalapeno Poppers- I can't really say it was good or bad although the sauce was really delicious. Out of the 6 poppers, I got the \"special\" one, which turned out to be EXTREMELY SPICY!!! OH CRAP. I never got to taste a regular one so I don't know what it's supposed to taste like..   Hell's Kitchen Burger-  my mouth was still burning from the special popper, and I don't normally eat spicy food, but I really wanted to try Hell's Kitchen burger, which is supposed to be somewhat spicy. so I asked our attentive and energetic waiter to put less jalapenos in my burger. The burger still tasted amazing even with less jalapenos. I was a little worried if it was going to be bland, but it wasn't! Oh, how I wished I could finish the burger...I only ate half of it and forgot about the other half and left it in my suite for 2 days! I had to throw it away of course.... I wanted to cry. :'(   I must come back here..."}
{"text":"Besides the long wait to get in this place is nothing but uber cool. The jalapeño poppers are crunchy yet sily smooth on the inside, the fries are perfectly cooked with a great truffle aoli. The pork hog burger had bags of flavour and perfectly cooked shreds pork patties sealed the deal as one of the best out there. The service was super friendly and eficient. I liked that you could fill out a quick survey at the end to rate your experience. Food 9/10 service 8.5/10 decor 9/10"}
{"text":"This is the best place ever for an amazing dining experience! Make sure to ask for Alex with the glasses as your server. His knowledge of the menu is beyond compare, making your dining experience customized and one of a kind! Definately am coming back for lunch!"}
{"text":"The Euro Burger was good. The fish and chips was great! The Quinoa salad was huge and delicious! The only negative was the super long wait for food. Not the best but provably top 5 burgers ice had"}
{"text":"VERDICT: A very juicy burger served as dryly as possible that makes you question the very nature of existence in the ambiance of a hospital cafeteria in hell.  This is Gordon Ramsey's burger joint in Planet Hollywood in Vegas.  I don't usually review Strip restaurants, because it is usually overpriced tourist trap fare.  I figure that BurGR would provide, at the very least, a unique burger experience.  I had cousins visiting to watch a hockey game and was given the parameters that they wanted a burger or steak.  It was a perfect opportunity to try BurGR.  First, you are greeted with an artistic wall of fire where you wait to be seated.  Nothing is more welcoming after being in the 115 degree summer heat than a nice hot furnace to stand by.  I guess this is some sort of German existential performance art piece.  You get to experience the horror of Hell's Kitchen.  The pain, the suffering, the agony I suppose only add to the culinary experience.  You must suffer before you know pleasure.  Make sure to be seated in the \"No Exit\" section for a full sensory experience.  The service was excellent.  I would describe the decor as \"newly decorated hospital cafeteria in the seventies\".  Which I think is in vogue?  I don't know.  Of course, there are televisions broadcasting all the latest in sports, because the world caters to sports lovers and sports are one of two things you'll ever see on televisions in restaurants.  The only other thing being, of course, menus.  The burgers did take a while, but that was to be expected.  One of my cousins ordered a plain burger with nothing on it, which leads me to believe that he gets the whole German existential culinary experience better than I do.  I got a burger with fancy cheeses on  it.  We also split two orders of fries.  So, 4 burgers, two fries, and three sodas came to over $90.  I have a hard time describing the burger, because it was both good and bad...like life.  This would be ideal if I was taking a course in philosophy, but I wanted an all over good burger, not one sprinkled with the bitter disappointments of a life spent in agonizing self-contemplation.  The meat portion was perfection.  I truly have not had a burger patty done to such high standards ever before.  The bun, however, was dry.  I don't mean just without condiments, I mean dry like it had built-in desiccant.  Any juiciness of the burger was offset by the moisture destroying sponges on the top and bottom.  My saliva was not enough.  I found I needed to down food with water.  The fries were unexceptional.  The garlic Parmesan fries did little in the way of flavor.  They were basically a regular order of fries with a sprinkle of Parmesan and garlic on the top, definitely not worth the extra money.  The fries came with different condiments, one of which was curry ketchup, a staple in many European countries and a condiment that just can't seem to make it in the United States.  I'm mixed as to whether to recommend this restaurant or not.  I feel it's great if you want an expensive total sensory German existential philosophy adventure making you see through the veil-covered illusion that is life.  Or if you got the money, try it once."}
{"text":"Get this a girl goes into Burgr and doesn't eat beef... No sweat. Southern Yardbird is SO. GOOD. I want another one already. It was hands down the best chicken I have ever had and delicious.   Got the onion rings (yummmm) and an Oreo shake. Carb-ing out feels so good at Burgr."}
{"text":"Best burgers hands down. Eating at one of Ramsey's restaurants is like my life long pursuit as I've been a big fan of his for years. After studying the menus from 3 Ramsey's restaurants in Vegas, we decided on this one simply because it fits our budget .   Went there at night and the wait was 2 hours, so we came back the next day and tried lunch instead, got in right away. We tried their blue burger and farm burger (with duck breast bacon and fried egg) and requested them medium rare and they were absolutely cooked to perfection. The outside was evenly cooked and the inside was pink and just melt in our mouths. Ramsey definitely delivered and we were not disappointed!!  The fries were great too with homemade ketchup and aioli sauce. The #4 shake of Oreo and Creme brûlée was creative and not bad. What was not good was the dessert \"sticky toffee pudding push-up pops\". They tasted just like vanilla ice cream layered with chocolate cake while they were supposed to be salted peanut ice cream. So don't order that.   Overall though I still give it 5 stars because the burgers were truly the best we had ever had. And now I can finally say I've eaten at one of Ramsey's restaurants."}
{"text":"The burgers were good blah blah I got the whatever juicy etc. ok now that we've gotten that out of the way. Pudding milk shake?!? Are you serious right now??? How have I gone my whole life without anyone mentioning the awesomeness that is a pudding mf milkshake?!? Omg!! If you go here and don't get a pudding shake you will be making the biggest mistake of your life.   Tldr; the pudding shakes are good"}
{"text":"If your looking to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and not trying to break the bank.. i recommend BURGR. It's a classic vegas style restaurant with all the flare and top notch service.  You will also love the beer selection..lots of unusual, not the run of the mill choices. I asked for some samples before selecting my pint. And they brought me out 6..when i asked about 3. Sweeet! I like that.    The service was outstanding. From the moment we arrived to the end. With that said, this is Vegas..be prepaired to wait. It's expected. I see the reviews talking about the long waits..this isnt McDonalds..if thats what u want its outside around the corner. Our wait was about 35mins before we were seated and 15mins for the food after we ordered.  We ordered the Fish, the turkey burger, garlic parm fries, and pastrami cheese fries. Everything was amazingly awesome. If you had a burger for lunch like myself, and ended up here for dinner.. the fried fish sandwich was a great choice. I recommend it. The Gf said the turkey burger was the best she ever ate. Super juicy and not dry.   Great job Gordon! You have the right staff in place."}
{"text":"We started out with the wings, omg  delicious! They came with a bit of crumbled blue cheese, even my husband who doesn't care for it loved it! Saw Jalapeño poppers, did not try, next time.  Service is fantastic,  fast on refills and extremely friendly!  Husband got farmer burger with duck breast bacon, cheese and egg, I got the Uber cheese and added bacon and pickles.. we spilt them in half, I ended up loving his more and he loved mine more. Absolutely fantastic!  Oh the fries,  what can I say, more please!!"}
{"text":"I went into this with low expectations & came out very pleased. Why did I have low expectations? Well late last year in December I visited the G.R. Pub & Grill at Caesar's Palace & all of the food our table ordered was stale & cold. (See past review). However I wanted to give this place a chance because I am fan of Gordon's shows & hoped for a better experience.. that's exactly what I got!  I ordered the Earth Burger & truffle fries & my friend ordered sweet potato fries & I think it was the Hell's Kitchen Burger. As a vegetarian it is very nice to have an option for me. Also veggie burger being a normal vegetarian option anywhere I go I wasn't expecting much but this burger was A) HUGE B) EXTREMELY flavor packed. The portobello mushroom is the meat substitute & it's thick! There were all kinds of veggies in there... I think even some kale or some type of dark green & more. The cheese was a little too much for me if I go back I will prob get it sans cheese because the mushroom itself had more then enough flavor. I had to get a take out box because I could not finish the whole thing. The truffle fries were just okay in my opinion.. they're fries with cheese on them & again a little on the stale side. It seems like every time I go to G.R. that seems to be an issue with their potatoes. They weren't as stale as my time at Pub & Grill but if I'm paying $11 ish for french fries I would hope that they were perfect. I really enjoyed the burger I had.... as a vegetarian you don't expect much in flavor but this thing will not disappoint. My friend seemed to enjoy her burger as well since she told me she wanted to go back the second day of our trip. This is also considering we are both not really regular burger eaters.   Atmosphere... I really dig the decor. They've got the Hell's Kitchen fire everywhere & it reminds me of the show. It's very brand oriented with Gordon's name on everything & photos of him everywhere.He is def selling the celebrity chef thing but I like it though. It's casual but still trendy. I mean they even have a professional photographer taking souvenir photos like at Disneyland.   Location wise it's near one of the entrances at Planet Hollywood so it was easy to find since we walked there from a different hotel. The waitresses & waiters have very good attitudes which is not something I say easily so that was a major plus. It's very busy in there with a line out front but they managed to check on us enough. Price was about $30 per person which is not cheap but I feel that we got our moneys worth, we enjoyed the food & the \"celebrity chef\" restaurant experience, & on the strip it could be much worse price wise. Would be cool if they made a vegan option though! I didn't see that on the menu. I see myself coming back."}
{"text":"We were staying at PH and were able to get there right after they opened. So we were seated within a couple of minutes. The server was good. But the rest of the staff seemed a little confused on the teamwork -- they brought our appetizer twice (we were honest and sent the 2nd one away) and one person brought another soda to our table right after our server had already just refilled our drinks. Why is that a complaint? Well, they refill your same glass. So when this other random soda showed up, the straw looked used. Wrong table, we were sure. Kinda gross.  On to the food.. Sure it's a good burger. And the onion rings are really good, made with sweet Maui onions instead of the traditional yellow. But let's face it, you are paying for the brand name here.  Yes I would eat here again if I were with someone who wanted the experience, just as I did. But I wouldn't make it a point myself to go out of my way to come back because I know where to get great burgers at home. The sticky toffee pudding push pops were great though. I do recommend those."}
{"text":"Being a big Gordon Ramsay fan, i've always wanted to try one of his restaurants. I finally had the chance last winter when i visited \"Burgr\" in Las Vegas. I'm not a big burger person because i hate eating messy food. Doesn't it get annoying when you start eating a burger and the filling starts falling out, juices come out of the meat, and the bun gets all soggy? Well this burger serves none of that messiness. The bun was crispy and soft, the patty was perfectly cooked and you can still taste the juiciness of it without getting it everywhere. This \"Hell's Kitchen\" burger has asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado and oven roasted tomato. If you are ever in Vegas, i would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great place for casual dining in Vegas! I love Gordon Ramsay and wondered what a burger with his name on it would be like- it definitely did not disappoint! The Farm burger was fabulous- a delicious beef burger with duck breast bacon and a perfectly cooked fried egg. The others I was with had the Hells kitchen and Uber cheese burgers and both thought they were really good as well.  The truffle and sweet potato fries were awesome and so were the dipping sauces they came with.  I am a fan and will definitely go back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wings were great.  Flavorful, moist and greasy. Burger wasn't that good, and neither were the fries.  I would try to blame it on my hangover, but why were the wings so great, if I was too hung over to taste the food?"}
{"text":"Well. I had been trying to go there for awhile and I finally made it.  The service was great when I went.  The food more than speaks for itself.. Their menu made it really hard to pick one, as they all sounded so good.  I picked the hell's kitchen burger which was great.  Plus their beer selection was awesome, and they will let you sample.  This was the first time I have had the beer list on an iPad.  It did make it easy to find what I was looking for though.  All in all, I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is nothing special. LONG line to get in and our burgers weren't even that good. I got the HELL's KITCHEN burger which was just okay and my wife got the chicken burger that was better. I did not like their fries. It was too thick. $50 for two burgers,1 fries and 2 diet cokes is too expensive. I will not go back here again."}
{"text":"Our server, Ryan, was very down to earth and helpful.  He pointed out that the Chicken Soba Salad does not come with any greens and asked if I wanted to add some...great suggestion!  He was knowledgeable about the food and drink menus and suggested we sample a beer we would not normally have tried.  He was not pushy at all and his food suggestions were fantastic.  Outstanding service in a city where customer service is touch and go at best."}
{"text":"Decently long wait for two people at 10pm. We waited about 45 minutes until we got seated. The waitress was great and informative.   We had the Onion Rings, Creme Brulee Oreo Milkshake, Truffle Burger, and Truffle Parmesan Fries. To start, the Onion Rings were good and the milkshake was really good. I highly recommend the milkshake.   For the burger, the bread was a little dry, but the meat was super juicy. For the condiments, something in it tasted like blue cheese / Gorgonzola (?) and really overpowered any other taste. I was looking for that truffle taste and the good meat taste, but only got that strong blue cheese taste. Maybe we should have tried a different burger. Truffle Parm Fries were solid with plenty of cheese and truffle mayo."}
{"text":"Usually I am a 4 star bore, almost formulamatically handing out four stars no matter how vicious I am in my actually commentary. I've got to give three to this place though partly because of the name associated with it (I simply expected a lot more.  Let's start with what's good about it. It has a cool vibe, although a little chaotic. It occupies a great location in PH. It's nice to see PH has finally figured out what to do with its former poker room/high limit/high roller/ they don't know what the hell to do with it room. And for being in a prime location it was reasonably priced.   Now the bad. The food is mediocre. I had the fish sandwich on the recommendation of my waiter, and my friends had hamburgers. My fish sandwich was beautifully presented, but that was the highlight. The piece of fish itself was very good, but the fried toast bun was way to greasy. My friends hamburgers both cam medium rare, but only one was order that way. I tasted both and found them to be bland and surprisingly dry for being as rare as they were. Most importantly though, there was nothing unique about them. They were just burgers with a lot of flair. My friends both ordered milkshakes which were good, but both were essentially creamy puddings masquerading as a milkshake. Again, good, and somewhat unique, but not $9 a piece good. That is the only thing I thought was really over priced. I had a Johnny Walker Black and it was delicious, but I don't think the restaurant had much to do with that.   As a local I know of several burger places in town that far out strip this place. I don't want to drop names but there is an Asian Fusion burger place in town that blows this place out of the water for comparable prices. And for better flavor at much better prices there's a place owned by a group of guys, five of them I think, that is a much better meal and value.   So for the tourist I say this is an OK place to go.It is owned by a famous chef, it is in a great location, and it is an OK meal. Most places on the strip for this price are merely just OK meals. It is worth eating at and getting your picture taken out by the sign. For locals we all know better places which are much easier to get to."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice & it's a must stop if you are in Vegas. The food is great. I love love love the farm burger with egg. My first visit, we ordered truffle fries and it was too salty for my taste. Order the sweet potato fries... It is delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"It is on the newer side so expect to wait a little bit. My best friend and I sat at the countertop seating overlooking into the kitchen.  It took awhile to be greeted but when he got there he was friendly and suggested a lot of great options. We split the jalapeño poppers and held kitchen burger- both were tasty! He did forget our sweet potato fries but after the burger and a couple of awesome IPAs (innis and gunn!)we wouldn't have eaten them anyway. Simple menu with flavorful burgers!"}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Gordon Ramsey - whether it's on Hell's Kitchen, MasterChef, or just his cooking in general - I was definitely willing to wait 45+ minutes to try his restaurant in Vegas. No matter what time, there is always going to be a wait to eat here. But trust me, it's so worth it! They also call you when your table is ready, so you can go get drinks or gamble before you dine.  Burgers here are around $15. Sure, it is a little pricey for burgers, but it's a gourmet burger! My best friend and I ordered the Euro Burger and the Farm Burger. And you HAVE to order the fries.  - Truffle Parmesan Fries: SO SO SO GOOD. (Do I need to say more?) The truffle aioli dip is to die for! Everyone at the table could not stop eating this. - Sweet Potato Fries: These were also delicious, but nothing too unique. The honey jalapeno mayo was a good dip paired with the sweetness of the fries. - Euro Burger: truffle aioli, goat cheese, and arugula = paired really well together.  - Farm Burger: duck breast bacon, cheddar, and a fried egg. The fried egg was on point!  Not only was the food a (super awesome) party in your mouth, the service here was impeccable. The servers were very friendly and attentive to our needs. And a lot of them are cute girls!  By just watching his cooking shows, you know that Gordon Ramsey has high standards for food. And you can really tell with his restaurant. Having an awesome experience here, I'm for sure going to try all his other restaurants!"}
{"text":"Crazy long line when I arrived at 12:30. I asked the hostess if the bar was first come first served and told me that it wasn't. Once she realized I was going to be dining solo, she allowed me to skip the line and sit at a single seat at the.   Jalapeño margarita was fantastic & I really liked my chanterelle burger. Very well seasoned; no ketchup needed!"}
{"text":"Ate at Burgr tonight with some friends from out of town, burgers where great, tried their Blue Burger, simple delicious.  everything here is ala Carte so it doesnt come with fries, but it is definitely worth it.  Service was professional and courteous.  Price range is about $14 up for a burger, but what you get is really great, I would recommend this to locals or out of towners."}
{"text":"The euro burger was amazing, the arugula was the perfect touch. Didn't enjoy the farm burger as much, too heavy for my taste. The jalapeños poppers were dank. And so were the parm fries.   It takes about 25-30 mins for burger orders to come out. As well as the fries for some reason. Kitchen was a little slow in my opinion."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good dining experience. Nice lively environment (especially seated at the bar overlooking the kitchen), and helpful and knowledgeable waitress. Loved that they had iPads and iPhones for stuff like ordering drinks or filling out surveys, and the menu was a nice souvenir, which the waitress encouraged us to take home. Service and wait times were fine, and the manager even came out and asked how everything was going.  In terms of food, we had a split Gordon Burger (apparently not on the menu) and parmesan truffle fries. The burger was presentable and very tasty. I will admit this wasn't the best burger I've ever had (for one, I couldn't even tell that the patty was supposed to be pork and not beef), but the bacon and avocado were fine fillings and the burger was nowhere near as greasy as in many other places. So this might suit your needs even if the burger is just a tad pricey. The fries were good (nice and fresh potatoes) with a good serving of the truffle sauce, although the parmesan and salt were a bit overwhelming. May avoid this one should I come back in the future, but the rest of the menu still looks awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, and each time we were told \"sorry, the kitchen's backed up\" as an excuse for the slow and confused service. The first time, the fries and hot appetizers came out cold. The burgers are okay but not worth having to endure the frustration of dining here.   If you do end up here, get the cheeseburger and a shake. And good luck."}
{"text":"This place is my all time favorite burger joint, I have yet to find another that will be up to par with this one, but I highly doubt I'd find one just as good!! I usually come here feet Vegas trip, and at all times, they never disappoint.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was so amazing that all I could talk about during dinner was how good my burger was! Truffle fries are also a must when eating here.  I also orders a few cocktails and they were made to absolute perfection.   We also ordered dessert and was surprised at how huge the portion was!   Overall, from the awesome staff to the amazing food, this restaurant is one of my favorites.   I wish they would open one up here in SoCal!"}
{"text":"Absolutely lovvvvvved the Hells Kitchen burGR. The burger had juicy flavors and a nice spicy kick here and there because of the jalapeños spicy enough to make my eyes water a bit (chili head) .. The fries and onion rings were bomb and perfect with their curry ketchup!  Overall I thought this place was the greatest, it definitely lived up to the hype ! Next time I'll have to try those astronomical hot dawgs!    They also live up to the strict perfection on each dish, loved seeing how the guy paid attention to everything it shows character and real customer service!"}
{"text":"The drinks prior to the meal may have enhanced the whole experience, but it still lived up!! The hubby and I came late in the evening, we shared the burger with duck bacon on it, and fries... it rocked my world :) Up there with the best of the burgers I have eaten... The sticky toffee pudding sticks were sooooooo amazing - the ice cream.  It was soooo grainy, I got through it to get to the pudding!! Great waiter also!! Super nice!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Overall what a great burger. Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and that was fire!!! Only problem I have is that I took two kids age 2 and was charged 4 bucks each for their lemonade... Pretty ridiculous but overall great food."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I have ever had. The gooey fries were even better. Service was fantastic. The wait was tough, but we managed. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a great affordable meal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Such disappointment from a long time fan.  Party of 4.  Stood in line approx. 25 minutes on a Thursday @ 330pm.  Was sat in a booth.  Ordered was the Jalapeno poppers, Gooey Fries, Farm Burger & a hot dog.  I'd take a Nathans hotdog out of my microwave before I tried this again.  Nothing special.  Vegas priced. Waitress was a bit slow....not physically either."}
{"text":"The truffle fries and poppers are super yummy. I would totally go back and service was fantastic and they played awesome music."}
{"text":"Loved this place the meat was seasoned to perfection. Portion was perfect. Had some left over fries. I will definitely come back! I'm from Los Angeles and driving 4-5 hours to eat here is worth it!!! Thanks for the great food and service BURGR!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Truffle Parmesan fries as my appetizer along with the beer battered maui onion rings and boy was i appetized !"}
{"text":"*Gordon Ramsay fangirl alert*  I've been itching to try this place for a very long time, and it didn't disappoint!  I was told that the Farm Burger was the best, and after reading the description for myself and seeing that this burger involves duck bacon and a fried egg, I was sold. That was one darn good burger!  We didn't get any fries, and instead opted for the milkshake. NO REGRETS! (and I love me some fries...)  The creme brulee milkshake was heavenly! We also got the Oreo and Banana Shakes... they were both good, but my favorite, hands down, is the Creme Brulee milkshake! Get it, you won't regret it!  So switch out the fries for shakes, if you need to make a choice.  Service was great. Our server was cool, but I don't understand why they just leave their iPad menus on the table after taking an order. It was a little stressful with a toddler at the table, because we were afraid he would order something accidentally.  Aside from that, all was good! I would love to come back!"}
{"text":"The truffle fries are worth visiting this place for. The BurGr on the other hand is overrated. It has to be one of the most expensive yet worst burgers that I have ever had. The bun was cold and hard as a rock. I think I may have chipped a tooth on it. The meat patty was seasoned to perfection but the well done meat I asked for was like chewing a piece of leather. The wait was long and rather fun actually. I played photographer for the many people who wanted to take pics in front of the flaming sign. The restaurant decor and set up was marvelous. I love Gordon Ramsey and respect his craft, however I was not happy about paying 30 dollars for a \"beef jerk\" Burgr. I'm just saying."}
{"text":"I'm completely speechless.  Wow.  Worth every morsel/crumb of a calorie.  I got the American Classic burger with sharp cheddar, cooked medium.  It was heaven on a plate--complete perfection.  Yes, it's worth the wait, the calories, the money.  My group said the onion rings were the best in the history of onion rings!! Lol we had a moment of silence in their honor!! Already counting the minutes until my next fix!!!"}
{"text":"PHEW! Gordan, you made up for yourself. You might be saying to yourself, \"Made up for himself?! But it's Gordon Ramsay.. he can do no wrong in the kitchen!\" Well, you probably haven't tried his Pub & Grill at Caesar's. Anyway even after a horrible experience at one of his other restaurants, I'm very pleased to say that BurGR has made up for it and I can see myself returning in the future -- definitely would have to be a 'treat' day.  So you sit, take a look at the menus that are already placed on the table, and the server comes by with an iPad with the drink selection. They encourage you to play around with it for descriptions on their drinks, but I must say this PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU AT LEAST HAVE HAND SANITIZER. Not that the iPads were covered in filth or anything, but I mean come on let's think about this for a second. iPads that have been passed around all day, everyone swiping away on the iPad screen, and then it comes to you and you mess around with it a little, and roughly about 20 min later comes your burger that you pick up and eat with THOSE SAME HANDS. It's Contagion waiting to happen people!  Anyway that's probably the only negative thing I have to say about my experience here. The prices aren't too bad, about $13-$15 for a burger. Seems like the range of prices for a burger at any other restaurant, like Cheesecake Factory or something. What is a bit on the pricey side is the fries. Sweet potato fries and parmesean truffle fries are about $9-$11 each. But I have to say, SO WORTH IT. I absolutely loved the fries! The truffle fries take a shape like a rectangular wedge but has the texture of a skinny fry (does that make sense lol?). I'm usually not a fan of sweet potato fries but I honestly couldn't get enough of both! They come with a side dipping sauce that honestly tasted like thick creamy butter -- I really hope it wasn't butter, cause then I should be at the gym instead of writing this review. One order of fries can be shared amongst 2-3 people. As the main course, I went with the farm burger like my fellow Yelpers suggested and it was nothing short of absolute deliciousness. Still, the fries stole the night. And of course, we completed the meal with a shake. I chose the #4 shake - creme brulee and oreo. I honestly could've done without it. It was just too rich and sweet for me, and definitely does not make me feel any better after the 1000+ calories consumed already.  The service was just OK. Our server wasn't very attentive throughout the night, but we were all catching up and entertaining a 3-yr old that we didn't pay much attention. Hahaha the waitresses are all these tiny petite girls in some tight uniforms and it doesn't make you feel any better with a shake in your hand...or a burger.. or fries, but whatever I'll eat for the both of us! :)  If you have a Total Rewards card, don't forget to bring it! $1 off all items!"}
{"text":"Meh....  I absolutely love a great hamburger... So While I was visiting Las Vegas I decided to drop in at try Gordon Ramsay's BurGR.  I ordered the truffle burger, and a order of \"gooey\" fries.  The burger was \"average\" at best, and certainly not a \"elevated\" burger (as they claim) by any means.  Yes the cook on the meat was perfect, but the overall flavor was unremarkable even though there was a hint of truffle oil.  Dry bun, poor service, and the noise level left me not wanting to come back.  Also...note that if you do order fries...they are a huge portion and likely meant to be shared by 2 or 3 people.    All in all...not worth it....  Sorry Gordon...just not up to par."}
{"text":"Best burger, attention, milkshake, and fries of my life. Management actually came out and greeted and chatted with us and it was the funny and different and very charming. Will for sure go back."}
{"text":"We took the Hell's Kitchen burger, which was absolutely incredible(!) and the blue cheeseburger which was nice but a bit heavy for lunch. We also had the truffle parmesan fries, and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch he other day - sat at the bar.  No wait.  Bartender wasn't super knowledgable.  I asked about the Gordon burger which is not on the menu.  He didn't know what was on it and didn't sound confident after asking someone else so I chose the Farm Burger.  Comes with cheddar, duck fat bacon, and a fried egg.  I ordered medium and it came out probably a little more closer to well than medium.  Not much more though.  It was a really good burger - great flavor.  Would eat it again right now if it was in front of me.  The one thing I was not a huge fan of was the curry ketchup that they served.  I'll try anything once - and this was my first try.  Not for me I guess.  Next time I would skip that."}
{"text":"Couldn't get enough of this place. I am not a big burger person nor did I even know who Gordon Ramsay was before I came here. It was my sister who is a huge fan of Master Chef who ordered me to go so I agreed. We arrived at the start of the dinner rush around 7:30 pm so naturally we had to wait in line for about 40 minutes. Soon another line began to form for larger groups to our left. We got in and were seated at a table near the kitchen so we got a good look at everything that was going on. The lighting was great, wasn't too hot for being so near the kitchen and the place didn't smell greasy or like a \"burger joint\". I noticed that nearly everyone on the staff had a tidy appearance and were either handsome or pretty with a few celebrity lookalikes. Our attentive server provided us with an iPad for drink selection and which had detailed descriptions of the menu and desert choices. I chose to get a draft of Pacifico because I love cervezas over other types of beer and it isn't easy to find Pacifico on draft in restaurants. We got an order of fries to start and awaited our Hell's Kitchen and Farm burgers.   Our food came out all at the same time which was fine and we dug in. For someone who doesn't care for burgers normally, I absolutely loved the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was delicious! And the serving size was perfect because I normally cannot bring myself to finish a plate of food anywhere these days with the huge amount they give in restaurants but I finished everything including the fries. It was a bit uncomfortable being that full but it was so worth every discomfort. Needless to say we couldn't get desert although next time I would love to try something and go at a better time as well. Overall, a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Overly ambitious cafeteria style food - with a big name to back it.  Wings were raw, had the texture of something frozen, no juiciness, and awful Asian inspired sauce.   Pork belly bun was just as bad. Dry bun came with the driest piece of pork belly I ever had.  My burger, which is apparently grilled over applewood, had no taste of wood, smoke, or juiciness. The bun was stale and dry.  Why would Gordon Ramsay put his name behind such a place? Clearly he hasn't tried the food.  I lay here after a weekend in Vegas, on the verge of a cold from partying all night at Marquee. I could definitely have used my last meal in Vegas to get some sort of vitamins, or just a little bit of emotional uplift from the food. Instead I left Vegas cold, empty, dejected, and miserable.  Damn you Vegas, and damn you Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"The great Masterchef host restaurant did not disappoint me! Burgers here are pretty amazing. For the burgers, I got to try the Hell's Kitchen and Euro burger and we got the jalapeno poppers and truffle fries on the side. Both of the burgers were delicious. I think what made it really special (aside from the good quality cooked perfectly meat) is the bun. The bun with the sesame seeds on top just adds another layer of flavor to the burger.  For the appetizers, the jalapeno poppers is very interesting. It has six poppers and only one of them are spicy. I seriously cannot take the heat of jalapeno so I decided to take the first pick, thinking that I only have 1 in 6 chances. But sadly, I picked the spicy one on my first try and that was kind of the end of my experience with the poppers.  Despite my jalapeno poppers experience, I enjoyed everything here very much. Our server was helpful and friendly. My boyfriend and I told him that I'm celebrating my birthday and he gave me a cake pop at the end with candles and everything. Strangers around us sang happy birthday for me and it was just absolutely delightful! Will definitely keep coming back again when in Vegas! Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First the good.... The decor is awesome, they let you keep the menu and the servers are very good looking. The food was quick to the table and the chipotle ketchup was delicious.  The downside, those good looking servers never cleared the empty dishes for our table. We were switched servers twice. We had the American burger and the Chanterelle burger, onion rings, truffle fries, two sodas and one shake and the bill was over $80. The onion rings had barely any onion in them, the buns were nice but the burgers were bland and not worth the over ten dollar price tag. The fries were soggy although plentiful and the shake with pudding on top was just too hard to eat.  Another celebrity chef concept that is overpriced and doesn't deliver."}
{"text":"Taste: 4 stars- Yummy burgers that are cooked perfectly! We ordered the farmhouse, Hell's Kitchen and euro burger!' They were all juicy and packed with flavor. The Oreo shake was delicious and a must order to complete your meal. The only downside were the fries!! They tasted old and stale. We told the waiter and he said the fries are suppose to taste like that and not crispy like American fries???   Price/portion: 4 stars- good amount of food for the price  Service: 3 stars- waiters were no where to be found. Didn't really refill our waters, maybe just once   Atmosphere: 5 stars- clean and nice environment. Very casual!!"}
{"text":"Food: The Britannia Burger and Farm burgers were excellent. Cooked to perfection. Best burger of my life was the Britannia.  The Parmesan fries were less than desirable and I would actually suggest Gordon check out a restaurant in Quincy, MA called Fat Cat. They have mastered these. The fries were really dry that were served to us and the portion size was massive.  Service: The hostess was great and seated us promptly. I thought the uniforms were a bit skimpy and sexist though, but that is vegas. What I thought was really sexist was that a woman and a man had to come to your table to deliver your food and explain to you what it was. We read the menu, so we knew what we were getting. It seemed a bit insulting. The food took a lot longer than we expected and we noticed our fries sat under a heat lamp for a while whilst one the of staff was busy reading things on his mobile phone.  This place was pretty empty for a Saturday night and our waiter treated us a bit like we were cheap because we wanted water from being dehydrated from flying all day. He wasn't a very engaging or pleasing personality, but was professional.   We will go back here for sure, but we did not have dessert because we were not feeling a welcoming vibe from the staff."}
{"text":"I've been craving a burger since last year and I finally got to get one last night! Saw all the amazing reviews for this place so walked 15 minutes to dine here at 10pm. I was a little intimated by the line and we were quoted 25/30 minutes, but we were seated within 10 minutes so don't be fooled!  I tried: Hell's Kitchen Burger (asadero cheese + roasted jalapeños + avocado + oven roasted tomatoes + jalapeño pesto aïoli) - I got this with portobello mushroom instead of the meat patty and it was OH EM GEE delicious! They use real grilled jalapenos here and not the canned pickled jalapenos. Lots of heat and flavor. 10/10 would recommend this to anyone.  Truffle Parmesan Fries - Super thick cuts.. normally wouldn't like thick cut fries, but these were yummy with the truffle aioli.   Farro-Quinoa and Chicken Salad - I didn't try the chicken on the salad but the salad itself was super fresh. I like how they didn't drench it in dressing. 1 of the 2 guilt-free things to order off the menu :)  Service was great, but food took a bit to come out. Not complaining, though. Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is the place to go when you're in Las Vegas! The meat is perfect and you can tell it's not frozen. The bread is delicious and it's a one of a kind burger  We paid $160 for 5 people. We had 4 burgers ,two fries . Drinks and dessert. Best Burger Ever   The ambiance is very relaxing. Our waiter very attentive towards our table. I was very pleased with the service! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"Service was amazing (Sergio). Everything recommended was delicious. Manager checked on us. All around great experience. Loved the Hog burger, the Gordon burger, fries and chicken wigs. All good!  \"I would let that Hog burger raise my children if I died!\" -Jane"}
{"text":"Easy this was the best burger I had in my life! I had the uber cheese burger and it was so amazing! The sweet potatoes fries were so amazing as well! There were some hiccups with the iPad to order drinks but overall this was an awesome experience. Definitely lives up to its reputation"}
{"text":"Dear Gordon f*cking Ramsay, Esq.  Dude, you need to chill.  You have like 275 shows on TV, most of which consist of you screaming your balls off at some poor sap because \"the soup was dry\".  I only ever watch Master Chef, and that's because you dispense earnest, humanizing advice that gives the impression that somewhere deep inside, you still kind of give a sh*t, which your image desperately needs.  But seriously, Master Chef Junior?  What's next?  Master Chef 'n Da Hood?  Master Chef in Space?  And no, I'm not brainstorming for you.  Anyway, the point is, we get it, you're a \"brand\", but we are so bombarded with your visage that it almost makes it seem like your place as culinary alpha-and-omega is maybe not arbitrary (no one can deny you are an accomplished chef) but seemingly self-appointed.  So, because of this, I went to BurGR (the only one of your Vegas restaurants I can consistently afford) with the firm predisposition to hate it.  And based on the decor alone, at the beginning I totally did.  Your face is all over the damn place, your hostesses looked plucked out of a Hooters calendar, and the flames-and-metal decor is over-the-top and uninviting.  But, I have to say, once I sat my ass down and started stuffing my face, my mind changed quickly.  Been three times already, and it wasn't some kind of fluke.  The garden burger with the duck bacon and fried egg is as good a burger as I've ever had.  Definitely top three.  The fries with the fancy ketchup are absolutely delicious and the service was quick, effective and infallibly polite.  I also have to give you kudos for keeping prices reasonable, at least comparatively speaking for a Vegas strip restaurant.  Fries are not included with the burgers but one order can easily feed two people, which is nice to know in advance.  You have an awesome beer selection and I was pleasantly surprised to see that for $6, I get a tall pilsner glass filled to the top.  The Innis & Gunn is a particularly awesome pairing with any of the burgers.  Anyway, I still find you kind of odious, but food-wise, BurGR is firing on all cylinders, and ultimately that's what's important.  The water was a bit raw, though."}
{"text":"I had the Hells Kitchen Burger. It was good but way too much bun.  The burger would have been a little dry without the roasted tomatoes. The fries were good but the truffle fries were incredible.  The service was awesome with all servers pitching in to help and ask about the meal and what they could help us with. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"No wonder this restaurant has 5,000 reviews and 4 stars. This place is the real deal. The burgers are like nothing I've ever seen before. I had the turkey burger with candied lemon zest and blueberry compote, absolutely delicious. We also had the jalapeño poppers which were so tasty and the sweet potato fries which were sprinkled with powdered sugar, such a genius idea and delicious! Definitely a spot to try when you're in town! They don't take reservations so it's good to go early!"}
{"text":"Came here last week. Was really excited to try Gordon Ramsey's food because I am a fan from his shows. Came here with high expectations because he is an amazing chef and the reviews on yelp 4 stars. Staff was very attentive and professional.   We ordered the jalapeño poppers which were very spicy. From level 1 being mild and 10 being hot. It was about 7-8  = pretty hot! The truffle fries were a little soft didn't like those much considering I've had better truffle fries from Other places. We both ordered a burger medium. Both burgers came back medium rare. It was a little cold as well. Without hesitation we just ate it. After 3 bites my stomach started to turn. I ran to the bathroom.  We decided to just go back to the hotel. My partner started puking and had to go to the restroom. It was our first meal of the day . We both felt sick afterwards that  we couldn't do anything the whole night.  The next morning we still felt very sick.   I came here believing it would be an amazing experience of trying a celebrities restaurant.  Thought it might the best burger even tasted. In comparison it is better than a fast food burger but not as good as in and out burger. Most of the reviews here are misleading. I give them 2 stars because of the service. The food gave us food poisoning.  Considering Gordon Ramsey's reputation , I  had high expectations but didn't expect to get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Went last night and had to say it was excellent. Best hamburger ever.. A must try.. We had THE HELL's KITCHEN BURGER..."}
{"text":"The food was great but I wish there was more spicy variety among the wings. I love the burgers and the service was great as well!"}
{"text":"Really Delish place to eat in Vegas. Long line but if you're a group over 4, you get in much faster as they take your name and respond with a text. I ordered the quinoa salad...fresh, crispy vegetables with a light dressing. The curry catsup with the regular fries was amazing"}
{"text":"Very good experience!  Hell's Kitchen burger and Blue Burger were fabulous. A little small for the price but very high quality.  We waited over 30 minutes and then found out we could sit at the kitchen counter. Order a milk shake - the best ever!"}
{"text":"It's very loud, and uncomfortable. For what I expected to be high end, service was exceptionally slow, an the burgers were not that good. Go for the sides and drinks though. Those were the highlight"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas and we are Gordon Ramsey fans, so we HAD to find out if his menu and food live up to his media reputation. We were definitely not disappointed, and so we came here a second time.  The first time was late on a Sunday night, so there was no line. Nevertheless, the restaurant was still pretty full. I will start with the atmosphere: it has a noisy bustling feel, and the ambiance is what you might expect i.e. like a slightly upscale hamburger joint- high ceilings, long narrow-ish interior, with a lot of metal tables for two, along with booths which cut through the middle, probably to keep it from feeling like one of those large Vegas food troughs. The far back end of the restaurant opens up to the PH casino/shopping area so that you don't ever feel pushed into the back wall. This is good because we were given a table at the very back of the restaurant, pushed up to that end. From this viewpoint, looking back into the restaurant is kind of a dark cavernous feeling in a kind of depressing way, because of the noise and stark feeling.   The service is somewhat slow, probably because the restaurant is always busy. My waitress was in a big hurry due to being busy and spilled my champagne as she approached. She told us they are forced to carry drinks on their trays which isn't a good idea for a tall thin champagne glass. It took a while to get the first one and same for the replacement :-(. They need to add staff! For food, I ordered the Euro Burger and my husband ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger. His was good, but the Euro Burger was SO much better that next visit we both ordered the Euro Burger. Both burgers had incredible seasoning and were cooked perfectly. They are a generous sized portion, and one burger is enough for lunch but not for an entire dinner if you are really hungry. We had already had snacks earlier so we did not get fries, but we would have ordered them or another side if it was to be our \"dinner\". The second time we came, it was earlier, around 7 or 8PM and there was a long-ish line. It was Tuesday night and we waited about a half hour to be seated. We were asked if a high table and chairs in the front area was ok, and we said absolutely- because that seating is, in my opinion, much better than the low metal tables for two- better lighting, not as noisy, and staff all around. We told our waiter we were not in any hurry for our food and asked him what other people thought about the wait. He said there are a lot of people who come there with Britney or JLo tickets and expect to grab a quick burger and be out quickly, but that the restaurant takes time to prepare the burgers and food and that it should not be considered \"fast food\".  Overall I would definitely come here again, but next time I think I would go for a booth or seating in the front like what we had last time. I did not like the tables for two. I am picky about ambiance and it was just too crowded and noisy for me, to the point where I'd rather sit in a comfy booth if I'm going to wait for my food ;-)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch early on a Tuesday - no line and I ate at the bar.  Britannia burger was very good.  When you order a burger, that's all you get.  If you want a side, you can order fries.  I got the parmesan truffle fries.  The burger may have been good, but the fries were excellent.  They came with two kinds of dipping sauce.  Burger, fries and two drafts - $43.00.  About averarage for that part of town.  Friendly staff.  I couldn't finish it all.    Overall, I'd give the place a thumbs up.  BTW I saw quite a few people order the farm burger (it has an egg on it).  Looked good- I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"After a long drive to Vegas, my dad and I were STARVING. We thought, \"What the hell, let's try out one of Gordon Ramsey's places.\" BurGR did NOT disappoint.  We were greeted kindly by 4 hosts and were sat down immediately. It was shocking because it was a Saturday night. Then, I realized that it was almost midnight. Vegas... We sat down and could not believe how low the chairs and tables were! (Pic below) Our waitress greeted us with a smile & took our drink orders. I felt dehydrated, so I ordered a water. My dad on the other hand, had a *few* black & tans and (obviously) enjoyed them. I ordered the Fish & Crisp burger and although it took 30 minutes to arrive and was ridiculously hard to eat, I really enjoyed it. The cod was nicely breaded and tasted really good with the tartar sauce and onion crisps. We shared the Maui onion rings and could not make it through half of them because we were so full. They were delicious though.  I will come back to try one of those gourmet milkshakes on the menu because those sounded absolutely delish!! :-)"}
{"text":"Just had the most expensive burger I've ever eaten.   And it was worth every penny. Got the Euro-burger.  Nothing short of spectacular.     It's crowded loud and friendly.  Beer selection is typical Vegas pedestrian.  Truffle fries are everywhere these days.    And the Burger- amazing.     Hate to say it - worth going to"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Go, please, go. If you like burgers go, if you are not a fan you should still go.  Im not a fan of burgers but when i saw this place at Planet Hollywood i started craving them.  The first item i tried was not a burger though, it was the creme brûlée shake(out of this world). If you have a sweet tooth you'd love it even more. My boyfriend  ordered the second day of our stay in Vegas and he ordered it 3 more times after that.  SERVICE: The day we went to eat (~1:00pm) the line was a little long but fairly fast. Once at the table our server was great; there when we needed him, making suggestions but not seating with us at the table either ( sometimes they want to be so nice they finish being one more at the table). Everyone was willing to help; different people would pass by asking how everything was; the busboy was extremely fast cleaning the tables and no empty plates stayed at the table for more than 2 mins.  FOOD: the creme brûlée shake was delicious, as good as the first one  i tried 2 days before that. My bf ordered the farmers burger and as other reviewers say, a palate pleaser. Bun was nicely buttered and full of sesame seeds; burger was mw( thats how my bf asked for it); all the veggies were fresh; cheese was melted. Ohhh and one more important fact: great portion size. The burgers cost between $14-16, which for some may be a little bit pricier than at some other burger places, but totally worthy. You are getting what you are paying for, trust me.  The burgers come without fries but you can order them for an additional $8-11. We got them both: the sweet potato fries with sugar and a honey sauce, and the parmesan fries with truffle oil. I preferred the parmesan fries ( they are thickly cut) but my boyfriend loved his, the sweet potato ones, these were think, crispy and were served with powdered sugar.  I also tried the southern yardbird burger and though it was a chicken burger it was surprisingly juicy. The bbq mustard sauce made it extra tasty.  Service gets a 5 Food 5 (taste, presentation and originality)  Overall 5.  Going back as soon as i visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"My experience here was pretty good other than our waitress who seemed to be a little off. She was nice and all but really jumpy and then she didn't ever check on us for waters etc. which is a huge thumbs down for me. They also double charged me, but was quickly resolved.  Other than that the food was excellent my burger was cooked perfectly and their onion rings are to die for! I can't remember if I liked their sweet potato fries but their drinks were also really good.  This is definitely a place you want to try while you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"**NOT Vegetarian Friendly**  Only one vegetarian burger on the menu: Earth Burger made of portabella mushrooms. I personally dislike mushroom burgers, so I passed. Also, why is a veggie burger more expensive than a beef burger?!  I had a variety of sides instead: Sweet Potato Fries, Beer Battered Onion Rings, and Truffle Parmesan Fries. Sweet potato comes with a side of powdered sugar, making it a great sweet/savory dish. The onion rings were incredibly light and airy, which is abnormal for something beer battered. Truffle fries were my favorite, highly recommend! One of these sides can serve 2-3 people.   Burgers take 30-40 minutes each to be made, even the vegetarian one, not exactly sure why. Burgers don't come with any sides."}
{"text":"+1 for the service. Located in PH, tried the Hog burger and shake #2. The strawberry shake was delicious, however, the burger was extremely salty."}
{"text":"The way they present their food is great. We absolutely loved the jalapeño poppers served in shot glasses. The Hells Kitchen burger was phenomenal and cooked perfectly.  The atmosphere was really great especially  with the fire.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Burgers by Gordon Ramsay? Sure why not. My wife and I are fans of Hell's Kitchen and since Ramsay now has three restaurants in Las Vegas, paying a visit was a no-brainer. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is located in the Planet Hollywood near their front entrance to the Strip. As we approached we could tell that there would be a decent wait due to the long line out front. However, this was Las Vegas on a Friday night, so that was to be expected. Thankfully the wait wasn't long and we were seated quickly by our hostess. Their menu has Ramsay's spin on American burger joints. We both had basic cheeseburgers which tasted out of this world! The meat was well seasoned and they were made exactly how we ordered them. We also tried his version of jalapeño poppers which were served in individual shot glasses of ranch. They tasted good and for something that was fried, the pepper and it's stuffed contents tasted fresh. The real standout for our meal was the butterscotch shake! Good lord was that a treat! It was their homemade butterscotch ice cream  topped with their freshly made butterscotch pudding. All I can say is wow!"}
{"text":"The beef in this burger is amazing. I had the Farm Burger and let me tell you with each juicy bite my taste buds were exploding. I simply didn't expect that feeling when eating a burger.  A definite must try!  The one thing to note is that the truffle fries and sweet potato fries need some work. They are okay but clearly overhyped.  Check this place out. There's a line but worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I probably had way too unrealistic expectations for this place. Needless to say, the meal was still a bit mind-blowing. We had to deal with a ~30 minute wait to get seated (Saturday lunch around noon), but after everything went swimmingly.   I pigged out a bit and got a Hell's Kitchen Burger, Shake #5 (coffee & chocolate hazelnut), and shared some fries with my friends. The burgers are extremely well thought out (and they damn well should be, coming from a chef who recently said a \"Burger would be number one\" as a dish that everyone should know how to cook on his IAmA on Reddit).The avocado, butter lettuce, and patty all mixed together extremely well. We ordered a collection of fries (parm, yam, loaded), and ALL of them were excellent. Honestly, I think the fries are the thing that BurGR does best. The shake was also really, really good - I loved the mix of coffee & chocolate hazelnut.   Gordon Ramsay, thanks for the awesome meal!"}
{"text":"Yummy! I love their maui onion rings. The farm burger was good too.  I also had their hawt dawg with the peppers on it.  It was really long!  I had to eat mine with a fork so I can taste everything in one bite.  The service can take kind of long, but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Foods really good just dont fill up on beer before like i did, but thanks to Ramsey restaurants I'm now a big fan of Innis and Gunn. both the ale @ burgr and the Stout @ GR Steak."}
{"text":"BURGR is a solid, high-quality burger. While I enjoyed it, the burgers are clearly a tier below the great burger places of Chicago that have spoiled me such as Au Cheval and Kuma's. So, BURGR is good, but not a game-changer."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the Service was absolutely amazing!!! Being in customer service myself, its so hard to stay consistent and every one here was great! Now on to the food, ONION RINGS were delicious! I got the Hell's kitchen burger with the grilled jalapenos, super spicy but so good. Only issue was there was a salt overload on our fries.. But I didnt even mind it! Thank you Katie you were the best!"}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of a friend from my last trip to Las Vegas (Paradise). I had the Farm Burger and it was great but the stars here were the fries we ordered. One was a Parmesan, garlic, and truffle oil creation that is truly amazing and the second were the sweet potato fries with a vanilla dipping sauce with vanilla infused powered sugar and they were equally amazing.   The burgers I experienced were juicy and delicious. Perhaps yours, fellow reviewers, were dry because you ordered it well done? A burger of this quality is cooked to medium at most.  As far as people whining about the wait. We walked up, they put our name on the list and sent a text message when our table was ready. We sat in the lounge next to it and smoked cigars.  I also see complaints of a limited menu. Gordan Ramsy is famous for having simple menus. Why would you think a place called BurGR would have anything more than burgers? Are you dense? Do you go to steakhouses and ask for the vegan menu?"}
{"text":"BurGR was extremely good. The pickles were homemade and I really enjoyed them even though I don't like sweet pickles. The Hell's Kitchen burger was extremely spicy. They should totally put the Gordan burger on the menu. Christiana you are the best.( Hell's Kitchen season 10 winner). The service was great the waiters always brought a second drink and refilled our drinks. I would totally come back if I had the choice to."}
{"text":"I like Gordon Ramsay but not for the right reasons.  I am greatly amused with a Brit complaining about flavors.  Be forewarned that I've been to London and I didn't like it. If you like London, you may not agree with my review.     We started with the onion rings $9.  There is a decent portion for two.   They arrive hot and stay crispy.  However, there is too much breading.  There is 3x-4x more crispy batter than there is onion.   I've had better onion rings at the local pub.   The two dipping sauces are good.  However, since the breading overwhelms the onion, you only taste the sauces.  Chef! Taste It!  We had the Brittania and Hells Kitchen burgers cooked medium $15.   These are good sized burgers.  The texture of the black and white sesame seeds on the buns is distracting.  On the Brittania burger, the cheddar didn't contribute any flavor.  Perhaps there was not enough cheese.  The mango chutney provided a nice subtle sweetness but I was expecting some chunkiness instead of a sauce.  I sampled a corner of the Hells Kitchen burger.  It wasn't spicy at all.   Perhaps I didn't get a piece of the spicy topping.  If this was any ordinary burger place that served higher quality meat so that cooking it medium was even an option, then these burgers would be just ok.   But this is Gordon Ramsay's place and therefore the lack of coherent flavor is unacceptable.   This brings me back to my original opinion about a Brit complaining about flavor...Chef! Do a blind taste test and tell me if the food actually tastes right!   I'm probably being overly generous with the 3 stars."}
{"text":"I can't say it was the best burger I've ever had, but it is close.  The meat was well cooked and juicy but I was hoping for just a little more flavor.  The Just Fries were nothing really special, but the chipotle ketchup was very good (the curry ketchup was just a little too strong).  It is pricy, but you have to expect that, so it didn't bother me... I'll probably be back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My bf and I just got to Planet Hollywood and we were starved from the travelling. We didn't want to venture too far so we settled for BurGR. Best random decision ever! We had the Humus, I had the Fish n Crisp, and he had the Farmer Burger (or somewhere along that line). Everything was soo good! I usually don't like the bun on burgers or sandwiches but It was so good that I stuffed my face! Well, maybe not literally, but it was a close call. My bf didnt even need ketchup on his burger, which was really a first for him. They also had a wide selection of draught but we got to try a few before we made our choice. Our waitress was Heather and she's a darling."}
{"text":"We just got into town and checked into the hotel and was starving.  This was in our hotel at the Planet Hollywood, and who hasnt heard of gordon ramsey.  So, i had to try.  The Wall entrance is definitely a great backdrop for pictures.  It set the mood on what we were about to enjoy  Food is phenomenal.  Different types of gourmet burgers.  I feel the bun is a crucial part of the burger.  It was so soft and buttery that just enhance the flavor.    I definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"The worst place ever!!! People that was sitting next to us was intoxicated and broke a glass and shattered on my daughter's leg. Manager came and seemed sympathetic but didn't do anything about it. Payed for our whole amount and left. The worst service ever. This place sucks!!!"}
{"text":"After a long wait in line, I got a seat at the bar and ordered a Britannia Burger.  I think it was $15 before tax and tip. I liked the slight char on the meat. But the meat  tasted about normal, like what my dad grills on game day. Takeaway: dad is actually a decent cook.  The piece of cheese was too thin. I could hardly taste it. There wasn't quite enough chutney. I really liked the arugula. That definitely worked. I liked the sesame seeds on the bun. But mine wasn't toasted enough. It was a very fresh, clean burger, and I saw the Ramsay quality, but it didn't have amazing flavors. It just needed something more. Also, Planet Hollywood is a pretty foul place.   If it came with fries, I'd give four stars. $15 for a clean but slightly bland burger on a plate gets three stars from me."}
{"text":"Delicious and a must try! Best burger I've ever had! The milkshakes are phenomenal as well as the cake pops. They make EVERYTHING IN HOUSE EXCEPT THE CATSUP!"}
{"text":"Burger was bland and expensive. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger, which is really just a burger with tomatoes and avocado. I really was hoping for something special here but it did not impress at all. Everyone in my group thought the same, just bland. +1 for the onion rings, they were good."}
{"text":"I initially got The Mangalitsa Pork + mangalitsa bacon + bbq pork + vintage white cheddar + pickles + crisp onion + slaw but was unimpressed with the flavor; bland and the smell; fishy  I also ordered the Truffle Fries and was equally unimpressed, the fries seemed like they'd been in the fryer several times because they were stiff, hard and a bit salty.  My friends ordered the Sweet Potato Fries but it seemed they were also refried or left to long but they at least tasted better.  The Jalapeno's had a good taste but no warning about them being boiling hot and they seemed fried within an inch of their lives too.    I traded my Mangalista for my partners Hell's Kitchen Burger* asadero cheese + roasted jalapeños + avocado + oven roasted tomatoes + jalapeño pesto aioli and was able to eat that but again it was off it seemed like I was eating a fajita burger the tomato was soggy as was the burger."}
{"text":"We hit this place up while walking the strip, and I'm glad we did. I had the Farm Burger and was very happy with it. This is a great place to stop in and get a bite."}
{"text":"Truffle fries. Nuff said.  I came here on a Tuesday night by myself (work trip / I have no friends). I waited in line for about 10 minutes, which was super annoying because they make you line up next to the \"Gordon Ramsey Burgr\" sign that's lit with fire, so you just stand and sweat. Finally, I was seated at the counter next to the kitchen.  I sat down and was promptly tended to. I order a summer shandy, the Farm burger, and the truffle fries. I lost track of time because I was just watching the kitchen do what they do best, but I think it took about 25 minutes for my food to come out. Not a big deal since I wasn't in a rush.   The first thing I tried were the TRUFFLE FRIES. These were easily the best Truffle fries I've ever had. The fries were thick, kind of like steak fries, which helped keep all the truffley goodness on the fries. It also came with a side of truffle oil dipping sauce which was out of this world.  The Farm burger was thick and cooked exactly the way I wanted it to. No complaints about the burger. It was juicy and plenty filling.  All in all, this was a solid place to eat. Total for the beer, burger, and fries was about $30 + tip. Go get a Total Rewards card and you get a $1 off each item."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, bartender was really nice. Jalapeño poppers and Hell's burger were good!"}
{"text":"Ordered the portobello burger. It was amazing. Full of flavor. Only thing that could have made it better is if Gordon had a Vegan (egg free) bun.  Our server was friendly, funny and provided great prompt service!   The wait can be a bit long at times but the experience is worth the wait. The restaurant is located immediately off the casino floor of Planet Hollywood and you can also access from Miracle Mile shops.   Cool decor and moderate prices (12 burgers if memory serves right)    Will be back for sure!  Please thumb up/comment if you liked this review and I would count it a privilege if you chose to follow me as I review places I travel and visit. Thank you for taking the time to read! ~mp"}
{"text":"gordon ramsay. when you hear that name, you just want to try it because of all of the things he is involved in and the fact that he's a famous chef. which is what made my boyfriend and i want to try it even more is all of the ratings on yelp. our experience= overrated. sideways thumbs which is leaning more towards down. couldn't decide between 2 or 3 stars so i figured i'll be nice and give them 3.   ordered:  *honey pig bao buns comes with roasted pork belly, cucumber, radish, cilantro, honey hoisin sauce for $13. not bad. just not the best we've had! the meat is a bit chewy so it's hard to bite. which makes it a mess and the portion of bun and meat ratio not even. i'm asian and grew up eating asian things. this didn't really do it for my asian taste bud. i would recommend trying this at an asian restaurant instead. *american burger-american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickle and onions for $13. their burgers are grilled over apple and alder wood. such a simple concept and burger. who could go wrong right? well, let's just say they didn't go wrong. i'm just not won over. it did not win me over. not mouthwatering. if you read my reviews you know i love me some burgers. in n out is better than this!  *truffle fries $11- i have had better truffle fries at a mom and pops type of place in LA. better than the burger.   if this is considered a great burger joint then I'm lost for words. My boyfriend and I were seriously so disappointed. saw a bunch of hostess standing around outside. customer service was just okay. nothing special or over the top. we totally would not come back. overly priced!  tips: *they sell merchandise such as t shirts As souvenirs. *cool little fold out menu. *lots of hostess standing around.  *you do get to order off an ipad for your beverages.  *cool and modern decor. *there are TV's around. *cash and credit card accepted. *they serve alcohol. *located in planet hollywood."}
{"text":"These burgers are excellently crafted, beyond delicious, and you will leave 100% satisfied...and craving another one...but you're too full so you have to come back later for another one. (Which I did!)  I had the farm burger; a delicious beef burger topped with duck bacon, egg, and cheddar. It was beyond amazing. The burger was juicy, the bacon was crisp, and the egg was perfectly fried. Usually I have to send my burgers back if I ask for egg on them because the egg is over cooked, but not this time! I had the perfect amount of yolk for dipping. I also got the Parmesan truffle fries, the portion was huge and they were perfection. And to end my meal, I had heaven in a glass. The chocolate milkshake is divine. Chocolate shake topped with caramel pudding and a toffee cookie. Super creamy shake, tastes like a chocolate explosion in your mouth. I had to eat the pudding and cookie first then drink the shake-don't judge me. This place will not disappoint! Even the decor is awesome."}
{"text":"For a man that's so popular on television, Gordon got it wrong. The asian dishes on the menu can't compete with China town. The burgers were ehh. I am reviewing this place based on worth and price. It's not worth eating here and spending so much money for the 'experience'. Go down to the linq and find you Fuku burger. Just sayin."}
{"text":"I know I'm in the minority, but I did not enjoy my meal at BurGR.  We got the jalapeno poppers to start, which were the best pat of the meal.  They were well-fried and the sauce that came with them was excellent.  There's supposed to be one jalapeno that still has seeds and so is spicier than the others, but we have no idea who ate it as nobody got one that was overtly spicy.  But an excellent dish.  The burgers, unfortunately, were not something I enjoyed at all.  I ordered the Farm Burger because I love having an over easy egg in my burger.  When it arrived, the egg yolk had already been broken and had oozed all over the plate, slightly soaking through the bottom bun.  The patty itself was overcooked (I asked for medium, received just over medium well), yet lacked any sort of sear or flavor.  The meat was a very neutral flavor.  There was no char or anything to give that patty some taste and some texture.  It was also very under seasoned.  So altogether, it was a disappointing burger.  My dining companions also had overcooked patties and also commented on the lack of flavor.  The onion rings were good, but the potato fries were not very well fried and, again, under seasoned.  There are also very large images of Gordon Ramsay on the wall making some crazy face with flames around him.  It's a huge in-your-face tie to Hell's Kitchen.  It was very obvious that he's catering to people coming for the Gordon Ramsay name from seeing him on TV.  It cheapens the place and makes it feel pretty touristy.  That same image of him with the flames is on the menu as well.  The cost came to just over $30 each and was not worth it at all.  If you want to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Vegas, go to GR Steak at Paris."}
{"text":"We waited almost an hour to get in on a Thursday evening, but man was it worth it. The food was to-die-for. I got the Uber Cheese Burger and my husband got the Hells Kitchen Burger and we shared truffle fries. The drinks were STRONG. Restaurant is beautiful, awesome fire feature. It was pretty loud inside so if your looking for something more intimate, this is not the place. Overall, great place. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The line was very long but it was worth the wait. The service was good too. Our waiter was helpful and fast.  Love the restaurant's entrance with fire inside the glass. We had to take a picture in front of it.  The food was great, my favorite were the Truffle Parmesan Fries and I highly recommend them. We first started with the Jalapeño Popper Shots. I love spicy food but I don't know if it was cause I was drinking on a empty stomach or my Acid Reflux; but they were very spicy and gave me heartburn. I did enjoy the ranch sauce that you dip the poppers in, it was very yummy, refreshing, and helped with the heat of the popper. Next we got ours Burgers and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The fries were so delicious. I love Parmesan cheeses and these fries were top with lots of it. I order the American Burger. It was very good but I wanted well done. Still good and juicy.  Overall I would highly recommend trying Gordon Ramsay BurGR and I will be coming back when I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (well done).  I've ordered a well done burger at other establishments before but, this one was a more on the burnt and dry side. Something I didn't expect from a GR restaurant. The burger comes without lettuce, tomatoes or pickles.   We also ordered the American Burger (well done).  The burger was a good size. I would guess almost 4 inches tall. It was a bit burnt as well but, not too dry.   Truffle fries was good.  The strawberry shake and Oreo Shake was the highlight of the dinner.   Overall, everything was a bit too salty for our taste. Next time, we're going to request low sodium and have our burgers cooked medium well. I deducted one star for the burger and another star because the waitress could have checked on our table more frequently. I do understand the restaurant was packed."}
{"text":"OMG! THE HOG won me over!!! It's a pork burger, but tasted like Kobe Beef burger. I love how it was new on the menu too, so I felt extra special to have had the opportunity to try it. We ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries which were great too - They were thick steak cut fries and it came with garlic aiolie dipping sauce. YUM!   Prices were a bit high, but it's a GOURMET burger, and that's what you're gonna get in Vegas anyway - In my opinion, it's totally worth it!   Staff is great, and wait wasn't so bad just as long as you get there early. They were nice to us as our entire party didn't show up yet, but they were willing to hold the table for us for 30 mins.   Can't wait to go back there to try more things!"}
{"text":"It's pretty much what you would expect. Line-ups, very friendly server, pretty people and tasty burgers.  To be more specific, we ordered the Ramsay Burger, The Hog burger? and the much anticipated Truffle Fries.  The wait for the food was longer than I would expect and it all came at once instead of the fries first.  Our burgers were very filling, with generous amounts of meat.  However, it was not amazing and at such an establishment, you kind of expect amazing (no offence to the restaurant).  The beef patty that I had was moist and \"beefy\" in taste and my wife's pork patty was almost pulled pork tasting.  The best was the fries which came with truffle Parmesan and their special ketchup and mayo.  The fresh cut fries were very crispy and the sauces kept it interesting.  In the end, not bad, but I wouldn't be able to afford this everyday.  The food was on the oily side and I have to admit I needed to use the restroom pretty soon afterwards.  With so much comparative competition on the strip, other more moderately priced burger joints (ie Shake Shack, In-and-Out) are more plausible."}
{"text":"I almost gave up on this place...Line up was long and come on, it's only burger.   I wasn't going to wait, but the line moved quickly and I was lucky enough to order my burger by a beautiful fire place. My burger was juicy and the portions were good.  Now I know why this place is popular. Gordon Ramsay Burger was great!  I enjoyed very much. if you are in Vegas, I recommend you to try here"}
{"text":"Being vegan, me and my wife ordered Earth Burger (veggie) and to be honest this was the worst burger we have ever eaten. $15 for such a crap. On top of that they won't even serve you any sides. Serving size is also small. I am not going to this place again ever !  If you want some really awesome burger, try Veggie Burger in Grand Luxe Cafe in Venetian or Palazzo. You will love it."}
{"text":"Patties to dry, to much carbon monoxide in the patty. Not fresh. In n out is way better and juicier."}
{"text":"Came here for my bday dinner and was excited to try this place. Got here around 9:30 pm and had to wait 45 min for our table. Finally sat down and ordered onion rings, jalapeño poppers, the truffle Parmesan fries, and my husband got the farm burger, I got the Hell's Kitchen burger, and my son had the standard dawg. Food was decent nothing special or memorable but then came dessert... Got a free sticky toffee pudding pop for my birthday and was really good. We also got a shake #4 to go and it was amazing! Probably wouldn't go back for food but definitely will be back for a shake."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had! Generous size!   Euro burger: goat cheese, arugula, tomatoe and Truffle Aiolie !!  Chanterelle Burger: chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, figgy-onion jam  Service was average.  Waitress friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Delicious. That's all I gotta say!!! The staff were nice and friendly as should be expected and the food is terrific!!!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best experience I could hope for! We were waited on by Nadine. She was delightful and knowledgeable of the menu! Everything was above and beyond expectation for my mother in laws birthday and I couldn't be more pleased! Definitely stop in and see Nadine and order the Hell's Kitchen burger it was to die for!!! Thank you for the best experience yet!"}
{"text":"Get there early to avoid wait.  Line pretty much started forming around 10:30 (they open at 11am) on a Saturday.  A little mix with up our fry order, they gave us two truffle instead of one truffle and one sweet potato, but that was quickly fixed.   Split a farm burger and chanterelle burger with my friend and both were delicious. Both burgers were cooked to medium but still nice and juicy.  Patty to topping to bun ratio was on point.   The duck bacon on the farm burger didn't really taste too much like duck but it really did taste like bacon. But if I could order a bowl of these I would.  Farm burger was definitely the richer burger, but the chanterelle was also really satisfying. The fig-onion jam on the chanterelle burger was kind of lost underneath the chanterelles but the veg topping was a welcome change after the egg and duck bacon on the farm burger.  Got a table near the open kitchen so we got see Christina from Hell's Kitchen expediting for a bit.   Good job on this one Gordon Ramsey!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Las Vegas the Gordon Ramsay Burgr restaurant was on our list to visit and I will be forever grateful to our wonderful server Ginger for suggesting and offering me the opportunity to experience my, and possibly \"THE\", best burger experience I ever tasted and possibly ever will.  First let me say I love Burgers and I am always in search of the Best of the Best Burger.  Living in Fort Worth  there are always Burger wars in search of what and where is the Best Burger in the DFW area, which I have tried most of them and agree with some and not so much with others.  But, I have to say, I have now experienced the absolute Best Burger of all time and in my opinion it will be hard to ever replace this Burger from my Top Number 1 position. Perhaps it could be the Best Burger in the USA ok, maybe in the World. Yes, I am Serious.   I am speaking of the incredibly amazing, not on the Menu, Special Gordon Ramsay Burger at Gordon Ramsay Burgr Restaurant inside Planet Hollywood.  This amazing burger is made with Mangalitsa Pork which at the time of consuming I did not know what a privilege I was experiencing but Wow all I knew was the meat on this burger was an incredible mouth watering moment I will never forget.  I know, I know it was a Burger, but you have to understand It absolutely was and is THE Best Burger!  It all happened by a mere suggestion by an excellent astute server  by the name of Ginger.  I had actually read so many reviews of the bad service that I almost missed out on the Best Burger experience in my Life and now all I can think of, Is when can I get back to Vegas and try it again.  This Burger is made with Mangalitsa Pork grilled to it's perfection with Duck Breast Bacon, fresh avocado, English Sharp Cheddar and I think Butter Lettuce and maybe a tomato chutney jam? don't hold me to that.  I could not decide which Burger on the menu to choose, from my favorite TV Chef personality, Gordon Ramsay, so let me say yes, I am a Hell's Kitchen, Masterchef lover so of course I thought it would be the Hell's Kitchen Burger which according to reviews is wonderful, but I really could not decide and thankfully,  Ginger,  suggested the \"Gordon Ramsay Burger\" (an off Menu Item).  So I highly recommend and suggest if you get the chance, try it and you will be pleasantly amazed.  It was ecstasy and a Burger Lovers must try. To sum it up,  Perfection Simply Perfection!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb dot com! Food is stellar and service is spot on. Love the simple menu and the shakes are to die for. I wish we had one locally!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger ive had in a very long time. The Brittannia Burger... NAMM NAMM NAMMM. I wish i had some more mango sauce whatever that was. I did not like the truffle fries but thats not going to stop me from giving away 5 stars.  My dude got an American Burger... ehhh coulda been a lil more juicy. Our waiter was awsome not to mention hot. The chick walking around refilling drinks was just a mess. Bringing 2 rootbeers back when theres 2 pepsi. Refilling my dudes Siera Mist with water LoL... not to mention she looked hungover.   I loved the outfits of All the workers in there. Not all the same. Cute. In Style.  I dont think I will be back to Vegas but if I do... I will be back"}
{"text":"Disappointing. We both ordered the Farm Burger due to it's reviews on Yelp. Both found it dry and bland. Had Gordon Ramsay been critiquing it on a show, he most certainly would have sent it back. Seriously, you'd think a master chef would know how to use some seasoning. I had a better burger at Carl's Jr on Highway 15 on the way to Vegas  The Parmesan Truffle Fries were very good, definitely the highlight of the meal. Served with delicious homemade ketchup and another type of aioli.   The milkshake was pretty good. Actually more like a cup of half milkshake half pudding. But still pretty good (and maybe even $9 good)  Overall we were disappointed with this place, not worth the money and not worth the line.   Burger: ** Milkshake: *** Truffle fries: ****"}
{"text":"We watch Kitchen Nightmares so we were curious and anxious to eat here since Chef Ramsey has such uncompromising standards. At least on TV.  I must say that the experience was inconsistent at best and disappointing at worst.    We went early New Year's Eve and waited only 25 minutes or so for a table, which I guess is pretty good.   I got the blue cheese burger, and it was not good at all. The beef was overcooked to the point of being dry and difficult to swallow. I had asked for pink in the middle to keep it juicy, but there was not a drop of juice in that burger and there was no pink. Come on, it's a burger, they should know how to cook it right. If Chef Ramsey had tasted my burger he would have made a face and pushed it away, claiming that it was so dry as to be inedible. And he would be right.  On the other hand, the wife's Farm Burger was excellent and cooked correctly. The flavors came together and the wife loved it.   The onion rings were the best I have ever had, light and not greasy.  Like almost every restaurant on the strip, this place is over-priced with some mediocre food. To his credit, the burgers are not as over-priced as at some restaurants on the strip (just walk through various hotels and look at the outrageous prices). Still, with two burgers, onion rings, and a couple of beers plus tax and tip the bill was over $70, and only one of the burgers was any good.   The wife would return, but she would have to go alone because I would not return."}
{"text":"Perhaps my expectations were too high, as I'm a Masterchef follower and watch Gordon Ramsay Youtube videos on the regular. But pretty sure Chef Ramsay would have asked, \"WHAT ARE YOU MISSING?\" and the answer would be \"salt.\"   I got the chanterelle burger (with \"rocket\" lol) which was good, but definitely not savory enough, and I literally don't recall actually tasting the flavor of the mushrooms :|  Wedge cut truffle fries were good (no surprise here) and my partner's farm burger was tasty.  Note that we waited about 20 minutes at 6:30pm for our party of two - less than we expected with a ~40 foot line, but we sat at the bar."}
{"text":"WOW!! SO UNBELIEVABLE! I've ordered a handful of burgers my 30 years of living and this has to be the BEST burger ever! I ordered a Farm Burger which had a fried egg! The bun was so soft and the sesame seeds made it look amazing!! I ordered it Medium and it was perfect! My fiance ordered the American burger. He loved it. I enjoyed my burger so much that I didn't realize I finished before my fiance did!! YUM!!  The onion rings were good, I would recommend them a little more crispy, and the truffle fries were awesome as well.  Karlenda was our waitress and she was so sweet and patient with us. I would definately come back here during my next visit to Vegas. The food, the service, and the atmosphere definitley made our eating experience quite enjoyable!!   I wouldn't recommend this place if you are super duper hungry. The wait could be almost a 2 hour wait, but I believe it's so worth it!! Long wait means GREAT FOOD!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here on 4/10/2015. We didn't mind standing in the 45 minute line because we thought it'd definitely be worth it. We were not wrong! Not only was the service fast, friendly, and amazing, but the food was above and beyond our expectations."}
{"text":"Great fries and burgers! Great flavor combinations,  didn't expect things to taste as good as they did!"}
{"text":"Being a local here , and dining at lease once a month at this restaurant, happy to say that burgers are the best you'll find anywhere in Vegas , the Euro is awesome . The only thing cheesy jalapeños , very hot please be aware lol"}
{"text":"Super delish!  I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and I got schooled on what a burger should taste like.  Amazing flavor, nice kick.  Reasonable price.  This review is my gift to you.  Eat here!"}
{"text":"Mmm this was so good! The food gets 4 stars and +1 star for service :) Expect a line up before the doors open! We were browsing around Planet Hollywood's casino area a little before the lines started picking up - didn't realize there would be such a long line up, so heads up! The variety of burgers were great - the waiter was very knowledgable with the menu; he recommended items for our group and also named some of the popular items on the menu. I like how all the burgers that we ordered were not oily at all.  DRINKS: APPLE CIDER BEER   SNACKS: BEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS (4/5) Usually onion rings have a very thin onion inside the batter, but they put two thick onion rings inside the batter - which I liked a lot. We were super full off of this already!  BURGERS: FARM BURGER (4/5) (duck breast bacon + english sharp cheddar + fried egg) My favourite out of all the burgers we shared - soo juicy!  HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER (3.5/5) (asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomatoasadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato) Love the avocado combination. The jalapeno peppers aren't that spicy - which is good.  FISH & CRISP SANDWICH (4/5) (ale battered cod, salt & vinegar crisps, fresh dill tartar sauce) The portion is pretty big for this one - love the fish and tartar sauce combo. Very delicious; I think this can be for two people to share to be honest.. It was huge!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in the entire world. I went in November 2013 with a bunch of friends. We loved it so much that we went a second time within our 3 day stay! Hell's Kitchen burger changed me, and spoiled me from mediocre burgers for life. Also loved the onion rings and fries. The service was amazing. This is a place I will visit every time I visit Vegas, and I highly recommend it. Go try it now!"}
{"text":"Just okay. Service was decent and the sides were good but our burgers were decidedly average among the \"high-end\" burger joints popping up all over Las Vegas. Also the pudding shakes don't quite measure up to a good ice cream shake. The fish sandwich looked excellent, wish we ordered that instead. For a high end burger and a shake you would do better at a few (less crowded) places, especially Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay which is outstanding."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to finally get to eat at one of GR's resturants!  I ordered the Uber cheese burger and my husband ordered the Brittian burger and together we shared an order of the truffle fries.  Our burgers were delish!! The truffle fries were just ok.  The resturant is beautiful and the presentation is beautiful!! A bit pricey for a burger and fries but we expected that and loved every bit of the experience! We even had a lady come around and take our photo (of course to sell to us!) and put it on a collage with GR! Overall great experience, delish burgers, our waitress was rather slow but not to the point of leaving.  For 1 soda, 2 burgers and an order of truffle fries our bill came to $48.65."}
{"text":"The wait was too long. I think any local such as I, will agree that bachi burger is way better and way cheaper as far as fancy burgers go that is. Food isnt bad but just not worth the money and the experience."}
{"text":"Gotta love when you are asked how you want your burger cooked and it actually comes out the way you want it. It was a very loud place. But that was my only thing I didnt like. Besides that, worth the money and wait in line."}
{"text":"Pretty excited about the opening of another burger joint in Vegas. We originally were headed to Holsteins but it was rather late (and we found out that they no longer were serving burgers at the time) so we went across the street to PH to try BurGR! We ordered the chanterelle burger ($16!!! WHAT!), just fries ($8), and a kale caesar salad ($12...and no protein!).  The burger was not as juicy as Holsteins, but still pretty tasty.  The fries were decent -- could be slightly more crispy outside. They came with two interesting twists on ketchup -- one was chipotle-flavored and the other curry-flavored. Not to say we disliked those, but we did wish they also provided normal plain ketchup with the fries.  The salad was WEAK. The name is kind of misleading since there actually wasn't much kale in it -- maybe 20%. The rest was all romaine lettuce, with everything COVERED with parmesan cheese (literally, every leaf was coated on both sides of fine cheese powder so it's not like I could just shake it off). It seemed like there were equal amounts of cheese to lettuce...pretty ridiculous if I say so! (See picture for reference). There was so much cheese and its flavor so powerful that I ended up using minimal dressing. The kale was ok, but the romaine pieces weren't very fresh...the edges were browning and wilting.  The food here isn't the greatest, nor do we plan to come back, but the servers are SO friendly and kind! Some of the best service we've received in Vegas!  Also, if you show your total rewards card, you get $1 off each item!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers but the truffle fries was too salty for me. Service is just okay. So basically nothing special about this place. I would prefer In-N-Out burger over this place."}
{"text":"SHUT THE FRONT DOOR:) just go for the burgers, cocktails an OMG the oreo s.h.a.k.e. Those 3 elements, and the efficient an sooo friendly hosts an chefs ,were for my experience amazing. I did not want to leave. Could have stayed all night. I sat right at the grill pass, right infront of the chefs, an as a past chef myself, it was exciting to see with under all the fast pace an pressure how entertaining the staff were behind the line:) yes the truffle fries were a bit salty, an the onion rings , an i wasn't very impressed with the jalapeno poppers( yes one of them is dam hot:) i did kindly tell the chef:) but nicely of course:) but the experience was amazing, no complaints here, i actually went twice in 1 week. Its a must for the experience an everytime i go to vegas i will go. Some food was on the pass a bit too long for my likely if u know the restaurant biz, but apart from a tad to much salt an yes all servers but mine should have move there CHEEKS :) a bit faster to get the food out, all was good. Brandon was my server , an he flew:) he was fast , full of energy and very accomodating,, he made small talk fast:) he is awesome , quick at his duties, and has time to talk to his guests. he made my experience top of the world, needs a promotion. I do think as a professional myself that all lady servers should have there hair tired up, an some :) could of looked more professional. The manager did check on me , we had a convo, nice. time of visit about 2pm stayed till after 5pm , well after, i even did some upsell for the mother an daughter sitting next to me. Oreo shake is a screaming O which i can't really stay ,,, :) Not all servers wore name tags ?? not good ladies :) the venue is fashionable , music danceable, an up2date,crowd ranges from 2 yrs to over 60 sooo every1:) the front of house staff need to be more professional looking,, Jason was the manager:) only advice to hime is to check name badges an if the lady servers have there hair tied up:) he was on alert too ,, he had the venue under control. if u go vegas an love burgers gooooooooooooooooo, try an see,,, remember, cocktails, OREO shake an any big fat Gordon Ramsey Burgr, if u don't like theres something wrong with u:) an u dont no about  food ,, i go vegas every yr, but this is the first time Gordon's Burgr venue has been available , open ready,, so its now a tradition to go every time, to tell all i know to go, an i cant wait to get back,, cheers gordon:) Maybe u should cook the burgr next time :) xxxxxxxx"}
{"text":"We thought hamburgers were kind of pricey and very average quality. Service was extremely slow (we waited around 45min for our food).  It seems like a more gourmet restaurant, with fabric napkins and fancy ingredients; but the reality is that the burgers are very average. We would have been more satisfied at any fast food place.  Fries were okay but very expensive ($8-$15).  The place was very crowded and loud. The restaurant was very nice."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay has high standards when it comes to food, especially at his restaurants. BurGR is the first Gordon Ramsay restaurant I have dined it, and it did NOT disappoint!  SERVICE: 90/100 A 90-minute wait greeted us when we arrived. Luckily, the hostess at the podium allowed us to reserve a table for 7:30pm and let my party of six go next door to the Miracle Mile Shops and do whatever we wanted; thus, there was no need to wait in the EXTREMELY long line. Our server, Greg, promptly seated us when our time came and gave us an iPad to browse draft beers and specialty cocktails. Greg and everyone at BurGR were very friendly to us, though I must admit that asking for necessities (e.g, water refill) did take a while because everyone was running around, back-and-forth. It was also crowded today (as is with many other eateries on the Strip), so be warned.  VALUE: 95/100 $150 for a party of six...at one of Ramsay's restaurants? It sounds way too good to be true. A chicken and quinoa salad, Gooey Fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, pork belly pockets and FOUR full-sized burgers...for $150. If you're willing to wait upwards of 30 minutes for this, your patience will pay off. Believe it.  FOOD: 95/100 The Gooey Fries were very cheesy and full of flavor, but were on the salty side. Fries with melted cheese, topped with ham, green onions, and an over-easy egg...this dish is RECOMMENDED if you're looking to share. The onion rings were topped with grated Parmesan cheese. VERY crispy and crunchy. You can't go wrong here. Another RECOMMENDED from me. Sweet potato fries - if you've had them before (and I am quite certain the majority of you reading this HAVE), there is literally no noticeable difference. It does have a light crunch to it, which I enjoy. The pork belly pockets - topped with tomato jam and a herb aioli - probably the most disappointing of the appetizers. The aioli was overly spicy for my personal tastes, the pork belly was lacking seasoning, and the size of the dish? Very small and personal; NOT something I'd recommend.  The Hell's Kitchen Burger is something I CAN RECOMMEND to you Yelpers. The patty was perfectly seasoned; the bun was airy and light, like a cloud; the cheese, jalapeño, and aioli complemented one another to create a STUNNING burger I may never have again.  OVERALL SCORE: 92.5/100  ----------  TL;DR: If you're willing to wait to eat burgers at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, your patience will be rewarded. By far the best burgers I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Slow service and subpar food. My burger was ok, nothing special, but all of the sides, house-made ketchup and sauces and the house beer were terrible. Staff was slow in taking orders, they forgot to bring out part of my meal and they were very slow bringing the check, which led to a longer wait to get in.  One staff member was excellent, but her talents are wasted on bussing and running drinks and refills. When she saw my fries didn't come out she literally dropped what she was doing and checked on them even though she was not our actual server. I wish I could remember her name; thin brunette, was working on Monday 3/21/16 at around 7pm."}
{"text":"With Gordon Ramsay Resstaurants, you either love his style or hate it. I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and his style of cooking, I tried their Hell's kitchen burger and I have to say Its simple but delicious. The service was really good and Their cocktails were reasonably priced. The food for 2 with 2 drinks and a fries came to about $45 which is not bad for Vegas. The fries and sides are separate orders."}
{"text":"In the wise words of Gordon Ramsay, \"This was bloody fantastic.\" Also, \"*BLEEP* BLEEP* *BLEEP* %$%#%#!!!!\"  I didn't expect much going in, as every time I walked past BurGR it was always filled with tourists that looked miserable and tired. Tourist trap to the max, but like a moth to a flame, I was attracted to it and knew that after 3 times in Vegas without going in, this was it.   If you're a Total Rewards Member (at a higher tier), all menu items are a dollar off and you can cut everyone in line. Too bad all my points are at MGM.The wait wasn't too terrible and I was plenty entertained by the people behind me talking about Master Chef Junior and the differences between the UK and US Gordon Ramsay shows.   My friend and I weren't in the mood for fries (wahh...next time) so we split a cold chicken soba salad and HOT DIGGITY DAMN. Yes. Drop whatever the hell you're eating and split this. It was so good I didn't even want my burger anymore. I just wanted more salad.   She ordered the Farm Burger (\"orgasm in my mouth\") and I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger medium rare. DELICIOUS. While not the best burger I've ever tasted, it is definitely top 5. Everything went well together and I happily scarfed down $15 while trying not to look like I was vacuuming it into my mouth.  The service was fantastic and our server was personable and friendly (not to mention super young). I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I really liked the service and the food was exquisite.  The burger had a great flavor I got a arugula mango chutney burger and added duck bacon to it. My son didn't eat his food because he's an alien and doesn't eat so I was left to eat his food also. Which was a gigantic hot dog.  It was fabulous. The sweet potato fries were the bomb also the parmesan garlic fries. OMG! The parmesan garlic fries were really something special because they tasted just like the ones in the San Francisco giants stadium they are one of a kind and now I don't have to go all the way to S.F. to get them. The waiter was really nice the manager came over shook our hand very nice. I love this place."}
{"text":"Not sure what the rave is about. My Hell's Kitchen burger (medium rare) was fine but nothing amazing or even memorable. Perhaps my expectations were too high for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. However the jalapeño poppers were great.. the sauce is perfectly creamy and highly addictive! I was secretly hoping I would get the spicy popper but no such luck. The wait was an hour long but the hostess let us put our name down and walk around until our table was ready, which was really appreciated. Although the burger was a bit disappointing, I might just be back for those poppers."}
{"text":"Love the very modern look and feel of the restaurant. The square plates and unique shape of the utensils were very interesting.  We ordered and expensive tea, but it was fresh brewed and really hit the spot.  We decided to start with an appetizer of \"Fury of Chicken Wings\" - amazing - loved the sweet/hot sauce and the crunchiness of the wings. Great flavor!!! We ordered The Blue Cheese Burger and the Umber Burger.  Wow! Great flavor.  Great mix on the Blue Cheese based on the reviews we did decide to indulge with the Parmesan Fries.  They were delicious but we over ordered by that point and could not eat many.  It was expensive - no doubt about it.....we could have easily halved a burger and cut out the tea and that would have saved us around 23. Bucks.  It was worth it and worth tasting his yummy food!"}
{"text":"Love it. We couldn't get in Sunday night so we returned Monday for lunch. So glad we did. This is our second visit in two years and it will become a regular stop whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"As soon as we flew in to Vegas, my girlfriend and I were starving and in desperate need of comfort food. Luckily we were staying at Planet Hollywood so after we checked in and dropped off our luggage, we decided to pig out at Gordon Ramsay Burgr!   We knew it was going to be great since there was a line for early dinner Sunday night. It was packed already! We amused ourselves by taking silly photos in front of the flaming sign outside.  Once seated, we proceeded to order:  Truffle Parmesan Fries Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings Hell's Kitchen Burger Farm Burger  The Truffle Parm Fries were ok, but we do not like steak cut fries. The Onion Rings however, we devoured instantly! I wonder if they put liquid crack in them because they were so damn delicious! Next time we are each going to get our own order of Onion Rings!!! My girlfriend had the Hell's Kitchen Burger since she loves spicy foods. She loved her burger! I ordered the Farm Burger which was an uber fatty, decadent, salty gooey mess! I loved it so much! The saltiness of the bacon went well with the sharp cheddar and the fried egg helped to balance it out. My girlfriend said she had never seen me so happy before! I was in heaven!!!!  We were wayyyy too stuffed for a shake but we definitely would order one next time! We were also sad that we never had a chance to return while we were in Vegas but we have been telling all of our friends about this place since! Gordon Ramsay, you have truly outdone yourself! This is the first place we are stopping at when we return to Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Was a little hesitant to try this place after a great experience at GR steak followed by a horrible experience at GR pub and grill. I was so pleasantly surprised! The long looking line only took about 5 minutes to get through to a table, which was awesome. Our server and his busser were both friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  You HAVE TO try the jalapeño poppers. One of them still has the seeds in them but its a surprise as to which one. It comes with a bacon cheddar dipping sauce that is to die for.  I got the farm burger with duck bacon and a fried egg. So freaking delicious. My boyfriend got the chili dawg which was incredible as well.  Definitely share an order of the fries, they are plenty for 2.  The cake pops at the end were the perfect finish to our amazing meal.  I am definitely willing to pay a little extra for this strip pricing burger place, and will definitely come here to fill a burger craving!"}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had! The # 5 milkshake was very good too. Not a lot of it but pleasantly not over sweet. I am a low carber and although they offered lettuce wrap, I sacrificed the carbs and ate half the bun. OMG good!  Shared the milk shake. Beer battered onion rings were good but would have been better with twice the onion. Overall highly recommend this place. We had an hour wait but they take your # and text you when ready so you don't have to stand in line. Awesome overall."}
{"text":"Hubby had the hog burger, it was just OK. Not a bad burger but nothing he would order again. I had the farm burger and really enjoyed it. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Beer variety was pretty good.  Boddingtons and Guinness are the only nitro-beers on tap if you're into that sort of thing.  Ordered the Britannia Burger cooked to medium rare.  Came out the right color and tasted pretty good.  Cheddar was pretty mild for an \"extra sharp\" cheddar.  Chutney was a really nice note for the cheddar.  \"Just Fries\" were old tasting, ketchup was bland and boring, the curry ketchup was really good, but they could not save the fries which just were totally not fresh.  I'd try another burger from here again, but nothing about it was remarkable."}
{"text":"Came here because the game was on and wanted to be able to watch it. Once I sat down I noticed a funky, moldy smell. It was the mat on the table and the waitress quickly came by, took both mats and wiped the table down with a hand wipe. The burgers were large and I could only eat half of it. The fries were delicious, but didn't care for the seasoned ketchup. If you ask, they will bring you the plain ketchup. Service was good. Definitely a good place to come for a burger, and a game."}
{"text":"The most amazing burger I have ever had. We have been almost everywhere for burgers... often to the top rated places and I have never had a burger like this.  It was as if my taste buds woke up and said WTF.  We ate there two more times on that trip. Good prices, ask that host/hostess about waiting in line (there are options).  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"burger and fries were delicious!!! had the banana shake, which was just okay. customer service was excellent. wait was a little long though."}
{"text":"Delicious burger lettuce wrapped with duck fat bacon and relish to balance the full flavor. Perfectly spaced tables to create a cozy and fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Good diversity of  style and toppings, however meat and bread were not amazing. In a sense a bit disappointed since from Gordon Ramsay expected more. B&B from Batali in the Venetian is better burguer"}
{"text":"First off you know this spot is going to be OFF THE HOOK! I mean c'mon you have a well known Chef getting down on something so simple as Burger Menu....pfff..! no brainer!  So I wasn't surprised that this spot was amazing.  - Decor was cool. - Service was quick and easy they have an IPAD menu which breaks down the description of each item on the menu from drinks to desserts to burgers.   We ordered: 1)The Hell kitchen burger ( asadero cheese + roasted jalapeno peppers + avocado + oven toasted tomato)  This was an awesome burger, the meat was cooked perfect  each bite would melt in your mouth and had a spice from the jalapenos.   2) The Euro chicken Burger (goat cheese, arugula and tomato) this was a change of pace from your original chicken burger. As soon as you bit into it your tasting an explosion of flavors on your tongue. This one was super tender as well.  And to accompany these burgers on flavor roids.....we order the basic fries similar to steak fries. (which by the way 1 order was enough for 2 people.)   dipping sauce for the fries were a perfect match in my opinion. ( chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup)  All-in-all,  I would most defiantly stop by again when I'm in LV."}
{"text":"After 1.5 hrs of wait.......   Nothing to be fascinated about.  It's overhyped.  Burgers were so-so.  Mine was burnt.  With only burgers on the menu and they still messed up the only item. That's just horrible.    Service was bad.    Will not come back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to go to Burgr when it opened, but didn't get a chance to until the beginning of June, but it was really busy at the time, so I opted to go at a later time. I ended up going on July 2nd, and I was really excited to go because I love Gordon Ramsay. The menu isn't huge, but there is enough to chose from. I ended up getting the Yardbird, which is a chicken burger and the truffle fries. Needless to say, both were amazing and totally met my expectation. We only waited in line for about 15 minutes and go our food within 20 minutes of ordering. The waitress did an okay job, but she did make sure that we did run out of water or soda. I can't wait to go back and try another burger!"}
{"text":"What a waste of my time and money.  They were obviously understaffed, yet they continued to overseat the servers.  It took at least 15 minutes to be acknowledged by a server.  The table next to us was acknowledged before us and they were seated 5 minutes after us.  My hubby ordered Squatter's double IPA which was $8.  That's actually a very reasonable price for a DIPA in Vegas.  I ordered the Chanterelle Burger with mushrooms, figgy onion jam, and arugula.  The figgy onion jam had absolutely no flavor.  I expected a little sweetness from the fig, but there was nothing.  I could barely taste it.  The entire burger was one taste note.  I was sick of eating it after two bites.  My hubby got the Southern Yardbird burger.  He really liked his burger.  That made one of us that actually liked the food at BurGR.  We also ordered the onion rings.  I have had better onion rings in diners.  They had zero flavor and were extremely greasy.  When the bill came, I noticed that it was $3 for cheese on my burger.  Ridiculous!  Our server was highly uninterested in being friendly or courteous.  She just acted annoyed that we were there.  I will NEVER eat here again.  It's like throwing your money out a window."}
{"text":"Went to BURGR for lunch with my family this afternoon. There was a line outside so we put our name in at the desk.  They said it was a 30 minute wait and asked for our number so they could call us when a table was ready.  This was great as we could walk around the casino until then. A mere 15 minutes later we got the call and were seated.  Our waiter was pleasant and efficient throughout the meal but we had to wait at the table quite a while to get our food. Two of us ordered burgers and the third ordered a salad. I ordered the \"Hell's Kitchen Burger\" which was excellent. The meat was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  The other member of our party ordered a simple burger w/ cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, etc.  He had the same remark as I did about the patty but said that the cheese was extremely salty.  The third member of our party said the salad was very good.  They said their salad was \"very good.\"  We ordered a side of truffle fries to split among the three of us. The homemade ketchup and aioli dipping sauces were amazing! Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"After consuming nothing but Earl's, Cane's, and Panda Express for two days, a small group of my friends decided they wanted to eat something nicer than fast food. Since the majority of us stayed at Elara (Planet Hollywood), we went down and got BurGR. The wait was over an hour long on a Saturday night, so during that time, we went back up to get ready for clubbing. By the time we got back down, our table was ready!  This was the best meal I had in Vegas that weekend, so I'm really glad I joined the birthday boy. Up until that point, I had only consumed two plums, half a Cane's meal, a sandwich from Earl's, and a ton of water. I ordered the Euro burger ($15 with Total Rewards) medium rare, which had truffle aioli, arugula, and I subbed the goat cheese & oven-roasted tomato with a fried egg. I also shared an order of Truffle Parmesan Fries ($10, came with garlic aioli dipping sauce) with a friend. Both dishes were so, so, so good. One of the best burgers I've had. Not too heavy, more than enough in portion (I saved half for after clubbing), and so juicy and flavorful.  For dessert, I got the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push-Up Pops (2 for $6) as I really enjoyed the traditional STP at Gordon Ramsay's namesake restaurant in LA (now shuttered). The Vegas version was pretty disappointing cos it was waaaaay too sweet. I'm glad Jessica C. and I shared one order because I wouldn't have been able to eat two of these push-up pops.  Otherwise, definitely come here for the burgers! Can't wait to come back... I wish they'd open a location in LA."}
{"text":"It took me a hot minute to figure out why this place was called BurGR with the emphasis on the GR and the misspelling of the word 'burger' in such an odd manner. But yo, my friends didn't catch onto it either and they go to USC (some go to UCR too so we balance the highs with the lows, we a diverse bunch).   But yeah, for those of you wondering, the GR is for Gordon Ramsay, that arrogant bloke that we all know and love from Master Chef and Hell's Kitchen fame.   I actually thought the GR would have stood for Gastro Release or Great Reaming ... but no! It is simply a clever way to secretly endorse the great GR $munny$ himself. Okay, I dunno what I'm saying.  We had to wait a fairly ridiculous amount of time to seat 7 people. I don't think 7 is too big of a group especially when you're considering it's Vegas. Maybe I'm wrong though. I think they quoted us at 20 minutes, but it was definitely at least an hour. The girls working were also wearing skimpy ass clothes, but I didn't understand what they were supposed to be. They just sort of reminded me of the Hot Dog on a Stick girls. Maybe that's what they were going for though ...  I think I had just recovered from a pretty massive hang over when I came here, so a greasy burger and 'truffle' fries sounded right up my alley. To note, I was also sick. Yeah, I was sick, exhausted, and hung over in Vegas on New Year's Eve. IDGAD, IDGAF. numbersignSWOLOnumbersignYAG ... (+100 pts if you get that)  Any way, I ordered the Farm burger which clocked in at an amazing $15 price tag (sans frites to boot!) solely because it touted duck breast bacon and a fried egg. Let me tell you that a duck breast bacon ain't anything different from a regular bacon. Maybe my tastebuds don't know anything about anything, but I couldn't tell the difference. In fact, the entire burger tasted really bland. Like ridiculously so. But then again, I was sick, so I dunno!   I also got truffle fries that came with a house ketchup which was just sweet and a truffle white sauce thing? Which was just creamy and bland. I preferred the ketchup. The fries alone were salty. Sorry I can't use foodie words like umami and pungent and mouthfeel. Fries were salty. Ketchup was sweet. Burger tasted like nothing. The end. Simple as it gets.  The fries DID come in a cone though, which impressed me. That's some fancy EURO shit right there. I dug that. Regardless of serving apparatus, they were still pretty unimpressive fries. It's like handing someone shit on a golden platter. It's impressive for a second or two, and then you kind of get dismayed.   The bar next door was cool though. The bartender made me a white russian and he didn't even card me! I'm 21 of course, but me being a baby faced Asian don't help, so I guess I was glad that he was kind enough to believe in me.   All in all, not as big of a disappointment as Wicked Spoons. And seeing as how the alternative was to eat at the $77 Cesar's buffet, BurGR was a welcome choice. I'd take a good ol' Father's Office burger or Umami burger any day though. Hell, even the Counter would do."}
{"text":"Came here on the advice that this was to be the best burger ever!  Place is crowded and very popular.  But, hey, it's Vegas and this has the name of a celebrity chef on it.  Ate at the bar.  Comfortable spot, games on tv's.  Servers professional but not that friendly.   Food was good.  A solid good, but not out of this world.   What else can I say?   Been here, done this.  Would not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"Line was loong. The wait time when we went Sunday around 2:30pm was about 45mins to an hour. If you are a platinum or diamond total rewards card member then you wait half the time. We ordered the truffle burger, plain cheeseburger, goeey fries, truffle fries, and pork belly pockets. I like them all, except the belly pockets were just two small pockets (same size as those pizza rolls you buy in the frozen section). $12 for two small rolls- not worth it. Loved the gooey fries and the truffle fries. It can be salty but I love salty. Downside was having to wait about 30-40 mins for our food to arrive. This is a sunday, so i cant imagine how the wait time is on a saturday."}
{"text":"Second time here! I have to say, the food is always pretty good. But the service has been consistently slow.  This time I got the $15 Hell's Kitchen Burger (burger with avacado, tomato, and jalapeños/jalapeño spread--ALL of my faves!) And the taste of the combination was delicious, but the meat itself was dry. I imagined my Gordon Ramsay burger being juicy and full, but it was a disappointment in that regard.   I also got some truffle fries ($11) and YES! Do it! Get these! They are so good (though a smaller portion for the price) and come with two dipping sauces that are so good! The fries were the perfect mix of crunchy and soft on the inside.   Overall food is pretty good, but he prepared to wait about 30 minutes for your food (this happened both times I came). Good luck!"}
{"text":"5th time being here always great food! Which the server was a little more attentive. Burger with super juicy and definitely try the jalapeno poppers! Definitely amazing! I recommend this place highly especially if you are a diamond member or 7 Star. If not get there early so you don't have to wait long in line. In other words don't show up at noon to go eat lunch!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food. Best burger with avocado and green chilies. Wonderful hand made onion rings and truffle fries"}
{"text":"So, the food, for the most part, was amazing!!!! The service was also excellent.  We had the strawberry and oreo cookie shakes which were quite easily the best shakes I've ever had.  We had onion rings and sweet potato fries which were both great. The beer batter on the onion rings was very tasty with thick sliced onion. The sweet potato fries are accompanied by powdered sugar which is unusual but very well balanced on the crisp but creamy fries. My hb loved them and he usually doesn't even like SP fries.  We had the Euro burger and the Britianna. Both DELICIOUS! We were concerned about the chutney on the Britianna but YUM. Also, the meat was well seasoned amd cooked to medium perfectly.    The Caesar salad with kale and green apple was surprisingly good and the house Caesar dressing, omg, we loved it.  The pork belly buns were Okay.   The regular fries were unfortunately quite disappointing.  Due to the fries, and the cost $127, BURGR loses a star."}
{"text":"Lets get right to the \"Meat\" of the situation......................................  Gordon Ramsey BurGr - located at the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino, not in the miracle mile shopping section of the hotel.   Drinks - an iPad was placed at the table that had the beer and spirits displayed on it. Cool feature.  The Menu - take home souvenir.   The food - Snacks, Dawgs, and Burgers are all high quality.  If you are a fan of Gordon Ramsey you will love this place.   Now the negatives..............................  Waiting time - the place does get crowded and the wait can be an hour+ at times. But you are in a casino, so you can take a seat at the blackjack tables or play the slot machines until then. Which could also be a negative.  Noise Level - very loud!  Total Rewards Pricing - If you don't have a Harrah's card, most items will cost you a dollar more.   Over cost of the meal - burgers are in the $15 buck range, and fries are priced between $8 - $11 bucks. Plan on spending around $60+ bucks for a party of 2.   Tips - the burgers are big with interesting toppings. So you could order a few different burgers, cut them in half and share. One order of fries is enough for two people."}
{"text":"Don't let the 3-stars deceive you, because the burgers at Gordon Ramsay BurGR are really good, probably some of the best on the Strip.  I arrived there with my mom for a late lunch and was glad that we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.    I like their Souvenir Menus because that image of Gordon Ramsay just cracks me up (http://bit.ly/1WPy80n).  I wanted to try their Hog Burger because the sound of a pork patty with pulled pork and bacon just sounded awesome, but I really couldn't help trying the Hell's Kitchen Burger and then ordered a side of Just Fries with it.  Hell's Kitchen Burger -- http://bit.ly/1qL3h7l Asadero cheese, roasted jalapeños, avocado, oven roasted tomatoes, jalapeño pesto aïoli Yeah, as I expected, this was a very delicious burger.  I'm not usually a fan of burgers with a ton of toppings, but all the toppings they used with this one completely worked.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the jalapenos and cheese gave it a nice little spicy kick.  And the bun was very good too!  I'd definitely order this one again!  Just Fries  -- Hand cut fries, chipotle ketchup, curry ketchup Their fries actually didn't blow me away.  They were actually overcooked and the ketchup that came with it couldn't really save them.  The reason for the 3-star review was because for some bizarre reason, they mixed up our order with the table behind us and gave them our order first.  They apologized and served our fries while waiting for our order to arrive, but I told them to return the fries because I would prefer to eat them fresh with my burger.  Thankfully, it didn't take them long to come up with our order so I appreciated them correcting their mistake in a timely fashion.  However, I thought that some sort of compensation for that big mistake would've been nice, but they didn't offer anything which kind of soured up the whole experience.  So even though the experience was mediocre, the burger was good enough for me to come back.  And I definitely plan to return again to try more of their menu items.  In particular, their Devil Dawgs, the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers, the Hog Burger, the Farm Burger, and their Push Up Pops.  Hopefully, next time they'll get our orders right the first time out."}
{"text":"My wife and I attended Gordon Ramsey BurGR. I was highly excited.  First off.  If you are going at dinner time, prepare to wait.  We expected it.  Once seated we were greeted promptly.  We ordered two Teas and the onion rings for appetizer.  We were not disappointed I. The onion rings.  They were fantastic.  Both of our burgers were good.  Was it all worth the $50.92?  Not when you take into account that GR is ripping you off by charging $4 for a glass of tea. That is outrageous.  Will be go here again.  Probably not."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas I make it a point to eat at Gordon Ramsay BRGR at least once...twice, maybe even three times...it's THAT good!!! Pro tip: There's always a line to get seated but if you are a member of Total Rewards (The Caesar's players club) at the Platinum of higher level you get to bypass the line by showing your card to the hostess (only reason I'm a member is to skip the line at GR!)  On my last trip we ate here twice!! First on Friday night after we walked over from The Cosmopolitan & on Sunday afternoon before heading back to California.   Everything here is so good I always end up ordering more than we can eat. The jalapeno poppers are amazing as are their fries. To start we had the poppers, gooey fries (french fries loaded up with cheese, ham, and a fried egg), truffle parmesan fries, sweet potato fries, and the onion rings! All equally amazing (and more carbs than anyone needs). The three burgers I had were, The Hell's Kitchen Burger (Friday night), the Farm Burger & the Euro Burger (Sunday afternoon...I split these with a friend). For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding push pops which you have to try to understand how good they are! Everything here is always done right and cooked perfectly. Service can be slow sometimes but I don't think I've ever had an issue and I've dined here at least 10 times by now.  If you haven't tried Gordon Ramsay BURGR...what are you waiting for? It is quite possibly (dare I say it) one of THE best burgers I've ever had. Gordon Ramsay delivers, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time this past Sunday and it was just as great as the first time! We started out with the jalapeño poppers, delicious! I had to order the Britannia burger again, and it was great!  Consistently good food, and great service!!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try a burger at Ramsey's burger joint. Unfortunately I was not impressed. I ordered the hells kitchen burger, my better half the american burger and we ordered a regular fry and the truffle fry. After waiting over 25 minutes and others that were seated after us eating their meals... Our waitress shows up with the truffle fries. We finally get our burgers about 10 minutes later and they are luke warm and the meat over cooked. When I asked the waitress about our regular fry order she just smiled and said, oh I may have left that off of the order.  I expected so much more. The skirts on the waitresses leave very little to the imagination.. Maybe that is to distract you from the slow service and mediocre burger. Wont spend $60 on burgers at this place again. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed. It was about a half hour wait time, but it was nice because the hostess will have you enter your phone number on an ipad and they text you when there's a table (so you can just shop around Planet Hollywood as you wait.)   Very trendy, modern, tech savvy restaurant with lots of people. We sat at a booth and they gave us an ipad to view the menu. We ordered two different burgers one was the Hell's Kitchen Burger, also ordered Truffle Fries, and the Hummus and Pita Bread.  I don't like burgers too much, but I had several bites of the Hell's Kitchen Burger. It was pretty good my girl friend seemed to like it. A very gourmet burger. I think the other burger my guy friend ordered was the American Burger and he devoured that pretty quickly. Truffle fries were really good (I still like Umami's truffle fries a little more ..) The truffle sauce was deliciously addicting though. The pita bread was warm and toasted. The plate also came with a side of random vegetables that went well with the hummus. It was a lot of food and very filling. The food in general was a bit too salty for my taste, but otherwise it was filling and satisfying. As for dessert, we didn't get any, but the menu offered a variety of milk shakes. Didn't order any drinks either, but had a FAT TUESDAY  beforehand as we walked around Planet Hollywood and that was great (mango and blueberry ftw.)  Service was great."}
{"text":"It was a shame we ran out of time as I really wanted to come back here. Amazing food. Best onion rings I have ever had. I had the Earth Burger which was delicious. One of those places where I wish I had a larger stomach to eat more. Must go in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am a burger lover. Good but not the best compared to other burger places. I got the Britannia Burger (cheddar w/ mango chutney)...and I tried my friend's Blue Burger (blue cheese) and Euro Burger (truffle aioli and goat cheese). I liked mine the best. I think the patty was decent. Their bun is soft, but I thought they put way too much butter/margarine on the inside of the buns. It just felt greasy. Sometimes its not the actual act of putting an ingredient but could be the quality or amount that makes it taste kinda gross after eating. Secondly I got one of their shakes that they call \"Sugar Fix\" it was waaaay too sweet!  The shake part of okay, but the pudding that they put in it is super sweet. So my bad for ordering that. I love milk shakes but that shake was not good, I drank less than a quarter of it. Overall, good to just try out BurGR. Their fries are good though! They have regular and sweet potato fries :). Give this place 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Went with a friend cause we both thought it would be cool to eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We weren't disappointed. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger with assured cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, and avocado. It was cooked to perfection and tasted really good. For my side I had the Truffle Parmesan Fries which were really tasty but thought the price ($10) was a bit steep for what I got. Lastly for dessert picked up the Shake #4 Creme Brûlée pudding + Oreo Shake + Oreo Cookie. It tasted fantastic :). All in all the experience was really good and the customer service was great. When I come back next time I'll probably skip on the Truffle Fries as they weren't really that good to warrant the price tag."}
{"text":"I wasn't a burger person but came for the Gordon Ramsay hype. We had truffle Parmesan fries to begin with, the fries is ordinary but with the truffle aïole sauce it was really good. I got the hill's kitchen burger and it was the best burger I've ever had. The burger was not dry nor greasy. The hint of spiciness from the roasted jalapeño peppers made it so delicious. Brought the whole flavor to another level. I think Gordon is very good with the flavor and the texture of the foods he create. This burger joint was the most surprising meal for me in this trip.  The decoration of the restaurant is very modern and fun. The fire display in the transparent wall with their logo is eye catching. The waiter who served us was very friendly and not seemed hurry even it's busy. It showed professionalism. The only thing I  DONT LIKE about is the servers' uniform. It's a spandex nylon texture denim look top that shows every inch of the person's body. IF the person has a good body shape it will look good but most people don't have perfect shapes so it is not a pretty picture. I think the design was originally made for Gordon or people like him who does ironman triathlon. Anyways. I don't want to continue on this insignificant topic. It's just details I noticed. Overall. It's very good. I'll definitely go again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"My BF and I decided to grab a quick bite somewhere and ended up here at BurGR, since we were staying at Planet Hollywood anyways.   There were plenty of seating around 3PM and the restaurant was quite empty, but the hostess still made us wait 5 minutes. Lol! Anyways, our waiter was really attentive and quick. They have the coolest menus ever! It's folded on top of your napkin, and once you open it, there's a picture of Gordon Ramsay. You can also keep the menu as a souvenir too! The drinks are all on the Ipad.   We ordered the Hog Burger which consisted of mangalitsa pork, cheddar, arugula, and maple butter. The meat was juicy! However, the burger was lacking in flavor. We also ordered the Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings and it was heaven! They give you two dipping sauces- chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. Had about a 40 minute wait, which was fine because we were in a casino and they sent you a text message when your table is ready.  There were three of us and we all had three different burgers. They were amazing.   The atmosphere was great. It has the feel of a nice, sit-down restaurant, but also gives off the bar feel. We enjoyed it. Our waiter was awesome. Was good about suggesting items. We wanted to order a chicken appetizer of some sort and he suggested with the three of us to go the wing route if we liked wings because it was more bang for our buck. Boy was he right. They were great.  I will be back on my next road trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I FINALLY went  today to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, with some friends visiting from out of town...It was worth the wait.  I ordered the Farm Burger and this was the best burger I have ever had!  I find it funny that an English chef created it.  I am normally NOT an egg on a hamburger fan and especially NOT an over easy egg, but this worked!  I wanted to dislike it so I would be tempted to return...EPIC fail on my part!  The sweet potato fries were awesome, although I couldn't taste any spice in the sauce.  Next time I will stick with water to drink or one of their killer milkshakes, $4 for a small glass of soda, even with a couple of refills is too much money.  But the hamburger and sweet potato fries were so good that I can look past that.  :)"}
{"text":"You must try the Hell Kitchen Burger (asadero cheese, jalapeño and roasted tomato) i recommend to have it medium rare and if you have a big appetite try the gooey fries (cheddar, smoked gouda, salami and egg).  The fries serving is kinda big for one person.  The draught beer menu has little options, but the Magic Hat 9 i drank, paired very well with my selection of burger.  Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"The second best burger I've had in my life! It's worth the long wait (hour and half) next to the broiler wall (what's that about? But it looks cool.) Worth the annoyance of underhanded theatrics where some people blatantly circumvent the line and bribe the hostess for prime seating (and she accepts the corrupt incentive), worth the slow service (where did our server go, is he even on duty anymore)  ...But boy, is it worth that atmosphere. All that frustration and vexations for a burger that when you bite into it you can't even begin to speak because of it's hold on your taste buds. You're lucky, the food is divine or this would be a back handed review."}
{"text":"Easily the best chicken wings I have ever had.  Wait, what?? Yeah, I said it - the BEST chicken wings I have ever had.  They are perfect.  Blue cheese crumbles on top of a perfectly fried wing with just enough buffalo sauce.  I have been to BurGR 6 times now (I live in LA) and the wings have never disappointed.    The line can be a bit much sometimes, but it moves pretty fast. Their desserts are also amazing.  The crème/oreo shake is awesome and banana one is good.  The farm burger is their most popular one.  Hummus is unique and high quality with extra thick salt crystals.  No kidding, the food here is second to none.  Not fancy and not a place I would take someone for a classy night on the town, but......BUT....if you want excellent quality food and a fun atmosphere, give it a go.  ---Had to update the review. As much as I have loved this place and eaten here at least 10 times, I have noticed that the quality has dropped off a bit. Particularly on the wings. They stopped adding thick blue cheese crumbles and now just use this blue cheese salt-type seasoning. The hummus doesnt have as many plump veggies and rock salt. The food is a bit dryer than before. That being said, it still is a great spot, but these cost-cutters have made a difference in the overall experience. Not a must-go anymore when I'm in vegas."}
{"text":"5:25 PM 2/28 Regular fries are delicious. Had the Hells Kitchen burger and it was....okay.  The meat wasn't seasoned. I had to add salt and pepper to the actual burger! I ordered my burger medium and it was more on the medium rare side.    I will try it again and order something different.  3 stars ****************20 minutes later*****************  After all that.  The bartender asked me how I liked my burger and I explained it was good but I asked for medium and it's medium raw so he looked at it and said that the cooks cook it a little under, that's what they do. To this I said medium is medium in any restaurant and if you knew that they cooked under you should've told me when I placed my order so I could order it medium well. At this point he started to get arrogant and began to challenge me so I asked to see the manager.  I explained in full detail the incident to the manager and he not only didn't apologize, he said \"I doubt that the bartender....\" At that point I was livid and disgusted it that he would've question the incident. He finally apologized (after I asked for one) and comp'd my meal but I wasn't looking for a free meal, I was looking for good service!  A few minutes later I walking around and said to my friend \"Gordon is a stickler about meats cooked to proper temp-he would never allow his cooks to cook under temp!\"  No I won't be back.  1 star."}
{"text":"Best burgers on the strip.  Located inside planet hollywood. The wait now (fall 2014) isnt as long as the wait when it first opened up, so don't be afraid to come by and check it out guys! I know as a yelper, reading about waits really deter me from going to a place, but it honestly isnt bad nowadays. I went during prime time  friday evening  for dinner and wait was about 20 minutes give or take.  FARM BURGER - get it. its to die for. the burger meat is amazing and juicy. They do it just the way you want it. its SO GOOD. I always have to cut mine in half and eat it in halves because its so big.   TRUFFLE FRIES - SO YUMS. they also bring out this amazing ketchup and some type of BOMB aioli sauce. listen to all the other yelpers on here and order the truffle fries.  I've been here several times and I always order the same thing, so I don't have any other opinions on the menu items, hahaha. I'm a creature of habit ,what can i say. However, the interior is nice and roomy, and I love the fire that they have displayed in the front of the restaurant. If you're looking for great burgers at a great cost, come here!  TIP: DO NOT FORGET YOUR TOTAL REWARDS PLAYERS CARD. it saves you money on every item on the menu."}
{"text":"My husband and I are a big Gordon Ramsey fan so we couldn't miss eating at one of his restaurants. I must say I absolutely loved it! The whole experience! The service is great, the ambience is busy and noisy (it's vegas baby) and the food... Ahhh the food! Delicious! Well made and fun! My favorite thing now is shake #4 The crème brülee pudding + Oreo Shake + Oreo cookie!! Oh my! Absolutely wonderful! The type  of thing you never forget and crave all the time!!  We will be back to vegas on July and I can't wait to go to Burgr again!!! Thumbs up Gordon!"}
{"text":"Mike and Enrique, our waiters were fabulous! Food was incredible, and couldn't ask for a better time. Coming to try more of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants next time."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends and everything was soooo good! We definitely all walked out with happy bellies. Unfortunately, I forgot the names of our burgers and dishes. I waited too long to write this review :/ However, I'm sure everything is just as yummy. Service was good. It took awhile for someone to take our order tho, but it was super busy. You definitely have to start out with some onion rings. They. Are. The. Bomb! Finally a place that lives up to the hype. A definite must stop for anytime I'm in Vegas from now on!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing, well, except for that one thing the whole restaurant is designed around. Everything else though: amazing.  So there's a line that wraps around this place to get in. They don't take reservations but they will allow you to wander all over the Planet Hollywood after you've put your name down; so come with some shopping priorities.  Once you get in you appreciate the Vegas Pomp of the place. The walls are made of fire, the drink menu is an iPad, everyone who works here is more attractive than us normies and the jeans are Gordon Ramsey BurGR brand. It's a strip place and yet the prices are very reasonable for it's location. Then again, it is the planet hollywood.  The liquid refreshment is exemplary: margaritas were top shelf, I had beer on tap I've only seen on tap at high end specialty establishments. Great stuff. The fries came with ample dipping sauces (ketchup/mayo) and were spectacular. Unfortunately...  The burger, which was the Pork burger, was dry and relatively mediocre. The waitress recommended it as a favorite, and maybe it is, but it had like four dry ass ingredients and did not inspire me. I was taken aback. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. It was roughly backyard BBQ quality, and I was hoping for something special. It may have been just my burger.   Overall a great experience, but choose your delicious cow murder carefully."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay needs to do a Kitchen Nightmare episode at his own restaurant. Maybe we had an off day but no way is this a great burger--it's an o.k. burger at best. First of all, the meat is not a great cut. To me, it seems like regular 85% fat ground beef. The biggest problem was over cooking. There were four of us and each of our burgers were over cooked. I specifically told the waitress I wanted my burger pink all the way through so I asked if I should order rare or medium rare...she said medium rare because rare has a very red center. My burger came with just a tiny bit of pink in the center; essentially it was medium to medium well. The other people in our group ordered medium but they got burgers cooked well; not a speck of pink.   As for the flavor, it was fine but nothing special. There are 20 burger places on the strip that make a burger like this. The truffle fries were so-so--sort of tasteless and I had to add salt. The onion rings were very good but the breading falls off easily.  There are tons of wait staff hanging around--I've never seen so many extra servers milling about. Our waitress was friendly and attentive.  The wait at 4:00 p.m. was 1.5 hours for a table (I love the texting service!) which is crazy...it's all about the hype. I think BLT Burger is SO MUCH better--much better quality of meat and they cook it the way you order it."}
{"text":"The Hell's Kitchen burger was okay and nothing to write home about.  The parmesan fries were good.   The wait is crazy long."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance went last night it was great! Had the onions rings as appetizers they were yummy, they had a good mix of breading and onion and the garlic parm on top was phenomenal, we each got a burger both were excellent the hells kitchen and Euro burger I would recommend! The shake for desert was great had creme brule pudding with Oreo Ice cream, the place it's self is very nice and a friendly atmosphere, expect a wait but the line goes by fast"}
{"text":"Customer service from our waiter was amazing, texting when your table is ready, awesome. Food, Delicious.  We ordered the jalapeno popper shooters, and everyone had one of them. The sauce they were in and the jalapeno popper were amazing. Presentation was cool as well. Would definitely recommend getting these again.  The milkshake we got, had like a super thick rich chocolate pudding on top? It was delicious.  Also, the burger was super juicy and delicious. The waiter told us all the burger meat was soaked in butter prior to cooking, and that no matter what cook you get on your burger it would be moist. It definitely was. I had problems figuring out what I wanted, and he definitely had recommendations depending on mood."}
{"text":"Oh my God. I'm not even a burger person but this is yummy. Cool ambience in the Planet Hollywood casino. Decent prices, super filling burgers. Very rich. Drinks were also good. Had a great time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to BurGR in Vegas because we are obsessed with Masterchef and huge Gordan Ramsey fans. The design of the restaurant was so cool and I was really enjoying the ambiance - cool outfits, fire walls, old school diner feel. We had to wait in a line to get seated which was kind of annoying since people kept trying to bypass the line because they didn't know it existed.   Once we sat down, we got explored the menu. The iPad menu that showed pictures and descriptions of each item was really cool and such a creative idea. We shared a bottle of Pinot Grigio and ordered the onion rings which were good, but we probably could have done without them.   We ordered both sweet potato fries and regular fries. I loved the sauce that came with the regular fries (chipotle ketchup) but I prefer savory sweet potato fries over these, which had powdered sugar on them. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was sooooo good, but I definitely thought it could have been spicier. My boyfriend got the Farm burger which he loved because it's English like him. They were both so good but we felt pressured to finish them and we could barely move after all that food.   Overall, I was satisfied with the experience and would consider going again. But there are many more Ramsey restaurants to try in Vegas so I'd definitely do something different next time!"}
{"text":"very friendly staff. ordered the truffle burger, onion rings, and sweet potato fries... loved the fries and onion rings!! fries were not too sweet and the dipping sauce was good, a little sweet. the onion rings were crispy and the aged white cheddar on top tasted great together, 2 dipping sauces come with it. The truffle burger was a bit overwhelming with the strong flavor, a little too much acidity to it too (maybe from the slaw dressing). Finally got this place off my bucket list. I still want to try the Gordon Ramsey steak but I will be back to try out the other burgers here too..."}
{"text":"ATTENTION: FOOD POISONING ALERT   My friends and I ate here. Two of us ordered the Gordon Ramsay burger which comes with a pork patty.  The server whom I do not remember the name of touted it as being the Kobe beef of pork. We ordered it medium but I guess it wasn't cooked well. My friend and I who got the same burger both got food poisoning. He had intense, and explosive bouts of diarrhea whereas I had it way worse. I vomited over 25 times and also had diarrhea. I was flipping 180s on the toilet all night. The next day I was nauseous the entire day and had diarrhea and couldn't even keep down water. My visit to this restaurant ruined my entire Las Vegas trip. The worse part of it all was that the burger itself wasn't even all that good. If I were you I'd go for the farm burger it was less expensive and tasted better. But overall, this place was nothing special. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Well, I couldn't say anything wrong about this restaurant from stepping in to stepping out. The man himself Gordon Ramsay was not there but maybe you would think he was. Such was the quality of our food. In saying that it shows he must have one hell of a top team working in the kitchen. Anyway to start we had walked past once before and there had been a long queue so we expected the same when we went ....but not so. We did not have to wait at all. Our waitress was outstanding in service, manner and friendliness. Shame can't remember her name. ( Shortish, slim , dark hair.?..maybe South American..?..maybe can put a name to that person. Haha!!! I would definitely remember if I heard it). Half way through our meal our waitress went off shift and a waiter came on, who was just as good as the young lady. So, full credit to the waiting staff. Now to the food. So many burgers to choose from, from which I chose the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  I was not disappointed!!!I got to say it must be the best goddam burger I have tasted.  Out of this world!!!. We had also ordered the Gooey fries and as it says they were gooey to perfection. Dessert to follow was a shake  consisting of oereo and Creme Brulee pudding. Delicious to boot. The atmosphere inside is good too....though adjacent to a casino floor it is not too noisy, not stuffy and pleasant to sit in. Overall would highly recommend to anyone. Fantastic food , service and ambience ...and the price not too bad either."}
{"text":"Being huge fans of Gordon Ramsay, we had to try this place out!the wait wasn't so bad-- just about 25 minutes on a weekday. The service was great, and the food was very good! I especially loved the sauces that came with fries. We also ordered the super tall milk shakes, which was really sweet but still very tasty. The price wasn't too bad forVegas either. Overall a good place to go if you don't want to shell out $$$$$."}
{"text":"I could honestly write this whole review about how delicious the onion rings were but for the lack of room I will just talk about how amazing my experience was overall.  I have been dying to try this place for years and when I finally got her I was in awe. Only Gordon Ramsay would design a restaurant with a wall made completely out of glass and fire. Coming here I was prepared to go all out when it came to both the drinks and food. I ordered the chili dog, onion rings, original burger and coffee shake...I know thats A LOT but hey you have to take advantage of the situation especially if Gordon Ramsay is involved.   The onion rings were so crunchy and seasoned to perfection. Just writing this post my mouth begins to water. The shake was crazy too. There was chocolate pudding on the top and coffee shake on the bottom. A serious sugar overload but went great with the whole fancy diner feel of the whole place. The burger and hot dog were also delicious. Both loaded with all sorts of toppings that I would have never expected to be so delectable.   If there is such a thing as an orgasm in your mouth then this place will be sure to give you one."}
{"text":"Went Saturday night.  Place was packed.  Hell's Kitchen burger was great.  Cooked exactly as I ordered.  Kelsey and Joshua took great care of our table and were informative, fast and efficient.  The banana shake to finish the meal is a must! Great uniforms!"}
{"text":"It is a requirement when you go to Vegas to try at least one Chef Restaurant. We chose this place. The burgers were very good. I had the mushroom burger which was very flavorful. My brother had the farm burger which he enjoyed. The hubby had the Gordon special which was very good. We also ordered onion rings which was plenty to share.      The food was good, but it was overpriced, but then again it is Vegas."}
{"text":"I ordered a shake (#3), the pork burger, and shared an order of onion rings with my husband. The pork burger was so salty that it was inedible, and I typically love salt. :\ The onion rings were okay, but they came with a pile of cheese on them, and we weren't expecting that. My husband loved his burger (the farm burger) but agreed that mine was inedible due to the salt. The waitress didn't ask anything about the burger even though it was clear it only had a few bites out of it. All in all, I wouldn't pay $75 for that experience again. I'd much rather go just about anywhere else."}
{"text":"Place was good.. We just got there before the rush.. Had some appetizers.. Service was excellent as well.. Food was ok.. I've had worse, I've had better.. Got some sort of noodle salad.. Dressing tasted funky.. Noodles and veggies were fresh.. Chicken was great.. Dressing was blah.. Pork belly tacos.. Were ok.. I've had some in Hawai'i that were to die for, so I guess it's not fair to compare.. Fries were fresh cut and sauces were really good.. Over all an ok experience.."}
{"text":"YUM! Tried the chicken sandwich (can't remember the exact name but it's the only chicken sandwich on the menu) It was fantastic! Their cheddar ranch is out of this world. I loved the truffle fries and garlic dipping sauce. Maui onion rings were pretty but I liked the fries more. The jalapeno poppers were fantastic! The service was great and the place has a cool atmosphere. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Dined with the family last week on vacation. As a fan of the show, I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and parm truffle fries and thought it was very good aside from the price. We ordered 3 burgers, one order of fries and some drinks and spent $75 after tip and tax. Took two stars off for the cost alone. I do believe Christina from Hell's Kitchen was expediting in the kitchen while we were there."}
{"text":"The burgers were really Good.  lil bit overpriced had to order fries separately.  We expected to eat the best damn burgers but its taste awesome just not as fancy as I thought probably overpriced because it is Gordon's but he didn't make the burgers.. lol... They had a nice setting, seats were perfect for me.  Expect a long wait due to popularity."}
{"text":"Tried the Hells Kitchen and Mushroom burger! So delightful! My meat actually came out perfect, which rarely happens at burger restaurants. Flavors were on point and I super loved the Cookies and Cream Milkshake! Ordering from the iPad was a bit confusing at first because our waitress didn't tell us exactly what to do with it. We finally figured it out on our own when we saw only drinks and desserts listed in the iPad. I appreciate the survey with the bill at the end of the night."}
{"text":"This place seems to always have a line... But the good news is, it moves pretty fast.  I got the chanterelle burgr Which was very flavorful... And very filling. My friend and I shared an order of the Truffled Fries... The truffle dip was VERY yummy, the house ketchup was just meh. I also got the butterscotch and banana shake... It was super good, not too sweet, you can taste the fresh banana in it, and the butterscotch bit was actually pudding, which made the shake a bit more interesting. I liked this restaurant, but I'm not completely sure it's one I'd return to next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I gotta say, probably one of the Best burgers I've had In a long time. Being gluten intolerant, I opted for no bun. However I'm sure they taste as amazing as they look. Great house made ketchup and chipotle ketchup was my favorite. Try the Hell's Kitchen burger -"}
{"text":"The best burger I've had in Vegas hands down. Stop searching and come here immediately.   First of all the restaurant is conveniently located in Planet Hollywood and the hip design compliments the food perfectly.  It is the hip but professional joint everyone desires to have.   Next the fries. Everyone raves about the truffle fries so I had to try them. I am not a big fan and these didn't really change my mind. They were good but nothing that blew my mind away. I enjoyed the regular fries more with the Honey Jalapeño Mayo sauce. One of the best dipping sauces I've ever had.   Finally the burger. Wow. I had the famous Hell's Kitchen Burger and was not disappointed. It was cooked exactly how I asked and the combination of flavors blew my mind. I haven't enjoyed a burger like that in a very long time. Must try this burger while you're in Vegas.   Overall a great environment with great food for a reasonably priced Vegas restaurant. I will definitely be coming back here on every Vegas trip from here on out."}
{"text":"A lot of hype but lacks any true quality or imagination. Average food and overpriced at that. Another tourist trap to fall into. Skip the lines and BurGR and your save yourself time and money."}
{"text":"Was super exited to eat here. We had a table wait time of 1 hr and 15mins which was understandable. What made me give 3 stars is that it contradicts what Ramsey is known for... After we got seated everything was going normal. The drinks orders then our entrees were ordered.... After that, meals for other tables kept coming out and coming out and our table was still empty...30mins pass.... 40 mins pass.... 1hr! Seriously?! Wouldn't Ramsey scream at the top of his lungs for this?? And at the end I got a tiny burger that was not that great. I was very disappointed and very sad because he is one of my favorite chefs."}
{"text":"BEST BURGERS IN VEGAS!!!!!! I wish they would open one in Florida! The line wasn't that bad! If your eating somewhere that has a long line it's gotta be good!  Our server was awesome, Very quick and funny! We got our menus and ate with our eyes. Everything looked so good. We had just landed from a 4 hour foodless flight so we were hungry! I ordered  the American burger. My husband ordered the uber burger and we also decided to get the fries and onion rings! The onion rings came to our table very quickly and where gone even quicker! THE BEST ONION RINGS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!! They had a generous amount of Parmesano-reggiano sprinkled on them and  some chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip that tasted like sour cream and cheddar chips when you dipped them in it! Soooooo goooood!!!!! Our burgers were next and they where beautiful! I had to try to figure out how I could take a bite of it and get everything on the burger in my mouth at once! It was sooooo good! The meat was cooked perfectly the toppings tasted like they where just picked off the farm! We where soo full that we had to take the fries to go! Everything was so good! We had a lot of good food while we were in Vegas. We don't gamble so we were there for the shows and the food! We splurged on our meals because we wanted the best and we got it! Burgr was Definitly in the top 5 places we have EVER eaten at!"}
{"text":"I can finally say I've eaten at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant! And oh man. It was pretty good. I kept my expectations pretty low going into it, and I am so glad it turned out to be worth the wait and the GR hype.  The burgers were the perfect size and the flavors were on point. Ahh and the truffle fries? Amaazing. Ask for the curry ketchup. You won't be disappointed.  And definitely do not leave without getting one of those dessert shake concoctions. We had the coffee with chocolate hazelnut pudding, and I am totally ready to head back to Vegas just for that!  Make sure to make reservations or put your name on the list. The place didn't look too busy when we walked by, but turned out there was an hour and a half wait?! They text you when your table is ready though, so we walked around and hung out upstairs in our room til the table was ready."}
{"text":"We got there a few minutes before it opened and there was almost no line so we got seated as soon as the doors opened up.  We had a good view of the kitchen and Christina from Hell's Kitchen was in the kitchen running the show.  Due to this I figured the Hell's Kitchen burger would be an appropriate choice and it did not disappoint.  The sweet potato fries and the sauce they came with it, ridiculously good.  Everything about our lunch was top notch and while the bill is stout, its worth it for what you get considering it is a vacation spot for most.  As a local not sure I could justify it being your go-to burger spot."}
{"text":"First of all this place always has a line, I passed by it 3x and decided to go when it was least crowded. Second, the burgers are good but not worth the wait in line. I mean they are gourmet burgers whereas I prefer a cross between juicy/somewhat greasy and gourmet. This place is all gourmet. The thing I did like though was the sweet potato fries and the truffle fries with a fried egg. Just be prepared to undo your belt buckle a notch or three."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to eat here forever!  Finally the day has arrived, and I approached the restaurant as excited as a fat kid on Halloween.    We only had about a 5 minute wait before we were shown to our table.  The server was with us instantly, and left us with an iPad to look at the drink menu. We didn't see what we were looking for, so when she returned to the table we asked if we could get bloody Mary's.  Of course!     After much time laboring over the menu we finally got our food choices nailed down,and placed our order.  I went with a special burger called the Gordon burger.  It was a burger patty, topped with avocado, cheese, roasted tomato, butter lettuce, aoli, and Fresno chile relish.  I was a little worried about the relish, and asked for it on the side,  but my fears were unfounded, because it was almost fruity, and wonderfully flavored.   This was a perfectly balanced burger.  My husband had the Uber burger, and added Chantrelle mushrooms.  He found it to be a bit cheesy for his taste, with four different kinds of cheese, but that was what he signed up for.  The onion rings that we shared are quite simply the best I have ever had hands down.    The drinks were super well made, and I complimented the bartender when I was paying for my t-shirt. He remembered our order and thanked me.   The servers were absolutely perfect.  Professionals of the first rate.  I am now jonesing to try GR steak. Minus one star because it was so dark inside that I had to use my phone to read the menu."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place of all!! Really good especially the raspberry drink. The fries are even better. Very full after finished all the fries. They have unlimited refill for raspberry tea"}
{"text":"Was seated promptly on a Thursday during lunchtime. We definitely got lucky because I saw a long line form right after we were seated! I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and thought it was pretty good. It was nicely prepared and presented well. My only complaint would be that it's not very spicy. It just has one giant jalapeño thrown on top, but no spiciness was mixed into the meat/rest of the burger. The fries were good, although I wasn't a huge fan of their unique ketchups."}
{"text":"Gooey fries, damn!!!!! Awesome experience great service.. Standup manager, always a must when I'm in Vegas. The hog burger was excellent I highly recommend. Wife is happy life is good."}
{"text":"Amazing burger and even better fries! Not a fan of the the wait time for a table or to get the food, though so don't show up too hungry.  This restaurant is inside Planet Hollywood with a cool display out front, what I refer to as the \"tiny fire rollercoaster.\"  I got the Hell's Kitchen burger with the gooey fries. The gooey fries had cheese, salami, egg and creme fraiche - life changing! Burger was cooked to perfection, as expected from a Ramsey restaurant, and so flavorful without being too spicy.  I was able to make it through half the burger and fries, and they were both delicious the next morning without being heated up.  Server was great, atmosphere was laid back and the prices are very reasonable for Vegas. I'd recommend you bump this to the top of your burger restaurant list in Vegas (and there a plenty of burger restaurants!)."}
{"text":"Very nice decoration. It was a very long line in  the first time be here. So I decide to be back again. The next time is perfect, wait just 5mins. The food is as good as his name Gordon Ramsay :))"}
{"text":"Food was good. Burger was supposed to be medium but it was medium well. Service lacked a bit."}
{"text":"My sister & I were craving burgers and wanted to eat somewhere to watch the Basketball Game. We were staying at Planet Hollywood and noticed Gordon Ramsay Burgr inside the Casino.  We actually had two different servers. We started off with a nice gentleman and I think his shift was over so a lady took over. Being a server myself, out of common courtesy it would've been nice if our first server told us that his shift ended and someone else would be taking care of us. Oh well, it happens.   We started off with Fury Chicken Wings. Instead of Bleu Cheese, we opt for Ranch. Not bad but $14 for 6 pieces!? *eye roll* As for the burgers, my sister went with the Hog Burger & I chose the Chanterelle Burger. Both of our burgers were overcooked. The only two good things were my Mojito & the Truffle Parmesan Fries. Definitely overpriced for burgers. I guess paying $15-$18 a burger is normal in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had the burger with duck bacon. Omg was it amazing.  Lot of different and unique options.  Def check it out."}
{"text":"I had a pleasurable experience at Gordon Ramsey BurGR. The hamburgers and fries had a magnificent flavor and texture. The truffle fries were to die for and come in a very large portion. Also, I would highly recommend the wings as an appetizer to kick things off. The meat just melts off the bone -- simply delicious. I have to say that it is quite pricey for a burger restaurant and the noise level was slightly disturbing due to some of the seating locations being too close together. You don't have much privacy. Nevertheless, my encounter with this establishment was satisfactory."}
{"text":"This place had great service and the burger was great. The fries were a bit to seasoned ( gave all 9 of us a tummy ache) ordered chicken burger for the kids and was still too spicy. The smoke from the casino was very overwhelming. May return sans kids."}
{"text":"I'm inspired to cook in part due to Gordon but the burger was good but not Gordon good...the truffle fries were 4 stars....poppers concept works but one has seeds with a bite which made the burger almost non desirable.  I would try it again when I'm there."}
{"text":"I loved Burgr.  The night before we went to Holsteins (which will be another review) and I preferred Burgr over Holsteins.  We went for lunch and had to wait about 15-20 minutes. Not bad.  We ordered the truffle parm fries, I had the Chanterelle burger, husband had the farm burger, and brother in law had Hell's Kitchen burger.   I ordered mine medium rare and it was perfect. The figgy onion jam gave it a really nice sweetness but nothing overpowering. I much preferred this burger to my Holsteins burger.   The truffle fries....oh the truffle fries.  So good I couldn't stop eating them, with the truffle aioli. I was so full but just kept picking at them because they were so good.  Husband liked his but preferred Holsteins burger. Brother in law really liked his.  I would definitely come back here for another great burger!"}
{"text":"Everything was great, I was so hungry when we touched down, after waiting to be seated (20 min.) I ordered all the heavy stuff on the menu; fish sandwich, cheeseburger, ect. and I was impressed. Will definitely be back as soon as we can!"}
{"text":"Went here with a buddy while attending a conference in LV.  It was quite good.  Service was excellent.  Burger choices were unique.  We had the off-menu \"Gordon Ramsay Burger\" (which I suspect is always on the menu but is a great upsell teaser) and it was very good.  Burger wasn't quite as piping hot as I would have liked.  Just I was wondering how often Gordon checks up on his quality half the restaurant got up and started taking pictures in the direction of the grill.  Yep - Gordon was blasting through checking up on things.  He stayed behind the grill, talked for a couple of minutes to the people cooking, and left.  If my burger had been as hot as I had expected this would have been five stars.  Prices are average for Vegas and less than I expect for Ramsay.  I would go again."}
{"text":"I was very amazed to find this place. definitely one of the best burgers i have had in recent times. the hog burger was my favorite. Do not miss the shakes. Keep some place for them , as i thought those to be phenomenal."}
{"text":"Went here TWICE two days back to back Saturday and Sunday and both times the service, the smile and the food was fabulous.  Medium rare farm burger both days were incredible and consistent.  Cassandra was our server but they have a whole team that helps to fill drinks, bring food, answer questions, clean tables etc. so service was big plus for me both days.  Staff is also very friendly, not pretentious.  Bring your Total Rewards players card and you save about 5% off the total bill.  It was nice to see a very reasonable priced hip restaurant in Vegas.  My pro tip. GO!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both time were amazing. My first time was ordering the farm burger with parmesan truffle fries which were both delicious, the farm burger is topped with duck breast bacon and a fried egg which was fabulous, and the fries were the best fries I've ever had. The second time I ordered the Hell's kitchen burger with onion rings. The Hell's kitchen burger was a perfect mix of spicy and soothing, and the onion rings were nice and crispy and allowed you to bit into it without any of the onion sneaking out."}
{"text":"Yep! The expected stellar dining experience only Gordon Ramsay can guarantee!!  For Appetizer, we ordered the \"Fuzzy Chicken Wings.\" Spicy & Tangy w/blue cheese crumbs! They were DAZZLING! Fell off the bone! Hmph!  For the Entree we ordered the \"Uber Cheese Burger,\" -fontina, raclette & goat cheese- I added a fried egg! O. M. G! Superb cooking technique of the meat! It's the first thing you will notice! Very Woodsy! We also ordered the American. Boring, uninspired selection I thought...NOT SO! In fact, after BOTH of those selections I can confirm I will never enjoy any other Burger again after this experience, and if I NEVER eat a burger except here, I'm A okay with that! Oh! Can't forget the Truffle Fries! My God, if you are an Atheist, you won't be after the Truffle Fries! In fact, this has to qualify as baptism! The friggin Truffle Fries are a Divine Spiritual Experience!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Playing at the tables the dealer recommend this place. Lucky, there was not a long line. I had the Hog Burger and boy, did that hit the spot! We all split some jalapeño poppers shots, fries and onion rings. Photos to follow. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"The menu has changed. Wait time for a table of 2 took about 40 mins.  Wait time for 2 hamburgers and  1 order of fries took 45 mins.  Would not come here again.  Staff was friendly, which was the only plus, because my ice-tea was refilled.  Over price hamburger and fries."}
{"text":"Best hotdog I've ever eaten and great food. Services five star as well. Understand you're going to pay a lot for a burger here, but it's a great place to eat"}
{"text":"Greetings everyone - I write this review from the afterlife as I have died and gone to Burger Heaven. We came during lunch hour, so the wait was not very long. The experience and food at BurGR were absolutely worth the visit. Our server was extremely helpful with picking a burger that satisfied our pallets and a perfect cold beer to wash it down.   We started off the meal with some of the Jalapeño Poppers and of course they were delicious. The creaminess of the ranch sauce complimented the spiciness of the peppers quite well.  The burger was cooked (ordered a medium rare) and seasoned to perfection. We also ordered fries and they were fried and seasoned perfectly. I always find myself adding more salt to my fries, but not here!  The difference in the quality of ingredients compared to your \"regular\" gourmet burger joint is night and day. Granted, BurGR is a tad bit more pricier than those said joints, but the service and food is unrivaled. We will definitely be returning here next time we visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Had the farm burger. Not bad. But not blown away either. For the price, a little expensive considering you don't get fries, but it is Vegas.   Service was great though."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night around 6:00 and the wait for two wasn't bad, about 15 minutes.   Started with the jalapeño poppers which were deliciously spicy. The presentation of them in their own dipping \"shot glass\" was fun, but made them lukewarm and soggy on one end. Burgers were cooked perfectly juicy and delicious: Farm Burger- anything with an egg on it is an A+, but when you add duck breast bacon, makes it so much better Hell's Kitchen Burger- flavors of the cheese, roasted tomatoes, roasted jalapeños, and avocado worked really well together Truffle Parmesan Fries- the fries were good, the aioli dipping sauce on the side made them excellent"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers. Everything you would expect and a little more. Every burger is SO packed with flavor, and every ingredient is packed perfectly together to compliment each other.  I ordered the Foie Gras Burger, which I will be ordering over and over, again and again. Because it was that good. Perfect.  Great for a lunch spot right inside the doors of Planet Hollywood. Sit at the bar or at a table, and watch the bustle surrounding you.   OH and the fries. Don't leave without getting the fries, any of them. We ordered the parmesan and herb crusted fries....to die for. There's different types you can order, loaded I believe is in there somewhere, but we were not near hungry enough to order those. The hot dogs aren't normal hot dogs either. Since we sat at the bar we saw every order come out and those hot dogs are special, dressed-up, enormous hot dogs. I imagine packed with flavor as well. Especially since there were endless toppings overflowing on top of each."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, I've seen every episode of every show he has done, even the little known ones overseas.  However, there is just a little something oft-putting about him having to stamp his name and image everywhere in his restaurants.  I mean, yeah we get it, this is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, we don't need to be reminded of it everywhere we turn our head.   Ok had to just make that remark, but I gotta say this place is great, just amazing burgers, atmosphere, and staff.  I personally with my burgers enjoy fries that are more thin cut instead of the steak fries style he served, and this would be my only suggestion for improvement.  Otherwise for burgers, this place can't be beat.  I suggest heading over to Gordon Ramsay steak for sticky toffee pudding for dessert if you have time, instead of the version at BurGR which is modified into push pops."}
{"text":"Meh......I have been to much better burger places.  The burgers were over done and nothing special.  Truffle fries were fishy like they had been cooked in the same oil as the Cod.  The hot dog was like a Red Hot dog.  Not a place for kids.  I would say adult only.  we won't be back."}
{"text":"I always enjoy watching Gordon Ramsay on TV but I was a little disappointed with the 'BurGRs' here. First of all, let me start with the good.   The ENVIRONMENT it's pretty modern and definitely looks like something of Gordon's taste. The fire in the window is a nice touch while you wait in that crazy line. The inside is pretty huge with  ton of tables and a ton of TVs everywhere. It's also a very loud environment so this place is perfect if you have whiny kids or crying babies.   The SERVICE was okay. The food was on time and there were no mistakes in the order but our waitress didn't seem friendly and I felt rushed; that's saying a lot for someone who was dining with two young kids. The one highlight was that if you have so many people within your party, they give you a pager so you don't have to wait in line.   The FOOD was kind of a disappointment. I ended up ordering the Uber Cheeseburger. I ordered this medium and it turned out to be a little dry and the taste was pretty bland. I didn't feel satisfied after eating it. For the PRICE of 15.00, it just wasn't worth it to me.   Overall, I wouldn't eat here again with all of the other burger joints in Vegas to choose from."}
{"text":"Was really intimidated by the menu!!  Ended up ordering the bacon burger with the egg over hard.  It was really good!!   Decor is awesome! But don't sit in the front! It's next to the outer door and that breeze is freezing in the winter."}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way here. If you're here for an actual tasty burger do NOT eat here. The farm and American burgers here are tasteless and dry/juiceless. They look good for Instagram pics but when I came here for the grand opening, they tasted mediocre at best. I was disappointed. A lot of their burgers sounds like it'd be packed with flavor but the final product is less than its parts. The fries/condiments and milkshakes however are good, which is nice. It's just a damn shame that their burgers can't even compare to Bachi Burger, Holsteins, In-N-Out, Bacon & Truffles, Shake Shack or Fukuburger. Hopefully it improves but BurGR has some serious stiff competition to beat if they even want to be included on a list of heavy hitters. For a celebrity chef it's hard to expect much if anything but you would think such a vocal man would have more to say with his food (even though it's just his name he cashed out). Overrated is an understatement. Don't trust anyone who thinks the burgers are here cause they're clearly not talking about the taste.  Also of note the three blonde hostesses at front should be fired. They're rude and unfriendly demeanor is the exact antithesis of what their job entails but perhaps their crummy attitude reflects that of an understaffed restaurant serving hot pucks guised as burgers. Seriously what is going on in this restaurant??? How can the food AND the service be this bad? It's certainly not a matter of budget given the venue and location. Perhaps Gordon ought to do an episode of Hell's Kitchen in his own goddamn Soulja Boy sell out of a restaurant that is BurGR. Just plain awful. Any 4 star or higher reviews are suspect at best and dishonest or sponsored at worst.  FYI: San Diego best burgers: Rocky's and Hodad's NYC best burgers: The Spotted Pig and Gramercy Tavern"}
{"text":"I came to BurGR without having any sort of expectations and left only mildly impressed.  The name and the glitz surely pulls you in and upon reading the menu my interest definitely spiked.  With burger components that include chanterelle mushrooms, raclette cheese and duck bacon how could it go wrong?  Well, I can't say it went wrong but my Farm burger was a little underwhelming on flavor.  Fried egg, cheddar and duck bacon lacking in flavor?!?!  Common Vinh!  That's what I asked myself as well... maybe it was an off burger, maybe it was because my egg yolk was broken upon serving but overall the burger was just pretty good.  In fact the general consensus of the table was that the meal overall was just pretty good.  Even the much lauded Oreo shake with creme brulee pudding was a bit of a let down, sure it's labeled as pudding but adding some sugar and actually bruleeing the top would really be a great kicker.   That being said, there were some highlights.  The chili (pepper) dog was impressive and very satisfying and the onion rings had a great crunchy shell.  But taking into consideration the long wait for the table (which is totally understandable) and the 30 minute ticket time, it all seems a bit long and really drags the meal down.  Especially considering that the management staff must know they get slammed everyday.  Service was attentive and energetic without being overbearing.  Pricing is about right for being an elevated burger joint.  I would say give it a try, especially if you don't come from a town that has been hit by the burger trend.  Having more than my fair share of burgers from many parts of the country and my home town of LA, BurGR is just par for the course."}
{"text":"This is not a burger. This is a burger experience. Of course the quality of each ingredient of the burger is at it's highest. Of course the meat is cooked perfectly, and I mean perfectly. All of these things considered, and this burger still blows me away. When you take a bite of most burgers you taste each ingredient, and that's cool. With this burger you sink your teeth in, and you close your eyes and you are floating. You are floating in a sea of burger flavor, and you stare into the burger sky, and tears come to your face as you realize you have never been in this paradise before. Tears run down your face as you realize you are out of this world as soon as you swallow. Each bite is a swirl of flavors each ingredient mixing and mingling together in your mouth complementing and teasing each other. Each bite is a million kisses from the boy or girl that has broken your heart. Each bite is an orchestra hitting the hardest and best note of the entire performance. Each bite is bliss. Each bite is love. This was a true experience, and I could go on and on, but like this burger all great things in life must come to an end."}
{"text":"Great service. Loud atmosphere which was unexpected, but still fun and enjoyable. Food was delicious even though fries were not included."}
{"text":"Today we received Outstanding service at Gordon Ramsey burger!!!! If I could give them a 5+++++ stars I would. The service from the minute we got there till we left was great. Our server was extremely nice and with such a positive attitude. We had the sweet potato fries, spicy chicken sliders, Cesar salad and jalapeño poppers. Thank you so much for your amazing service!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.  As a VIP for Total Rewards, I was able to skip the incredibly long line and enjoy no wait for a table.   The food was fresh and the meal was fantastic."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Make it your mission to eat here at least once on your trip!   Be prepared to wait.  We went on a Sunday night around 6ish. We only had to wait about 25 mins.  Not bad at all.  I would of waited 2 hours to eat here! You can grab drinks at the bar and drink them in line so that was very nice.  The only downside to the waiting part was that the line forms right in front of a cool looking but HOT fire flame.  Very uncomfortable.  I got the Brittania Burger. It had English cheddar, mango chutney, and arugula on it! It was sweet and spicy. Such a lovely combination.  I'm actually looking for the ingredients at home so I can make it at home! I also got the \"just fries.\" I thought they were very good.  They are thick like a steak fry. They come with 2 yummy ketchups. One is Chipotle ketchup and the other is curry ketchup! AMAZING!   The sticky toffee pudding push pops were a perfect ending to an incredible dinner. They are not very filling; perfect portion!"}
{"text":"Finally made it. We waited roughly 20 minutes in line on a Saturday night and POOF we were in! Surprisingly the line moved really fast. There is always a line at this place.  The hostesses were plastic, especially the one at the hostess stand handling reservations and seating. Thank goodness our server was personable. He provided five star service from beginning to end.  I ordered the chicken burger \"Farm Burger\" style. It was just okay. The duck fat bacon offered an odd taste. We also ordered the Fury Wings and \"Just Fries\". The Fury Wings were good. The fries - just okay.  I really wanted to love this place. Sadly, I didn't."}
{"text":"Service: No complaints! Server was very nice and attentive!  Atmosphere: Contemporary and nice! There is this neat sign near the entrance that lights up with fire   Food: One of the BEST places on the strip for a burger. My favorite is the Euro Burger. Their shakes are also very good. Be careful though the shake and burger combo is too filling for most. I suggest sharing your shake with another person.  Price: Reasonable. Around $15 for a burger. Unlike some other places, you do have to order fries separately (which runs around $8 to $13)   Overall: Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Chocolate hazelnut pudding with coffee milkshake was absolutely delicious!  Burgers were okay but I wouldn't pay avg. $15 per burger again for the taste. Too wide of grill marks made a burnt taste. I had a chanterelle burger and my wife had an American burger. We had regular fries wide cut which I'm not a fan of. The curry ketchup was delicious. Tasted like masala sauce.  Milkshake came right away and was to die for but kitchen took about 45 minutes to get burgers out. Then another few min to get fries. How hard is it to grill a burger and deep fry fries?"}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this restaurant. We got a table quickly but it took forever for our waitress to come let alone get our drinks. Don't come here if you're in any sort of rush. I can't have gluten or dairy so I ordered the easiest option possible... A burger and fries. Allergens aren't listed on the menu so you have to ask about everything. I paid 22 dollars for literally a piece of burger with a piece of lettuce on top. Absolutely no toppings nor was I asked if I wanted any. I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Being a Gordon Ramsay fan, I had to try this place on a recent trip to Vegas.  I was worried it would be over-hyped, but I was pleasantly surprised. It took about 15 minutes to be seated for 2 people on a busy weekend night. Not bad at all. We started with the onion rings, and my god, they were incredible. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and the flavors were awesome. We had the Hell's Kitchen and Chanterelle burgers. Definitely some of the best burgers I've ever had. Prices aren't terrible considering it's on the strip. Food arrived in a timely manner and our waitress was nice. Not horrible service, but not amazing either. I would definitely return here!"}
{"text":"This place is located within Planet Hollywood, near one of the many entrances. If you or someone in your party has I believe Platinum/Diamond/7 Stars they will let you skip the long line and be seated shortly. The burgers here do take some time to make, so I would suggest ordering some truffle fries to hold off on the wait.  Our table had the Chanterelle Burger, the Gordon Burger, and an order of Truffle Fries. The truffle fries were delicious! It didn't have that strong, truffle oil smell that I would usually get when order truffle fries elsewhere. The flavor was pleasant, with a hint of truffle, but not being overpowered by a truffle oil smell. The cheese on top also complimented the fries, rather than drawing the focus to them. The sauces used to dip the fries in, which consisted of a ketchup like one, and a creamy one.  I had the Gordon Burger, and the meat and bun was amazing! The meat tasted fresh, was very pleasant, and was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The buns were also very well made. I wasn't too big a fan of some of the inside toppings, like the duck bacon tasted a bit too salty and I wasn't too big a fan on the bell peppers, but this mostly has to do with my choice of toppings. I feel if I ordered something like the Euro Burger or the Chanterelle Burger, I would have enjoyed it a lot more.  Overall a great place, and worth going to if you can skip the line. I don't know if it would be worth waiting the long wait for though."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are the best ever !!!!!!!  Deliciously tangy with just a touch of spice :) Probably the best wings ive ever ate 'nnnn"}
{"text":"What a great experience! I was sat at the counter right in front of the kitchen - very fun to watch the kitchen and how they interact! The head chef stopped over a couple times and talked with me about the food and operation. He asked what I ordered and I let him know the Truffle Burger and Truffle Fries. He said normally he likes to touch base with the patrons at the counter and let them know how he would suggest to make your burger better- but the Truffle was already perfection! He was awesome and really added to a great experience!  My waitress (who was just as awesome as the head chef) did let me know that the truffle burger has a completely different taste then Truffle fries. It has goat cheese infused with truffle - then the mix is heated and really brings out the goat cheese flavor- I love goat cheese and this was def the main flavor of the burger. It was good but if you don't like goat cheese don't get the truffle burger. Now the truffle fries were amazing and tasted of truffle!   Great atmosphere and amazing food! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Yum! Our first stop for lunch in Vegas was a total winner! The location is really cool looking - lots of flames, futuristic uniforms, and impossibly good-looking servers. My friends and I each had a burger, and we split two orders of fries.   The farm fresh burger with duck bacon, English cheddar, and a fried egg was really good. While it was recommended to me to get the burger medium (warm pink center), which I thought seemed like a good idea. It was definitely a little more medium-well than medium, so a bit drier than I had anticipated. However, it was exceptionally well-seasoned. The runny egg yolk helped too. But wait, did I mention how damn tasty it all was? It was!  The sweet potato fries were delightful, although my friends and I were mystified by the yellowish congealing fluid that was served with it (none of us remembered what it was supposed to be). The hand cut fries were also pretty good, but nothing spectacular. However, the curry and chipotle ketchups were awesome. Just awesome!  We were too full to try dessert, but damn, they looked good!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch at BurGR on our last day in Vegas. There was always a line to get in but it moved quickly and we were seated near the open kitchen. A minor issue, but the chairs for the tables are really too low. I felt like I needed a booster seat. Even my 6 ft tall husband was uncomfortable. Our server got our drinks and order pretty quickly but then it was about a 30 minute wait for our food. I was getting antsy because we had a few errands to run before our flight. When the food finally came out, it was delicious. We had the Uber cheese burger, Hell's fire Burger and the Truffle Fries."}
{"text":"BurGR is amazing! By far the best burger I have ever had! The staff is great, on par with Ramsey steak! I ordered the Farm Burger and it was awesome. My wife had the Hells Kitchen burger and it to was amazing. We shared a basket of \"Just Fries\". They were good, but what set them over the top was the two ketchups. A chipotle ketchup on one side and a curry ketchup on the other. We will be going back again before we leave Vegas!"}
{"text":"Perfectly crafted, unique burgers.  Usually speciality burgers end up being to moist causing the bun to get soggy. Here, the burger were moist with interesting topping and compiled so perfectly (they don't even fall apart when you bite into them). I personally tried the Hell's Kitchen burger which was a tad spicy. Someone else at my table had the Euro Burger with goats cheese which was excellent. Shakes are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"there's so many reviews on this place that mine will probably just get lost, so let me just say...  burgers are amazing. fries are even more amazing. add bacon to your burger. droool.  expensive, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Burger was way too overpriced! Me and my friend ordered 2 Hell's kitchen burgers, 1 truffle fries, and 2 glass of beers and the totlal came out to be 70 something including tax. Definitely not worth the money considering theres a lot of different cheaper alternatives considering theres many restaurants in vegas serving decent burgers. As for the burger, it was too underseasoned even though i liked the grilled jalapenos incorporated in a burger."}
{"text":"If you've ever watched Kitchen Nightmares, Chef Ramsay always makes it a point for a restaurant to have a very good burger on its menu. The cleverly named Gordon Ramsay BurGR has several to choose from, all ranging from $14-18.   My penchant for something hot led me to the Hell's Kitchen burger. I liked that instead of the usual pepper jack cheese, this burger had asadero with roasted jalapeño peppers instead. The burger itself was well-cooked and I enjoyed the nicely toasted sesame-topped bun. However, this burger with Mexican-inspired ingredients lacked the bold spicy flavor I was craving. On the other hand, my companions tried the farm burger, which had duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. I can never complain about a burger topped with an egg. I thought the farm burger had more flavor and came together nicer than the Hell's Kitchen burger.   For sides, we ordered truffle parmesan fries and beer-battered Maui onion rings. Truffle fries have been overdone for a while now, but I couldn't resist a good aioli dip. I wasn't a fan of the onion rings as I found them to be over-battered.   If you're coming to BurGR, forget the burgers, fries, or cocktails. The one thing you should try are the shakes. Generically numbered 1 through 5, they are really something special. Each shake is methodically layered with the shake, a pudding, and topped with a cookie. We tried shake #5, which was a coffee shake with a chocolate hazelnut pudding (reminiscent of Nutella), topped with a praline cookie. It was like three desserts in one. A fantastic treat that had us wanting more throughout the whole meal.   The service was great and the line moved pretty quickly as the table turnaround was quick. There are plenty of other burger joints to frequent around The Strip and if I found myself around PH, I would probably opt for the cheaper Earl of Sandwiches, but  the shakes here are hard to pass up."}
{"text":"This burger was literally the best burger I have had in my life. Granted, I don't eat them all of the time, but if they all tasted like this, you bet I would! The onion rings were delicious. The fries were lacking, both in taste and in texture. They were much too soft for my liking. My companion got the hot dog (I know!) and said it was ok, but kept nabbing bites of my burger! The drinks were spot on. I had no room for dessert after gorging myself on so much food. I would definitely return, but leave off the fries this time!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay,   HAVE YOU EVEN VISITED YOUR OWN RESTAURANT? Stop with the kitchen nightmares and improve this place first!   As a huge MasterChef fan, I was really hoping BurGR would live up to its hype, but really everything is sooooo average and overpriced to boot. The patty is pretty tasteless with a weird texture, which is surprising given that I asked for it medium rare and it's supposed to be cooked over some smoky apple wood or something else exotic. Pretty sure all of the 5 stars are from people who have had one too many fat tuesdays (which is also in pH and a wayy better bang for your buck)   On the plus side, great service and cool menu design! The fries were pretty good and +1 HUGE star for the aioli that it came with."}
{"text":"Ate here twice on our last trip to Vegas. I had the Farm Burger on one visit, and the Brittania on the other. My wife and son both always eat theirs plain. We LOVED these burgers, and we're burger lovers. Burgers were cooked and seasoned perfectly, Staff was friendly and helpful. They were taping Master Chef there on a third day our we would have eaten a third lunch there!  Good job, Gordon!"}
{"text":"Took FOREVER for two simple burgers. It was very very expensive and located in a casino with no cell phone service. Had high expectations but was meet with a mediocre burger joint in a inconvenient location. We will not be returning"}
{"text":"Food was very good. The menu is well thought out and executed, and I recommend items be ordered as they are presented on the menu - no real changes necessary.   Service was VERY bad. I was shocked. We sat at the bar. There are now plenty of burger places in Vegas, no reason to pay a premium price and deal with sub-par service. Groups of hosts, and servers chatting in corners. Nonchalant service. lackadaisical approach to management. I can go into detail - but I'll save that.   You'll enjoy your meal - but I honestly expected MUCH better service and a better eye to detail from the management team (it starts at the top)."}
{"text":"Had the farm burger which was okay but nothing great. Burger had no flavor and the fries, which don't come with the burger, were stale. Setting is very Hell's Kitchen like and staff is attentive and provides great service. But for the price it's just not worth it. Save yourself some cash and go grab a burger at In N Out instead ."}
{"text":"Do not leave Vegas without stopping in.  Let's get it out of the way. My only complaint was how noisy the place is ... but, it is PH and it is Vegas.  The burgers are out of this world. Price is great value.  Do not skip the appetizers ... onion rings are like nothing you have every had and even non-ketchup eaters will dig on the chipotle infused ketchup. The jalapeño poppers, served in individual shot glasses with a unique ranch/ bleu chess blend are a must ... good luck finding the one with seeds before you bite in!  We were too full for the shakes at dessert but they looked amazing.  Our server might have been the best in Vegas. Well trained, passionate about the food and the experience, she went out of her way and delivered 5-star dining service in a \"burger joint\".  For us GF diners, they will wrap the burgers in lettuce."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great and my wife and I had a bit of a wait but it was worth it. We chose to sit at the bar so we could get in a little faster and it was pretty cool. I liked being able to watch the staff in action. It appeared to me that they had a a couple managers working in the back and both were running like machines and the cooks were getting food out at a fast pace. One manager looked over every plate of food before it went out to ensure it was correct. Our burgers were fantastic and we also decided to split an order of truffle fries, definitely enough to share. They were the best either one of us had ever had, very tasty. The truffle sauce and chipotle ketchup was very solid and although I didn't go back while visiting Vegas, I was craving them the rest of our trip."}
{"text":"Everything I wanted and more. Thanks for for the great food and perfect service. Alex, the bartender, was amazing!!"}
{"text":"You have not tasted an amazing burger until you have tried Gordon Ramsey. Absolutely nobody should compare this restaurant to bachi, because it is beyond amazing.  My friend and I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and only waited for about 5-10 minutes, which was fine because it gave us time to peruse the menu and check out yelp for some tips.  I decided to try the brittania. The mango chutney made me a little hesitant, but I decided to just go for it and I'm glad I did. The mango, arugula, and sharp cheddar worked in a beautiful medley with the beef. It has this amazing sweet and savory was amazing.  My friend go the euro burger. She really loved it. I tried some of it, but it made me realize that I really don't like goat cheese.   The truffle fries were pretty great. It was actually really big. I shared with my friend and we couldn't finish it with our burgers. The sauce it came with was amazing. The truffle aioli was something else. Y'all need to hit it up!  I forsure can't wait to come here again and try the hog burger, if I'm not really tempted by the Brittania again. It was that good."}
{"text":"I tried an american burger. I was excepting a burger that is juicy, rich in flavor and little bigger for a gourmet burger restaurant.  I guess my expectations were high. Fries were good. They never let us ask for more drink. I like the design of the restaurant. Staff explained everything well.  Would i come back? Probably no."}
{"text":"Dreadful.  Abominable.  Godawful.  \"Bad\" to the 10th degree.  The meat is tasteless. The buns are stale. The toppings are paltry.  And it's all insanely expensive. I mean come on....$11 for undercooked truffle fries!!!! $16 for a tiny burger with a hard piece of prosciutto on it!!!!  If you want a so-called gourmet burger with unconventional toppings, and a better cut of meat, go to Burger Bar or Barrymore or Holsteins or Bachi. If you want a great regular burger that's infinitely better than this excuse for food, go to Smashburger or Badger Cafe. But whatever you do, avoid this godawful Gordon Ramsey ego fever-dream.  We've all heard that the Brits know nothing about good food. Well, Gordon Ramsey proves it many times over with BurGR."}
{"text":"Spent $140.00 including tip on 4 burgers, 1order fries ( shared by whole family), 1beer, 2 shakes, and 1appetizer(fried, stuffed jalepenos were totally room temperature).... better places to get burgers....I'd recommend BJ's instead...several locations in Vegas where u can pay $11 instead of $18, on a waaaay better burger...service was great though"}
{"text":"I love Chef Ramsay. Watch all of his shows!! I lived in Vegas for 21 yrs, but left before he opened any of his restaurants.  I believe the steakhouse or his Pub n Grille where in the process of being built! When I was able to go back to visit this yr (June 2014)  I knew I was going to one of his places. BurGR was the choice. It was absolutely AMAZING! Worth every dime spent!  There was 5 of us. I ordered the  Hells Kitchen burger  with duck breast bacon and the truffle fries, my best friend ordered the the Dawg and split it with her mom and they ordered a milk shake and split that  her sister in law ordered the Brittania burger and the onion  rings. We all had some of the fries and rings and even left some of the fries there was that much. All the sauces that came with the fries and onion rings were out of this world, especially the aioli sauce!! I had a bite of everyone's food and shakes and will just say that if the food we ordered tasted was that amazing, I can only imagine what the rest of the menu tastes like!!!! Our waitress Michelle was beyond super!! We found out that Chef Christina just got promoted from the steakhouse to BurGR, sadly she wasn't there that day! I was allowed to  take a few of the menus. I have a spoon from there, the stick that came. In my burger, Michelle gave me a pen and I bought a shot glass!!  I was so pleased I even sent Chef a message about it!  Definitely going back again. I have every intention of next time home I'm going back to BurGR and at least the steakhouse , but pub n grille are on my list too!! I highly recommend this and if you had bad service it's  cuz you wanted it to be bad is all I can say!! Thanks Chef Ramsay for one of the best burgers I've had in my life!! If you love great burgers, fries that are of melt in your mouth fantastic and great shakes, give BurGR a try!!! You won't be disappointed!! Let's just say it was a party in my mouth!!"}
{"text":"Well the name Gordon Ramsey's is supposed to be synonymous with excellent quality food so me and a friend decided to try it out.  The wait to get a table on a Saturday night was about 10-15 minutes. Not bad.  Once seated we got out our menus and then the waiter brought an iPad with the alcohol menu which we did not partake.  So we both got burger and the truffle fries which were excellent. Now I didn't like that I never saw my waiter for like 30 minutes while my food was being prepared and I asked for ketchup like 2-3 times and only got bbq sauce.   The burgers had an awesome taste to them and the fries as well. I would come back."}
{"text":"Weirdest name for a restaurant. Burgr?   I'm all for trying something new, but nothing on the menu actually jumped out and said, \"Try me, I won't disapoint\".  Had the Gordon Ramsay Burger, which is off menu. it was OK. Had an order of regular fries and their special or red dipping sauce. Didn't like that, it was too spicy...had to ask for regular ketchup.  This is the second Ramsay restaurant we've tried in Las Vegas. Haven't been impressed by either. This is will be the last one. Not spending any more of my hard earned money on someone else's hype."}
{"text":"I had the farm burger and my son had the uber cheese burger.   We almost cried it was so good.   The Gooey Fries are to die for and the waitstaff were fantastic.   Nothing beats this meal"}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to have friends that wanted to go here twice in the last three weeks, and I am so glad!  First off, this place was not cheap, but way less expensive than I thought a Vegas Bomb Diggity Burger Place (by Gordon Ramsey no less) would be. $7 beers, $7 fries large enough to share for the table, and a $13 burger also big enough to split.  Both times I have gotten the Euro Burger which has the perfect combination of truffle and fantasticalness (apparently that is my new favorite ingredient).  My only and biggest complaint is that this place is FREEZING. Considering how hot it is outside and both times we have been on our way to out for the night (i.e. wearing light clothing) and it has been a freezer inside! I would really appreciate it if Mr. Ramsey would turn off the AC once in awhile!"}
{"text":"We split the chanterelle mushroom burger with truffle fries. The fries are insanely good. The burger was awesome...totally worth the price.  Their specialty cocktail drinks are actually worth the $12 pricetag as they deliver on flavor and punch.  Would definitely return even though service was a little slow because they said the kitchen was backed up. Not a problem...take your time....produce good food and it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices considering it's Vegas and also it's Gordon Ramsay. The cocktails were also very good. Try everything and don't feel bad about splurging, you get a good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"So sad to give this place a 2 star rating. Use to love coming here the food and staff were great but as time went on everything has gone downhill. Last 2 visits were very disappointing and I do not think I will be coming back.  First off the hostess give first impression to the place and they are not very friendly they seem like they are over everything and do not want to be there at all. The wait staff have become rude and in a rush. The food took sooooooooo long to come out. The fries were cold and soggy which is very sad because I know if Ramsey were there he would be very disappointed. Their dishes like their cups smelled so bad like egg yolks it's disgusting and I've noticed this the past few times I've visited. The burgers were ok but not as good as they use to make them. It's so sad because this use to be the best spot to take visitors to for the best burgers."}
{"text":"The hostesses here are the worst I've encountered while in Vegas. They're unfriendly and emotionless, and they skipped over us in line! A hostess went through the line taking numbers, but skipped over us and went to the people in front or behind us. My family and I left frustrated.  The second time around, there was no wait, so we were immediately seated. The hostess wasn't welcoming. The food, however, was amazing. The milkshakes were top notch, and everything after. A little too salty, though."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. On the one hand, the food is really good but on the other hand the prices are ridiculous. My meal was $35 before tax and tip. So ignoring the prices, the 4-star rating is just for the food.   I ordered the farm burger, truffle fries, and Shake #5. I also sampled the jalapeno poppers, soba noodle salad, and sweet potato fries. The burger was really really good and the meat was a perfectly cooked medium! I loved the combination of the duck breast bacon, cheddar, and fried egg on the burger. Although I did feel like I needed some sort of greenery, maybe arugula? The fries were thick and crispy. The truffle parmesan and truffle salt on the fries made it too salty though; it could do with far less seasoning. The shake was incredible! It was creamy and super thick and surprisingly not overly sweet.   The jalapeno poppers were yummy but were a kick in the mouth. They were so spicy! I was not expecting my mouth to be on fire. The soba noodle salad was cold and refreshing but if I'm going to BurGR, I'm going to order a burger. The sweet potato fries we nothing extraordinary. I was really thrown off by the dipping sauce. It tasted kind of like vanilla pudding but it was supposed to be a honey jalapeno mayo? Weird...  Definitely give BurGR a try because I think it should be experienced at least once."}
{"text":"In town to pick up family from McCarran, decided to give BurGR a try. Line was long, but flying solo, so the bar was first come seating, sweet.  Great tap beer selections, ordered the Blue, with bacon and just fries. Burger was cooked to perfection, juicy and delicious.  Fries come in this trophy like holder, but none remain as well.  The gal sitting next to me noticed contrasting uniforms, gals dressed like something off Star Trek and dudes like ranch hands. Thanks Chef Ramsay."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving it three stars is because I had the earth burger,  which is a portobello burger and it was ok... However my husband got the buger with the fried egg and duck bacon and did not like it.  After waiting in line for 30min he did expect a great deal more flavor in a burger.  The hamburger had no flavor, grill or otherwise. The duck bacon did not bring the added flavoring as pork bacon would. The fries were standard... The spicy ketchup was good.  We both give the bananna milk shakes 5 stars as it was the best of our meal."}
{"text":"Disappointed in Gordon Ramsey's BurGR.  We arrived about 10:30 pm. We waited about a half hour to be seated, which we totally expected. We waited about 15 minutes after being seated to place our order, we then waited another 35-40 minutes for our food. The toppings on the burger were good but the burger itself had zero seasoning in the meat. The Parmesan fries were good but a little hard, like they were sitting for to long.   We are big fans of Gordon Ramsey, I don't think he would have approved of this meal."}
{"text":"I came across this place bc i saw there was a line to get in and automatically became curious. I waited in line because I wanted to see what the restaurant had to offer. I don't like burgers at all, but I was willing to give this place a try and I was Not disappointed at all, to say the least. The wait was like 30mins or so which was not bad considering i was still working up an appetite. Once i sat down i was still hesitant with the menu options. The server came around and made suggestions and mentioned was popular, so i decided to try something completely different. I ordered the Truffle Burger and it was absolutely amazing. All of the ingredients on the burger were not average things I'd look for in a burger, but it blew my flavor palette away. The first bite was like a little taste of heaven! And i paired it with the Parmesan Truffle fries and those were amazing too! I was completely blown away. The only thing that would have made it better was a little bit nicer and more attentive service. Other than that i was too focused on my food to care."}
{"text":"Don't mind the long line at the entrance, it is worth it. The room is crowded but the tables are nicely set and the low seats really comfy.   The food is delicious, prices are \"reasonable\" for Vegas and the staff is really efficient and welcoming.   Table of 2. Had the onion rings, the truffle fries, the farm burger and the chanterelle burger, 2 ice teas. 63 dollars before gratuity. No regret.  The batter and fried part are amazingly crusty and yet not greasy. The fries are cut and buttered with garlic and herbs like Michel Guerard used to do it. Burger are big and really tasty. The duck bacon is a tad salty but it's compensated by the egg and the sauce.   The chanterelles were perfectly cooked and, again, proportions were really generous. My wife couldn't finish it. :)  A nice lunch place, definitely."}
{"text":"Great for small groups without a reservation. Food was excellent! Had the truffle fries and gooey fries as an appetizer. Very good. Fish and Chips sandwich for dinner, amazing! Tasted fresh, breading was solid, and in house tarter sauce. Good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"A definite new LOVE! So FLIPPING delicious! I had the Duck Bacon Burger and it was INSANE! Everything has an INCREDIBLE flavour, GREAT service too! YUM!"}
{"text":"Just ok. Certainly not worth the $50 we paid.  I've had way better at Beck's and Prince's."}
{"text":"Great location at PH every time i'm in Vegas i have to go to Gordon Ramsay's BurGR!! burgers are awesome 1st time there i tried the Britannia BurGR - Sharp Cheddar + Mango Chutney + Arugula  with Truffle Parmesan Fries and this weekend i tired the Farm BurGR! Duck Breast Bacon + English Sharp Cheddar + Fried Egg = Delicious!  cant wait till i go back!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure how long Burgr has existed, but I only first got to try it yesterday for the first time.  Very good burger, but I dunno if it's worth the line that was building up when we finished eating.  Service was slow, but according to our server Tuesdays are like that.    My burger was top notch, the sweet potato fries were perfect, and there was a lot of good looking servers.  What's not to like, other than the pricetag?"}
{"text":"Perfect burgers . I will have a burger Everytime I'm in vegas at Gordon Ramsay's....."}
{"text":"Good for the price.  Farm burger: bun very good, meat itself could have used more seasoning, fried egg could've been less cooked. Overall burger a bit dry. Parmesan truffle fries: needed to be cooked more (needs more crisp!) overall taste really good! Especially with the garlic aioli. Best garlic aioli I've tasted!  Hubby got the Hell's Kitchen. Delish and just the right amount of spice!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't mind blown by the food but it was a good experience. I was really glad they use a texting service to inform you once your table is ready for your group. (The line outside the place is only for tables for 2.) My friends and I were able to explore the mall within Planet Hollywood for about 45 minutes while we waited to receive a text back.  I ordered the Chanterelle Burger and felt like I couldn't taste much of the other flavors aside from the meat patty. But the burger comes with a pretty large patty, so I felt like I got my money's worth as it filled me up like crazy! I had a bite of my sister's Farm Burger and enjoyed hers a bit more since I love eggs.  The Truffle Parmesan Fries seemed okay to me. Most flavor came from the sauces served with the fries, which were good. But I didn't think the fries were anything spectacular.  Perhaps I had higher expectations because of all the other reviews. I really wanted to love it but I just was not blown away. At least I can say I tried it! It was an overall good experience though. Just not sure if I want to pay $15 for a burger again."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in Vegas with reasonable prices.   We tried the Farm Burger with duck bacon and the special Hog Burger. Both were cooked to perfection and very juicy and tender. We liked the Farm burger best, nothing beats salty bacon topped with a perfectly cooked over-easy egg.   We also tried the Truffle fries and Sweet Potato fries. Both were great, but we especially enjoyed the Truffle fries. You can easily share 1 fry between 2-3 people depending on your appetite.   For dessert we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding Pops and the were gooey goodness. We can't wait to go back and visit again.   Service was great and you can keep your menu as a souvenir if you choose."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 10 minutes before someone came by to put us down on the waiting list-- which we were told was going to be 45-60 minutes. Luckily we only had to wait 30 before they text me saying to head back and they would take us to our seats.   The chicken wings were awesome. Nice kick and crunch. I really like spicy food but those who can't handle spice may think it's too much. The onion rings were very good. Not greasy or oily at all. I couldn't get over the ketchup curry. It was soooo good. We inhaled the appetizers.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger (cooked medium). They cooked it exactly how I wanted it. This was actually pretty spicy so definitely do not get it if you can't handle spicy foods. They did not skimp on the avocado. Fresh vegetables and the bun was good too. I actually couldn't finish my burger because there was so much and that's pretty rare for me to need a to-go box.   The truffle fries lived up to all of the reviews I read on here- although it seemed like half of my batch might have been over cooked???? There was this wonderful crunch but then I would get some that seemed a little dry. Overall it was to die for regardless if some pieces seemed a tad over cooked.   The staff was amazing. My glass was always completely full. The waiter found out we've never been here before and gave some really great recommendations and let us know that it takes about 25 minutes to get or burgers and suggested getting a couple of appetizers to share. I really want to give this place 4.5/5 stars but it won't let me. We almost left because of the wait but I'm glad we didn't. We arrived at 7:30, seated around 8:45 and there was still a line to get in when we finally left at 10."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was attentive and friendly. Everyone in my party was completely filled with their burgers. I ordered the farm burger which was definitely worth it. The prices are higher but I left more than satisfied with my meal. We ordered the gooey and truffle fries to split at the table, as well as the coffee shake--- YUM. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"After looking forward to eating here I finally got a chance! However, the meal was decent, but a bit over-hyped for me.  We arrived at around 9.30 PM on a Friday night, and for a table of 10, we were seated about 30-45 minutes later. I thought the decor was nice, it was kept to a minimum, but still classy, especially with the cool fire display near the entrance. Service was pretty friendly, helpful, and patient! I split the Farm Burger and a hot dog with my boyfriend.   The Farm burger was served with cheese, strips of bacon and a couple over easy eggs, nothing on the sides. First bite was pretty good, oozy with the egg, and the meat was tender and blended with the bacon. But other than that, I thought after a while the BurGR started to get kind of boring, and turned into \"just another fancy burger\". Don't get me wrong, it was pretty tasty, just not the best I've ever had.  The hot dog had a bit more flavor than the burger. Onions and toppings were well made and blended together, the hot dog itself loaded with spices.   I'm glad I got a taste, but not sure I'll be back a second time unless someone reallyyyy wants me to go with them."}
{"text":"Was really excited for this place based on reviews. Very normal, sad, pedestrian. Cheesecake Factory-esque. What a disappointment. Lesson learned: celebrity chefs are sell outs."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely delicious. I had the Chanterelle burger, and my boyfriend had the Hell's Kitchen burger. We also shared some onion rings, and we each had a Creme Brûlée shake. Everything was absolutely fantastic - easily five stars for the food.  However, we ordered some sweet potato fries that never came. To their credit, the manager came over and was very nice about it. He took them off of the bill, and brought us some (delicious) regular fries for our trouble. Minus one star for the fry debacle.   Also, and the reason for taking off two additional stars, is that I got violently ill about 8 hours later.  I'm not sure which part of the meal made me sick, but I know it was something I had at BurGR."}
{"text":"Had a little taste test between this place and Bobby's Burger Palace across the street...although very close, I enjoyed Bobby's Burger just a tad more. I had the burger with duck bacon and egg and side of fries...it was very, very good. The wait to get in was ridiculous. Giving 4 stars because of wait and because compared to Bobby's Burger, it fell just a little short...but still very good"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Gordon Ramsay Burgr.  Like really really impressed, mainly with the service.  Yes the food is actually pretty good but the service blew me away.  The waiter who served us was absolutely the best server ever.  He didn't even need to write anything down.  How amazing was this guy's memory.  He had many tables he had to worry about too and the fact that he remembers everyone's orders (correctly too) has me extremely amazed.  But back to the food.  I picked up the wings for starters.  I didn't realize that they give you 8 wings.  I was expecting a smaller portion but Ramsay really hooked it up.  They were big wings too and they tasted amazing.  The meat came right off and the flavors were outstanding.  The carrot toppings were ok, not to my liking but the wings were the best quality tasting wings I've ever had.    The farm burger was really good too.  It had some really delicious tasting bacon meat and the egg was made to perfection.  Eggs and burgers are such a great match.  The buns with the sesame seeds was a bit ok but overall my burger was the bomb diggity.  I had my burger meat medium well and yes it was perfectly medium well.  Wow I though to myself this is one fantastic burger.    Overall the wait is pretty long for a big table but for just two people the wait wasn't that bad at all.  We waited for about 15 minutes and could have been seated early but I didn't wanna sit at the bar tables.  The service was outstanding and really made our night.  My chances of return are very likely.  I was getting pretty sick of burgers in general but the fact that I like says a lot.  Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I have not been to this restaurant in a couple years but from what I can remember from it is that is was freaking amazing. The Parmesan Truffle fries were so fresh and delicious. The Russian roulette of jalapeno poppers with their own individual dipping sauces were incredible. The burgers were so good and cooked to perfection which to me is medium rare.I can't wait to come back to this spot next year. I highly recommend you stop by this place if you are in the Las Vegas area and you will not be disappointed at all.  PS: It is very hard to choose a burger because everything looks good!"}
{"text":"The burger did not disappoint. It was seasoned just right and perfectly cooked to order. It was easy to scrape off the cheese since i ordered no cheese. This did not ruin my experience. The truffle fries are amazing with or without the unique dipping sauces. Glad to have something other than ranch. The strawberry shake with vanilla cream brulei pudding and a cookie was a dessert combination like i have never tasted before. It was excellent."}
{"text":"I read some bad reviews about this place, but my wife was insistent in going, so we went.  Price is on the high end for burgers.  By that, I mean to say we spent ~$60 on lunch.  That said, it was worth every penny.  From arriving to receiving our food, it took about 30m, which is to be expected when it's made fresh.  During this time, we took pictures, chatted, and were regularly attended to by our waitress that kept drinks full at all times.  Then the fries arrived (I ordered their gooey fries with cheese and an egg and bacon and I'm not sure what all else was on them), and these were probably the best fries I've eaten in my life.  (I'd love tips on making them at home, because they were so good I actually took the leftovers back to our hotel room, where we debated who got to eat them [I won, but let her have some].)  Before we could finish our fries, our burgers arrived.  I had their Farm Burger, which I was a little skeptical if liking due to some of the ingredients...but it was awesome.  I didn't get to take any of this home... because I ate it all.  The price likely puts this beyond the typical budget (again, I spent more than $50 on lunch)...but when money allows, go for it.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good. The onion rings and jalapeño poppers came to us a bit cold. The burgers were really good. The place is really busy and the noise level was really high. Hard to have a conversation with anyone. Tried many different gourmet burger places in Vegas and Bachi Burger is the best!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place with very good food. Our wait was about 20 minutes but if we arrived 5 minutes later it would have doubled. The burgers were perfect. The fries are great but share an order of them. It is pricey, even for Vegas. Two burgers, one fry, one beer, one water-$56. Consider it entertainment as well as a meal."}
{"text":"I loved Gordon Ramsay BurGR!  Just a little tip before you come here, try to get the Player Rewards card.  This way, all the prices you see in orange will apply to rewards members!! Our group was a party of four and we called ahead just to see how long the wait was.  They told us instead of waiting in line, we can go to the front of the line and put our name down (since there were 4 of us).  I'm guessing people who had to wait in line were groups of 2.  Anyhow, we waited for about 30-45 minutes and got a text when our table was almost ready.    We ordered the sweet potato fries (delicious), onion rings (definitely recommend), Hell's Kitchen burger (asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers & avocado), and Farm burger (sharp cheddar cheese, egg, duck roasted bacon).  Everything was just delicious! Two people can easily share an order of fries or onion rings.    Our waitress was very attentive and came in to check in on us regularly. I would say that I very much enjoyed my experience here at Ramsay's BurGR (hahhhh and I finally got the GR in BurGR -___-)."}
{"text":"The wait was 1hour + but we ended up gambling while waiting so it wasn't a biggie.  The service was great.  The farm burger and the Hog burgers were phenomenal.  Definitely going to my top 5 burgers list.  Their truffle fries were delicious but fries taste good everywhere so nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"who does Gordon call when his joint needs help? This place SUCKS. my 'burgr' was as dry and as salty as the front desk girl- who by the way had her 'fingr' in her mouth while trying to figure out where to seat us...GROSS. just like the food.  So disappointed..."}
{"text":"My group all loved their burgers. My Chantrelle burger was decent. I ordered my burger medium, but it came quite a bit over. Like I said, still decent, but when I mentioned it to our server, she assured me it was medium. Never mind that my friends burger (who also ordered medium) came out very noticeably different from mine.   Onion rings were delicious! (they came recommended, I would not have ordered them otherwise)  All in all, an ok experience."}
{"text":"Yardbird (duck bird) was excellent. Loved the truffle fries. My BF had the hellburger which wasn't that spicy. He liked my burger better"}
{"text":"I don't think it matters which time of day you come, since there always seems to be a wait. We went in as a group of 5 for lunch. Don't get into the long line that you see outside. That is only for parties of 2. For anything larger than that, have your name put down up front. We were informed that the wait would be about 45 minutes long. They were quite accurate with their quoted time! We wandered around the mall during that time since they said they would text us right before our table was ready.  The decor was great and service was attentive enough, though it does take awhile for the food to arrive. I ordered the Farm Burger, and we also ordered their Parmesan Truffle Fries to share. They were both unique, but didn't wow me. I'm glad I tried this place out, but I don't think I'd come back to pay $15 for a burger. However, 4 stars since it was still delicious and portions were huge. My friends and I were ready to pass out from food coma after lunch.  They have their satisfaction survey on an iPod touch. I thought that was a unique way to catch people's attentions when they are paying the bill. Also, if you're a Total Rewards member, there is a $1 discount off everything. This is definitely a place to try, but not a place I'd frequent!"}
{"text":"It took us the entire duration of the meal to realize this, but the \"GR\" in BurGR actually stands for \"Gordon Ramsey\"! Queue the face palm.  Whether or not you are a fan of the first-class chef himself, BurGR is definitely worth checking out. True to its name, this restaurant serves some damn good - you guessed it - burgers! Although the queue could get horrifying during peak hours, your patience will be rewarded with a delighted belly. Prices are pretty reasonable as well. Unfortunately the service was quite slow, so be prepared to wait a while longer even after claiming your table.  // Hell's Kitchen Burger ($15): 4 stars Named after Gordon Ramsey's hit reality show, this burger is a must-try, especially if you enjoy spicy food as much as I do.  // Farm Burger ($15): 4 stars Another solid option. Comes with duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar cheese, and a fried egg. Our waitress told us that this is the most popular item on the menu.  // Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings ($9): 5 stars These onion rings are the best I've ever had! You get a choice of two dipping sauces: chipotle ketchup or cheddar ranch, the latter being the tastier option.  ProTip: Don't forget to take those souvenir menus home with you!"}
{"text":"Torn between 4 and 5 stars. Went on the lower end due to the cost (advertised as $$ on Yelp but when you consider fries aren't included in the burger price, it's teetering on that $30+ $$$ range) and just some poorly executed concepts. Spent $67.95 before tip for 2 shakes, waters, 2 burgers, and an onion ring appetizer. No fries, no desserts, no alcohol. Doesn't take reservations, and the line to get in before their 11 am open was about 20 minutes worth of deep at 10:50.  Onion ring appetizer was large and awesome. Spicy ketchup not too spicy even though I'm very sensitive to that. Cheese on there. Large vertical container good for short tables.  Shakes sound great, but the chocolate one just has a few inches of \"caramel pudding\" on top, it's just a chocolate shake layered... I'd rather get those tastes integrated, and the pudding was weird. Same thing for the oreo shake with creme brulee on top (which was better.)   Went with the Euro burger and added duck breast bacon (it's the 'bacon' of the breast of the duck) because I didn't want the farm burger, the only one that comes with it. Husband enjoyed that one though, and I loved mine, but couldn't finish more than half.  The check holder was super heavy due to it holding a 3rd-ish generation iPod Touch... I thought oh, we can run our check ourselves here, cool... but then I realized it was just for a survey. After having to click through several errors, I could fill out a survey there, but like, no thanks? This doesn't make me as a millennial any more likely to fill out the survey than if on paper, and the containers had to be large and difficult for servers to fit in their aprons. Our server was really, really great, and the assistants were constantly refilling our waters.   Not bad at all, and I've never watched a single thing with Gordon Ramsey in it, but from SNL skits and other cultural things, I gather he'd be screaming if someone else did some of the things his restaurant did."}
{"text":"Got there around 6pm on Thursday.  Line wasn't very long.  Hostess was wonderful.  As you got in line she came by to give you an idea of how long the wait was.  Our waitress, Mia, was absolutely wonderful.  You could tell that she loved her job.  I had the super antioxidant cocktail....yum.  The American burger was flavorful and cooked perfectly.  My husband had the Farm burger which was also cooked perfectly.  We shared the plain fries which were good with the chipotle ketchup.  I'm not a fan of curry so I didn't really like the curry ketchup but that is just personal taste.  Definitely worth the $$."}
{"text":"4 of us went in there for lunch and were completely blown away! These burgers are the best we have ever ate. I had the Brittania Burger and I was in heaven. Others got the Farm Burger...incredible. We also ordered the Parmesan truffle fries and you will not be disappointed!!! So delicious! Can't wait to go back to Vegas and go there again. Gordon Ramsey sure know how to hit your taste buds."}
{"text":"It was really good. Reasonable pricing. I was stuffing my face with their truffle fries. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Food Porn:  Ordered the American burger, shake #1 (chocolate pudding with 6 inches of caramel and a toffee cookie) and the truffle fries.   Shake was a sin, burger was cooked to the right temperature and very high quality meat -- with a Kobe-like texture. Truffle fries could have been done a little longer but generous cheese and truffle oil.   Staff was friendly except for one aloof girl at the front.   Get there 20 minutes before opening for lunch or wait for 20 minutes in line."}
{"text":"Burgers are one of my favorite foods ever. We weren't really planning to come to BurGR but we happened to be near there so we decided to check on how long the wait would be. The wait for a party of 6 would've been 1hr+ but the lady at the counter suggested that we split into 3 tables of 2. That's what we did but the wait was still around 30 minutes. We were actually starving that day because we were walking around the strip after a really really long night. I think it was around 4pm and we haven't eaten anything so we were so hungry.   This burger definitely hit the spot. It was so good and juicy. I got the farm burger and shared fries with my friend. We were a little too hungry so we weren't as hungry in the end, so we couldn't quite finish the fries. But overall, everything was amazing. The service was really good, our server kept coming back to ask us about our meal and it was really appreciated."}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, but I have no other choice. Since when does a burger place have a rope queue? And why are the female workers wearing less clothes than the street walkers out on the corner of The Strip?   Strike 1: Took forever to be greeted by a server.   Strike 2: An additional 15 minutes for waters. Tack on another 10 minutes for beer.   Strike 3: Ordered a burger medium well, it came out medium. Friend ordered their burger medium, it came out medium well. Sigh.   The entire place reeks of truffle oil. Like, to the point of nauseatingly overwhelming. We should have went back to Gordon Ramsay Pub, had a much better experience there!"}
{"text":"I loved my cheeseburger. I eat cheeseburgers often and this was one of the best I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly and the blue cheese was delicious.  The chocolate milkshake was like drinking pudding. I can't wait to go back. The service was efficient."}
{"text":"Good burger. Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger said it should have been spicy and wasn't spicy at all.  Fries are good the yellow sauce on the sweet potato fries are gross.  The best sauce was the curry ketchup! I would recommend this highly on a burger. Seriously worst service. I would go back. Sat there over an hour never got a refill on drinks. Then a server was non existent. When we asked another refill from a different server he looked at us an turned away then finally someone came.  As a chef myself food is a major part of the experience but the service seals the deal. Don't forget the customer service."}
{"text":"how do you ruin a good quality burger?  fail to season the meat properly prior to cooking.  GR, I know you've heard of salt and pepper.  like most other strip restaurants, BurGR suffers from the inexplicable need to play down to the blandest of palates."}
{"text":"Damn I have no clue what our waiter's name was, but he was super nice and helpful, and had been working there for a long time. I love being served by someone who loves their job like that!  I can honestly say I have never had a better burger in my life.   I got the Euro burger. It didn't look fancy like my mom's burger than was cut in half and arranged uniquely on her plate, or my brother's fish and chips sandwich which looked like an odd but upscale fried fish hot dog.  But oh man, the taste was impeccable. I love goat cheese, but the only other burger I've had with it on it wasn't that great. Still, I was willing to try again. I was so glad I did. All the ingredients were perfectly proportioned, unlike a lot of other restaurants. The taste was undeniably on another level. Of course this was only my second time ever going to a restaurant owned by a famous chef.  (My first time was earlier in the trip at Lupo by Wolfgang Puck - also on another level.)  I had it cooked medium, but it looked more medium rare to me - which is fine since I was thinking of ordering it that way anyway. I was very happy. We also got truffle fries. Oh man, so delicious. Lots of cheese and truffle oil and garlic. 2 kinds of dipping sauces, one is a ketchup with brown sugar in it I think, and the other was some kind of flavored mayonnaise. Both were very good.  I usually can only finish half of my dishes at restaurants, but I didn't wanna waste this meal. I ate it for breakfast the next day and was very satisfied.  I'm definitely coming back in June to have my boyfriend try this place. It's way too good to not share with another carnivore."}
{"text":"New menu as of this week.  Awesome lunch. Hardly waited in line. It's too bad they don't offer reservations via open table.  We had the wings. Crispy n slightly spicy drummets. It was a great start.  Over 50 draft beers.  Burgers: We had Hell's Kitchen, lobster and shrimp and the farmer. The lobster and shrimp burger had big chunks of shrimp and shredded lobster meat. It was a little salty but that's what beer is for right.  Hells burger was awesome. So much beef flavor. Plus it was cooked perfectly as the juice from the patty was ozzing out. The color was evenly light pink and no burn marks. It was a masterpiece. Who ever cooked the lunch meal on 3/31/17 today at 3:30, u rock!!!! We also ordered the onion rings. It was light n crispy like tempura batter. The fries are thick. Great sauces that comes with these sides.  Loved my burgers!"}
{"text":"Had the best frickin burger in a long time!    So good that we came back the next night, hah.    First visit, I had the Farmburger which had duck breast bacon & a fried egg along with a delicious sauce.  Omg, a must try!!  Their sweet potato fries with vanilla powdered sugar = amazing!    A plus for this lunch-time visit...  Hell's Kitchen winner, Christina Wilson, was in the spot!!  (www.facebook.com/chefchristinawilson).  She was super sweet, introduced herself, shook my hand, and allowed me to snap a quick pic (I was trying to hurry & not be a bother, so my pic was blurry, hah, my luck!)    Dinner the next night wasn't as great (maybe because the boss wasn't there, people were slacking, lol), nah, but probably just a taste preference thing.  I did have to send mine back tho; my meat was still alive!!  We shared two so we could taste more of Ramsay's creations... Chanterelle burger & Damnation burger.  Both were good, meat cooked to perfection, but not as good as the Farmburger.  Sweet potato fries were amazing again!   Def coming back for more."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The service was excellent. I left full and in a great mood. Everybody there works together to create a great environment to sit down, eat, and enjoy your dinner. Ask for my boy jared, one of the best waiters I've dealt with in vegas! 5 stars hands down. Should be on everyones To-Do list in vegas! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"As we all know if you're a regular visitor to Vegas lots of the restaurants are pricy.  While I don't mind spending money on a good meal, I simply can't do it every night.  Enter Gordon Ramsay's BurGR restaurant - a good meal at a reasonable price.  Bravo Gordon!!  Gordon Ramsay is quite the popular gent these days and everyone wants to taste his food.  I guess a little part of me was interested too, but I was more interested in saving a few bucks.  The night before, the lines at 7:30pm were rather long and I expected the same for our meal, but we were pleasantly surprised that when we arrived at 6:30pm there was no line!  We were seated right away and the waitress was super attentive.  They offer an iPad for you to view all the beers, appetizers, burgers.  It's good in a way, but more and more restaurants are offering an iPad as a way for customers to order their food and I'm not liking it.  It seems very impersonal.  We ordered the Roasted Jalapeño Poppers as an appetizer and damn those buggers were hot! Loved the presentation: deep fried and standing in a shot glass filled with the dipping sauce.  So good.   Next we ordered our burgers, my friends ordered the Uber Cheese Burger and loved it.  It was huge and they opted to share.  Feeling a bit hungry, I decided on the Southern Yardbird Burger which is basically a chicken burger.  It was different, but in a good way.  It wasn't lacking flavor in the least bit and I loved the little zing of the pickles.  A nice touch to the burger.  Upon leaving at 7:30pm we say the HUGE line! People seem to eat later in Vegas so keep that in mind when planning your dinner activities.  Definitely a place to stop and eat at, especially if you're looking for a good meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I have eaten here on several occasions, once as a carnivore and once as a vegetarian (I am apparently a fan of weird, sporadic diets).  For vegetarians, the Earth Burger did not disappoint. Once I finished the burger, I did not have a craving for meat, which is always a plus.  For the rest of us, you cannot go wrong with the Farm Burger during your visit. Sure, the burger is very hyped up on Yelp, but it is still very tasty if you like eggs on your burgers.  If you choose to order fries, the parmesan truffle fries are by far the best. I think I liked them more than the burgers.  Surprisingly, the desserts are very tasty too, especially the push pops. I highly recommend them, and the shakes did not disappoint either.  Beware: a burger and fries will cost you about $30 (without a drink). This place is delicious, but you have to ask yourself if it is $30 delicious or not. I prefer Bachi Burger to this restaurant, but it is still a very good burger option on The Strip."}
{"text":"They do not serve ketchup on burgers but you don't need it. This was the first burger in my life without ketchup. No need because the burger melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Two delicious burgers, truffle parmesan fries, friendly service, nice atmosphere, two very happy diners. It was a great start to our vacation.   (Get the Euro burger!)"}
{"text":"The Hell's Kitchen burger is beyond the best. We tried that one, the farm burger and the uber cheese. The Hell's Kitchen burger was super flavorful. I had only one bite and I wanted to steal the burger from my mother. The farm burger was decent. The duck fat made it moist. However, I am a saucy person so I had to use some of the sauces from the onion rings we ordered.  I definitely recommend getting the gooey fries. They are beyond delicious. Just don't fill yourself up on that before your food comes!  The beer battered onion rings are super crispy. Usually anything beer battered is a lot more heavy and dense but I love how the batter wasn't thick. The ketchup mix was delicious.  We also had the sweet potato fries. It was sweet. The honey mayo was interesting but still delicious. I applaud them for making such good sauces.  The only disappointing part is that you can see all of the kegs but there is no specialty beer. All the beer on tap is just like the typical bottled beer everyone serves.  I already want it again after I just had it the other day."}
{"text":"Never have I had a meal at a burger joint that was so well thought out, presented, executed and reasonably priced. The food was so above expectations that the dishes I had rivaled those of established and well known burger joints.   The dishes were simple and comforting, well known and commonplace among the typical foods one finds at a burger joint but each had a twist and an added element that intrigued me.   I didn't actually have a burger (it was a hot dog) but nevertheless every component of that meal was memorable. The quality of the meat and snap to the \"dawg\" delighted one texture. The creaminess of the avocado added another. The toppings were fresh. The fluffy on the inside and lightly crispy on the outside bun enveloped all that goodness.  The jalapeno poppers were crunchy on the outside and the cheese was gooey on the inside. It was lightly spicy and the cheesy dipping sauce they were on top of was also a little spicy.   The truffle fries were also well made and I crave them often. Nicely sized, fluffy on the inside and salty from the Parmesan. The hint of truffle oil came through nicely as well.   For a weekday and party of two, we didn't wait long. The prices were fair and the food is one of the best you can find on the Strip for the prices especially because it's so well made and tasty."}
{"text":"My first day in Vegas I visited Gordon Ramsay's Burger Gill for a dinner.  The casino itself is at Planet Hollywood which is quite the disappointment but sort of makes sense; seeing how ironic the Michelin Star owner is actually selling burgers it makes sense to make it at a trashy hotel.  The restaurant itself has a quite modern vibe, they have a huge fire pit in an infinity shape outside.  The lines are long and I have no idea why.  When we were seated, we noticed half of the restaurant was empty; so maybe they make people wait just for a show.  THE STAFF -  The waiters were really accommodating and knew which line to read, they aren't very personable but they are quite fast when it counts.     THE FOOD -  For starters (or \"snacks\" on their menu), we ordered their 'Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings' which in my opinion over seasoned and lacked originality.  The parmesan cheese that was skinned on top of the onions gave me mixed views on if they were to be salty, sour, or sweet; It was just a mess!  I ordered their 'Chanterelle Burger' which did not taste very good with their caramelized mushrooms and figgy-onion jam.  I didn't get it.  Come on Gordon, that's embarrassing!  My friend ordered their 'American Burger' which was absolutely astounding and the way it was presented was pleasing to the eyes and also the taste buds!  (To recap, we ordered the following) :  - Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings (Parmigiano-Reggiano and chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip) $9  - Chanterelle Burger (Chanterelle mushrooms with arugula and figgy-onion jam) $16  - American Burger (American cheese with butter lettuce mixed with tomatoes, pickles, and onions.   *** Their drinks were very hardcore, but that's just me; I can never drink hard liquor even if it has a fruity sensation to it***"}
{"text":"Incredible. I don't think it was expensive at all...compare this to Friday's or Rubys but you're getting this awesome burger that tastes incredible. I also had the jalapeño poppers. Amazing!! Delightful presentation!! Maybe the milkshakes could be $1-2 cheaper but I have no regrets on that purchase or the calories!!"}
{"text":"Easily one of the top burgers I have had anywhere in the US. It was so good I went twice in two days. The jalapeño poppers were not just artistic, but the best I've ever tried. The burger was juicy and packed with flavor, just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate. The frozen ice cream pops were also to die for. This has become my favorite place to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ignore all the Nay-sayers and try this place. Worth the wait. We had Hell's and Euro burgers with truffle fries.  Wow! Coming from a spoiled New Yorker."}
{"text":"Excellent Parmesan fries. Great presentation. Excellent setting, but.... Burger meat was very average. My husband tried the veggie burger. If he didn't add toppings at extra cost, it would have been tasteless. A decent place, but nothing fantastic considering how many excellent places there are in Vegas. Average meal without booze is about $25. Be prepared to wait an hour at least. Feel no need to return."}
{"text":"I ate burgers in many places and probably the one at BurGr is no the base I've ever tasted... but the choice of unconventional burger recipes is so great that one definitely needs to try this place at least once. Warning: if you're trying the one with the fried inside be careful... it tends to explode (on your face, on your brand new shirt and on your pants). The waitress didn't seem really surprised by the mess so it probably happens quite often... a warning to handle it carefully would have been welcomed (or maybe it was just me being particularly clumsy that night)."}
{"text":"My burger was very good. The fries were ok, but we did love the onion rings! I love the decor and who doesn't love its location? Planet Hollywood is one of my favorite spots to hang out around the strip!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We sat at the kitchen seats, and could watch the kitchen in action. It was awesome. Delicious food, nice cocktails."}
{"text":"Oh Gordon Ramsay! How I love thee! It's my first time in Vegas and I planned my trip here long we arrived. This place is much smaller than I expected. Our server was very helpful and answered all of our questions and we had a lot! My boyfriend and I are used to regular ground beef burgers with lettuce, ketchup and pickles...not ground brisket, aoli and duck bacon. This was hands down the best burger I have ever had in my life! I would go to Vegas JUST for this.   I know Christina from Hells Kitchen was the chef here and I was hoping to at least lay eyes on her, but our server told us she was promoted to manager/executive chef of ALL his Vegas restaurants! YOU GO GIRL! So proud!"}
{"text":"ONION RINGS ARE A MUST TO TRY !!  It's really a great place and prices are not high as I thought it"}
{"text":"I met two friends for dinner.  I have been wanting to try Ramsay's BurGR for some time but never got around to it.  I ordered the chanterelle burger, rare, and an order of truffle parmesan fries.  The two friends got different burgers and another order of the same fries and we shared both orders of fries.  Service was good.  There was a wait for our burgers, but it was quite alright as it gave us time to catch up.  We hadn't seen each other in about 10 years.  A lot of water under the bridge.  The food arrived and it was cooked the way I like it, juicy, red, and very tasty.  The brioche bun was perfect for the burger.  The truffle parmesan fries are a wonderful accompaniment.  I also got an iced tea and it was refilled a couple of times without me having to ask.  We skipped dessert because we had a good amount of food between the burger and the fries.  I'm definitely a fan of Ramsay's burger joint."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place and the food execution and service is excellent.  The burgers look small, but the meat is so rich that you're easily filled by half of the burger.  So, be careful ordering and sharing is an option.  If you come with 4 people, consider splitting up the burgers and share.  I liked the jalapeno poppers the best and came in a shot glass.  Ordered ice tea and got refills without even asking, great service."}
{"text":"Me and my fiance had to stop by and visit one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. So we tried the BurgR. The only thing that didn't get that last star was the wait. They had people with 2 or more get on a wait list and didn't have to wait in line. But once we got inside, this was a nice place. The food was good, so many decisions with the burgers. The top burger is the Hells Kitchen burger and the bottom one is the American burger. The fries, the truffle parmesan fries were delicioso and came with homemade ketchup and some kind of garlic aioli. I would recommend this place if the wait is overlooked."}
{"text":"Hard to imagine a better burger in Las Vegas.  The place had an insane wait; we got there at 5pm and still waited for about 30 minutes for a table.  All the burgers were excellent --- the truffle fries and sweet potato fries were delicious.  Servers provided iPads to view the drink menus; nice touch.  This place accepts Total Rewards points too, which is a plus.  For a group of six that each got a burger, shared three orders of fries, and maybe one drink each, price was about 27 each.  Not bad."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, on my recent 4 day visit to Vegas I ended up eating there twice. Burgers were cooked exactly how I wanted! Everything was delicious! Prob one of my fav burger places of all times. i will def be coming back next time Im in town. Their shake menu is pretty awesome as well. I had a mocha/chocolate  shake! Its a must! The service was very kind and professional. I highly recommend this place. Also, it's kid friendly (no menu, but place is full of kids)."}
{"text":"I am a burger fanatic.  These burgers were cooked just right.  I always order medium rare, and always get medium.  Not here, it was almost rare which is the way I like it!  I ordered the one with arugula and goat cheese.  IT was hard to decide but the one I got was amazing.  I wish I could remember the name.  Any of these burgers would be a good choice.  The french fries and dipping sauce were also amazing!  I was too hungover to try any of the drinks, but can't wait to go back again to try it all!"}
{"text":"Great experience and service.  Had the Hell's Burger medium rare, probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Must have the Truffle Parmesan fries and try the Veev liquor lemon acai cocktail"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was amazing. The service was friendly and fast. love their beer selection. We started with the Hummus and the stuffed Jalapenos. The Hummus was pretty good but those Jalapenos were one of the best things I have ever eaten. I ordered the fish sandwich which was excellent except it had too much bread for my taste. My wife loved the Hells kitchen burger (she ordered it vegetarian with a portabello mushroom instead of meat). It's a little expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"HOLY GEEBUS WHERE do I begin?!!!!! Well for one, the ambiance was off the chart insane... Fire lighting the entrance was cool. Of course I'm trying to stand in line while everyone wants a photo with the sign haha. So the burgers were to die for delicious. Juicy and the bread was on point. Although the fries weren't included, you best believe I ordered. I tried both the truffle Parmesan  with aoli and then plain. I loved the parmesan and Fell in love.....If you get a chance to try the jalapeño poppers, please do because you'll regret it if you don't.   Other wise, this place has a special place in my heart"}
{"text":"It's OK.  Burger: 4 stars. I had the Hells kitchen burger, which I enjoyed, but it wasn't anything I haven't had before.  Sweet Potato Fries: 2 stars Sweet as in they put vanilla powder on the fries and you dip them in honey/mayo. I like my sweet potato fries to be zingy and not taste like candy.  Shake #1: 5 stars Chocolate milk shake topped with butterscotch pudding and a cookie with fresh whip cream! I didn't even try the cookie because there was too much food, but the shake/pudding was delicious!  This is an affordable Ramsey restaurant and the food is good, but not memorable....except the dessert milk shakes!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Burgr! Favorite burgers  in Vegas so far to be honest... Burgers were prepared perfectly, appetizers were great, friendly beer list, attentive and professional staff, wonderful milkshake for dessert. We are staying at Planet Hollywood for the weekend so didn't have to travel far for the trip. Only a short wait in line even though the restaurant was packed and I have to say I'm a big fan of the queue system they use for tables 3 and under. We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. The decor was nice, the food looked perfect, the staff went above and beyond.  Hell, Master Chef Gordon Ramsay owns it, it must be amazing! NOT!  The food was just \"OK\". Especially for the price: 4 diners, 4 burgers 2 fries, 2 onion rings, a shake, a beer, iced tea and a pepsi came out to $150+.  You can do better in this location for the food and the price."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS! I went to Burgr recently on a trip with a few friends, and I was so excited to go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. We were a little nervous when we saw the wait- at 7PM on a Wednesday, the line was about 40 people deep outside of the restaurant. However, our group of three only had to wait 15 minutes or so for a table- which is impressive because once we were seated, I didn't feel rushed at all.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, and split a side of regular fries with my friends (one fry was plenty for all of us). The burger was exactly what I would expect from a celebrity chef- it was juicy, perfectly cooked, and the toppings were incredible (avocado, roasted tomato, roasted jalapeño, and a jalapeño aioli). I would definitely recommend this- and it isn't too spicy at all!  Also- I have to add that the service was very good given an odd situation we had in our group.. One of my friends is a vegetarian, and the only vegetarian option was a portobello 'burger.' Well, turns out she hates mushrooms... And she basically asked the server to give her the Hell's Kitchen burger 'vegetarian style.' I cringed when she asked for that- like, who goes to a restaurant named 'Burgr' and asks for that!!!! But the server was SO polite about it, and brought out a burger that basically had a ton of veggies on it in place of a burger. Her attitude was so impressive to me. That is what makes a restaurant great!  The prices were pretty good for the quality of food- I didn't mind paying what I did for my food at all. I didn't give a full 5 stars because the food took forever to come out, and the hostesses were not that friendly at all!"}
{"text":"The only reason there is one star is because I can't give less - that and the Manager, Benji.  Started out with a 45 minute wait when there were open tables. Seated, waited 20 minutes before the server arrived to take our order. Watched another server scratching her hair / head. She did NOT go and wash her hands. Ordered. Thirty minutes later still waiting for food. Thus far, I am unimpressed.  (Had dinner the other night at Chef Ramsay's Pub at Caesar's Palace. The food was extremely good and the service was friendly, efficient and very well executed).  Food finally arrived after complaining to the useless waitress.  The server that had been scratching her head brought the food.  My burger was overcooked and luke warm.  My husband's burger was cold and overcooked.  The only reason the fries were hot on the top was because they'd been under the heat lamp for heaven knows how long!  We asked for ketchup - never showed up.  We spoke with the Manger Benji - very nice man - who freely admitted that the daytime service at BurGR is awful.  He invited us to return the next time we're in Vegas which we will do but certainly not with the same anticipation.    Looking around there were more tables waiting for their food than tables eating.  There are orders stacked up under the lamps waiting. I haven't seen our server even bring out one order yet.  After such hoopla and anticipation over BurGR I am so dissapointed.  The food was horrible - certainly not worth the price tag or the hullabaloo.  I really like Chef Ramsey's other restaurants - I just hope that he finds out what a travesty BurGR is truly.  It is EVERYTHING that he preaches against:  awful service, awful food and, as far as the wait staff goes, a complete lack of regard for the patron.  I actually saw one of the patrons tip the busboy because he was more helpful than the server."}
{"text":"I've been watching Ramsey on the food network for years so I was super excited to try his food. Unfortunately I wasn't to impressed :(  I got the traditional burger and added bacon it was good but it was so mediocre nothing about it stood out.  We got the truffle fries, they were also good but they were $11 that's crazy! It was a couple bucks cheaper then my burger!  Anyway, I probably won't be coming back sadly"}
{"text":"What are you?  This place has brought my attention due Gordon Ramsay one of favorite chefs of all time. This place is so worth it because of the texture of each burger and fries. I went here with my boyfriend, cousin, and her significant other.  Our waiter Elias took care of us and made sure we were extremely satisfied with our food. The patty were so juicy since we all ordered medium well, but we did get different burgers. All I remember was ordering the hells kitchen burger. Damn so juicy and so delicious. My boyfriend ordered the new burger thats not on the menu, cousin ordered the american burger, and her significant other ordered the farm burger. All was amazing. There french fries were the best I've ever tasted. We had regular fries, sweet potato fries, and the fries that come with the parmesan. Omg so worth coming here."}
{"text":"Good burgers but even greater fries and sauces. I didn't like the chicken burger but farm burger and the hog burger (?? The signature one) were both good.   Love the sauces with the sweet potato fries and truffle Parmesan fries! Will be coming back for these!!   The sticky toffee pudding pops weren't as good as they're hyped up to be. Too milky for me.   Attentive service!"}
{"text":"Yum. The first time we tried to go here there was like an hour wait. No thanks. But the second time was around 11a or 12p and we got in no problem. The waitress outfits were a lil Star Trek hooch, but the guys got to wear cute GR jeans and some shirts. Shade. But our waiter was a cutie. Anyway, I got the American burger and split some Parmesan truffle fries with my friend. The sauce was interesting and the fries were good. The ketchup was definitely housemade and it was ok, but there was some stronger flavor in it like horseradish or something that I wasn't all that fond of. But my burger was perfectly done (med well), seasoned perfectly and had a nice little char on it. It was pretty big so a couple of us couldn't finish the burger in one sitting. It made for a great room temp late night drunken munchie snack though (we didn't have fridges in our room at PH, so if you get food poisoning from lack of refrigeration don't blame me). Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy the food. Love my Gordon."}
{"text":"Great burgers. I've tried 4 different burgers here, my favorite is the farm burger.  All burgers taste of quality and not like your run-of-the-mill burger joint.  Parmesan garlic fries were good, but pretty typical in taste.  One thing I could pass on is the jalapeno poppers... it tasted like something you could get at an American chain restaurant.  However, you come here for the burgers, and the burgers are good."}
{"text":"After standing in line to try this restaurant owned by the very own Hell's Kitchen Gordon Ramsay, I have to say it did not disappoint. The duck wrapped in the bao was so tasty! I ordered the Special Hog Burger as an recommendation from my waitress. The burger came out just right! It was juicy and delicious! I love the dramatics of the fire inside the glass windows. We sat right by the fire but yet it wasn't even hot. The only bad thing about sitting by the fire are the diners that want a picture by the fire so you constantly have people going up taking pictures while your eating. Other than that I would highly recommend trying out this restaurant. Before you go, you must try their amazing push pop dessert. One of my favorite desserts!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my lunch at Gordon Ramsays BurGR. I have been a big fan of Ramsay for quite some time now, through his TV / youtube shows. So it was on my things to do list in Las Vegas. I have to say I was not in the least disappointed. Highly recommend the hells kitchen burger and the sweet potato fries. Both came out great and was nice and juicy. Nice touch with the powdered sugar on the sweet potato fries. One of the best we have had.  If you're a fan of chicken wings, id also try the wings here. Nicely fried but not too hard and crispy. Also the pieces were really good ones. You'll be a happy camper.  Both me and my wife felt that the atmosphere in this place was great and the servers very friendly and knowledgeable. Felt good dining here."}
{"text":"I'm a big Gordon Ramsay fan but BurGR fails to meet the high standards we've all grown so accustomed to seeing from him.  We stopped by for a late lunch and were given a 30 minute wait for our table. Fair enough, however an hour later we still hadn't been seated and the front desk looked like a slow moving train wreck. There were about 4 different hostesses juggling 10-20 different groups of people and none of them seemed to be communicating with one another. When the manager stepped in we spoke to them and were promptly seated.  Highlights: The quality of ingredients and presentation were very good. All of the food looked great. The burgers and fries were decently tasty but overall not worth the jumped up prices.  Lowlights: Subpar service was the biggest disappointment. Our server was attentive at first but disappeared once our food was ordered. Each burger is made to order and you can specify the cooking temperature. All 4 of us ordered the same burger 'The American' but had different cooking preferences. They arrived with no markings as to which ones were cooked a certain way and we had to cut all of them in half to determine who's was who's. Ultimately it didn't matter as all of them were cooked well done. The only ketchup BurGR serves is made in house and is laced with a chipotle seasoning. If that isn't your thing, you won't be using any ketchup for your burger or fries.  Try BurGR if you're a Ramsay fan or there's absolutely no wait. However the basic fare doesn't warrant the high prices."}
{"text":"AMAZING burgers!!! Egg on the burger cooked perfectly and the truffle fries are to die for"}
{"text":"So I was not expecting much from this place. I was expecting a gimmicky burger place so I split a burger with a friend. I got the uber cheesy burger (4 different cheeses, added spinach, burger was ordered at medium). It was a little undercooked for medium but we ate it anyway. There aren't any sauces or spread on the burger so I didn't think it would have much flavor but boy was I wrong. I hate to say it but the burger was really good and very tasty. Damn you, Gordon Ramsay! I was hoping it would suck.. it didn't. I would totally go back (sigh).   Pros: Great burgers, flavorful and tasty Cons: Long wait (to get in and about 25 minutes for each burger to be cooked to order), pricey burgers (some are worth it), and expensive fries."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas so of course I had to check out Ramseys burger joint. When we got there we waited roughly 20 minutes to be seated which isn't bad at all. I had the farm burger, parmesan truffle fries, and a vanilla shake. The egg was cooked perfectly with a nice and runny yolk in the center. The burger was also cooked medium as requested. The burger was awesome!! Fries were tasty but not spectacular and the shake was your standard shake. Given we were in vegas I felt like the price wasn't bad. I live in NY so it wasn't more expensive than some of the places here."}
{"text":"Great burger in a shitty Casino plagued by Britney Spears.  In 20 years we'll be speaking an idiotic language.  Hence, the hip misspelling:  Burgr Good luck world."}
{"text":"Fries were not good. Burger was charred on the outside, dry inside. Good apps: wings and onion rings. Great service."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had. Tried 2 different burgers with truffle fries. So good! The first burger wasn't a menu burger. The second one was the Euro Burger. Next time in Vegas I will be trying different ones"}
{"text":"We ordered onion rings and a euro burger.  The onion rings came out quick and were great.  BUT THEN we waited over a half hour for the burger.  We ordered it medium well and it was still bloody!  We told the waiter to take it back and remove it from the bill.  The female manager came by and acted as if they were doing us a favor by not charging us for the food that they did not prepare as ordered! Any quality restaurant either comps something additional (like our onion rings or iced tea) or at least offers to replace the food for free.  This place did neither -- they suggested that we wait an additional half hour for them to remake the burger whereupon they will charge us for it!  This was the first and last time we will be going to this place."}
{"text":"Ate here on the 4th of July one year and it was delicious! We started with an appetizer of the roasted jalapeño poppers, they each came with their own sauce! For my meal I choose the Hell's Kitchen burger. Everything was very fresh! Taste and presentation were completely on point this whole meal. Very friendly staff! Will return next time I hit up the strip!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. I had the Euro burger, hubby had the Blue bgr. Both were awesome. Make sure to try the Parmesan fries, best ever fries I have tried."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I really wanted to know if this place lived up to the hype. We all know Gordon and how he acts on his show, so you'd think this place would be just flat out amazing.  My order: Damnation chicken burger Truffle Parmesan Fries Corona  Presentation of the food looks great. I think more went into that than the taste. Nothing about this Chicken BurGR stood out except it was over grilled. I was not impressed by this at all.  The fries were nothing special either. They seemed to be normal steak fries with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on them. The truffles were in one of the dipping sauces. Again just didn't live up to the hype.   The Corona was probably the only thing that came out meeting my expectation. I placed the order on the iPad that was given to me and it didn't even get sent to the bar. The waiter came over and just took it and read it. My thoughts are it works if you want customized cocktails, but not for beers. I thought for sure it would be like STACKED (customized burger place in Los Angeles).   Overall not that wowed by this place and it was a bit over priced. Aside from watching a game on the screens, and grabbing a drink or two, I would skip this place and probably any other GR place."}
{"text":"The truffle fries were awesome. My burger was delicious. It's a definite to share fries with another person. The burger will fill you up pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service! This is one of the worst places I have ever been. The hostesses were so rude and even the manager walked around with like an arrogant, unhelpful jerk. The waiters were great, but otherwise everything else was awful. The food was just alright, nothing to write home about and definitely not worth the price. I will never return and neither will the entire group I was with."}
{"text":"So sad that we had to wait 25 minutes for one of the worst burgers I've had this year.    Bread was rough, dry and just sucked.  Burger was overdone but didn't matter because it was under seasoned and totally not juicy.  I would of taken any fast food joint's burger over this.  Wings tasted boiled, over boiled.  I'm Chinese, cha siu pork baos, yeah nice try.  The server said they buy the baos from a Korean place?  Uh...its a Chinese dish.  The manager took off the appetizers on the bill.  When asked about my burger, he took that off too.  I was like jeeze, I don't need a free lunch.  Just make it good.   Being from San Francisco, we may be a bit snobby but seriously, we know good food, all kinds of food, especially burgers.    5 stars for Garrett our server.  Sorry his great customer service couldn't make the burger taste any better, so 1 star overall.  Many pretty good looking servers including Garrett."}
{"text":"We are staying near BurGR and dropped in for a quick hot dog.  FABULOUS!!!  Probably the BEST ever!!!  Onion rings are really good too.  Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is a total joke! i wish i could rate it 0 stars but yelp doesn't have that option yet. i always passed by this place when in vegas and it was on my bucket list to try. unfortunately i have to say worst 2hours of my life i have spent at a restaurant and its line.  Now lets talk about their so called delicious burgers and their full of attitude waiters.  I read in the reviews that their fries was good! too bad i never got to try it cause the waiter forgot to put it down and when we mentioned about it he said he will check. when he came back we were almost done with our food and no more space for the fries that was never brought to us anyways. My burger was a totalll mess!! i told the waiter that my order is a little complicated and since he was memorizing everything i told him to write mine down. he brought me a burger with cheese and meat with two tomatoes inside!!! LOL $15 for that. so i told him wheres the sauce? the avacado? the grilled jalepeno? these were originally in the burger only i asked him to put it on the side. i mean everyone makes mistakes its ok. but to not apologize for it and give attitude that's another level. too bad i didn't get the waiters name but he was buff and short and full of himself.  And one more thing , everything takes forever to be brought like if u ask for a ketchup or ranch dressing they will bring it when your food is finished.  So dear gordon ramsey burger and staff thankyou for ruining a family dinner on our trip."}
{"text":"We came here around 8 pm. There was already a line  but we had the option of taking two of the bar seats in front of the kitchen. We opted for that and had a good night. It was interesting to see the behind the scenes kitchen mayhem. The manager sure knows what he's doing- he has the cooks and waiters very organized. This restaurant not only has fabulous servers (many who are very attractive) and a fantastic burger menu, but it also values customer service. Our waitress, Kelsey, was super nice. The Britannia burger was to die for. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"All the hype ! Every time we tried to go there was a huge line! So we decided to go after watching a show so around 12 midnight and the food was NOT THAT GREAT! The setting was nice , presentation was nice , I'm a SWEET POTATOE FRY junkie and their fries seemed like they were sitting their all night ! We ate at TOM's URBAN before for earlier dinner which had A WAY BETTER BURGER for same price !  I wouldn't go again , too long of a wait , unless you go at late weird hour when fries are not fresh ."}
{"text":"While we were fortunate to get a table within 5 minutes, and our waitress was very friendly, what a disappointment this visit turned out to be.   $16 for a tough overcooked burger (that tasted like it started out frozen) isn't something I yearn for. And while the fig-oniony sauce sounded fab, there was so little of it on the burger that only one bite showcased the flavor so what's the point? Lastly on the burger, the bun was hard and stale, seems to me a burger joint should be able to do better than this.   Best part of the meal was the onion rings, with nice and crispy batter and the cheesy ranch was an interesting dip.   We finished off lunch with the sticky toffee pops and those were icky. The ice cream was crystally like it'd been frozen a very long time, and the cake portion was cloyingly sweet.  After today's meal, the conclusion is I won't need to return."}
{"text":"First Gordon Ramsay restaurant I've been too :D  Can't miss this place with all the flames and the huge line of people waiting to try burGR! I got pretty lucky coming here on a Saturday morning at 11 am. There wasn't a line so your best chance is to go early. My boyfriend and I were seated at the counter right in front of the kitchen so we were able to watch all the food being prepared. I thought it was fascinating watching all the burgers come out fresh from the kitchen making their way to the tables, I'm a visual person so looking at all the different burgers helped me determine which one I wanted.  I got the Farm Burger because it has duck bacon and the fried egg made it an easy choice for me. I did enjoy the burger. One thing I noticed, you could taste the cheese, it didn't fade into the background. I really liked that because I love cheese! I thought the duck bacon was rich in flavor but as good as it was, I think the burger would've been better with a regular bacon because it would still provide that savory saltiness but with an added crunch that I thought the burger was missing. The egg was perfectly fried, one bite and the yolk was running. There was a lot of rich components to this burger, the duck bacon, the egg, and the sharp cheddar..it left me wanting something acidic or citrusy to balance all the richness. I also got fries and that was pretty good. Their fries are a thicker cut so it was pretty dense in potato and it was larger in size. I really liked the chipotle and curry ketchup that came as dipping sauce! I also got the Shake #5 and that was SO GOOD. It was a coffee shake with hazelnut pudding and everything about that shake was decadent. Be careful not too drink all the shake because then you're left just pudding and you can't really drink that, and ask for a spoon so you can eat the pudding!   I thought their service was wonderful, our server was friendly and attentive. The quality of the food here was superb. Overall I enjoyed my experience here and I wouldn't mind coming back again."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed but the experience at BurGR. The line to get in was long and slow moving. Once in the appetizer arrived in a timely fashion and the servers were friendly. Although the entree seemed to take a long time ever though the server mentioned it would be right out. Still it was a while later before it arrived. The burger was not exceptional but rather ordinary in flavor."}
{"text":"Yummy. Gourmet burgers. Good variety great price and cool ambiance.  There will probably be a line to get I. When you go so plan on a wait. Good is worth it and the shakes are awesome. Party pudding part shake. Service is good but shared so if you want something don't wait for your waiter or it could be a while. Just ask any one walking by."}
{"text":"I loved it. The Burgr was delicious, people say expensive, but in PH there is Ketchup or something and the prices are almost the same for regular burgers.   I love that the Burgr comes out exactly as identified on the menu, I cannot express how annoying it is to order something and then find that it has half a dozen other items added that are not listed.   Our waiter was great and service was top notch. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Burgers are my thanng!! So I had to try this burger spot. I ordered the Damnation Burger and my friend got the Farm Burger. We shared the truffle fries and jalapeño poppers.. We couldn't resist.. 2 girls with big stomachs- NO problem.  First, the burgers were just OK. Nothing spectacular- a slice of meat in between 2 sesame buns. My chicken burger tasted very organic-Y, the burger meat tasted like there were mixed in veges, which is a plus. The appetizers were delish, the truffle fries came with 2 dipping sauces- an aioli and a Bloody Mary-tasting kind of ketchup. Plus plus! The jalapeño poppers were deep fried with a type of bacon, cheese filling. Plus plus plus!  However, who would have thunk that the poppers were only about 3$ less than the price of my burger?! Huh!?  Overall, good food.. But I think this is just a hyped up burger joint."}
{"text":"Freakin amazing burger that you NEED to try!!  I really like how they text you when your table is ready so you can roam nearby and play the slots while waiting!  3pm on a Saturday was a 20 minute wait! Our server, Alex, was funny and friendly. Every burger we ordered (3 different kinds) were his first, second, and third favorite.. coincidence?! Anyways, he was very open to answering any questions we had about anything. He came by often to make sure we had everything we needed!   I ordered the Blue Burger (maytag blue cheese + arugula) and added onions. I love blue cheese! Medium well cooked perfect with blue cheese that wasn't overwhelming. I didn't make a huge mess like I usually do while eating burgers cuz there wasn't much inside, yet there was sooo much flavor!   Fries weren't anything special in my opinion, but the sauces made them extraordinary!! Homemade ketchup and aioli were bomb.. I added both to my burger and it was a flavor explosion in my mouth!!!  My party of 4 shared an order of regular fries and Parmesan fries. We had more than enough fries! Splitting those plus a burger really fills you up!  $13 for my Blue Burger and fries were $7.. Not the cheapest burger joint but well worth it if you wanna splurge!   The Planet Hollywood website says that the attire is business casual, but it's really not.   Your check is brought out with an iPod built into the check holder to do a survey about your experience!   We thought about accidentally leaving with the cool burGR pen that writes smoothly which we used to sign the bill, but we didn't and asked Alex for one! He gave us 4! =D  I got major props for finding out about this place after everyone took their first bite and let out a moan! =]"}
{"text":"I expect nothing less than perfect from Gordon Ramsay and BurGR definitely did not disappoint. It was so good that my husband and I had lunch at BurGR two days in a row during our short stay in Vegas. Had we been there another day, we sadly probably would have gone again!  Even though there appears to be a long line in Planet Hollywood waiting to get a table, the line moves rather quickly. The staff are incredibly friendly, helpful, and efficient. It was also great to see managers moving around and helping wherever was needed. And if you're a fan of the show Hell's Kitchen, you'll be able to see one of the show chefs in the kitchen that is viewable from the sitting area.  As starters, we had the jalapeno poppers. The order comes with about 6 that are presented in shot glasses with sauce. The sauce has cheddar, bacon, and ranch.. mmm... One of the poppers is supposed to be especially \"hot\" because the jalapeno seeds are left in; however, we like spicy and they all tasted pretty much mild to us. Nonetheless, they were sooo good. You definitely get several bites from each popper so if you're thinking 6 isn't much for two, it was just the perfect amount.   Besides... we ordered the truffle parmesan fries in addition to our burgers. One order of fries was just enough to share between the two of us and we sadly didn't even finish them! They were delicious but with the poppers, burgers, and drinks.. it was a lot of food!   As for the burgers, I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger on both days. It had cheese, avocado, roasted tomatoes, and roasted jalapeno peppers. I also added duck bacon to it, which was great. My husband tried the Uber Cheese Burger that had fontina cheese, raclette cheese, and goat cheese (he added duck bacon) as well as the Blue Burger with blue cheese and arugula (with of course, duck bacon). We loved each burger and devoured them. The burgers have so much flavor and are cooked perfectly that there is really no need to add anything to them (like condiments, etc). The flavors soaked into the burger buns and made each bite so delicious.   We look forward to visiting there again soon. Although we did not order them, we ogled over plates that came out. We kept seeing gigantic chili hot dogs come out smothered with so much good stuff that we hope to try. The shakes all looked amazing and if I hadn't been so smitten with their bar drinks, I might have tried one. Can't wait to experience BurGR again!"}
{"text":"I've never seen Hell's Kitchen or any of Gordon Ramsay's other shows, but I've heard 'of' him. Our friends were staying at PH so we decided to meet up for lunch. On YELP (cough) it says you can make reservations but when we called concierge they said no, it's first come first serve. Luckily, the line wasn't very long yet - 10-minutes before they opened for lunch service (11am). The hostesses slowly seating people which is typical since you don't want to overwhelm the kitchen with orders coming in at once. When we were seated, the service was awesome and the team of people taking orders, delivering and cleaning up were friendly AND efficient. The manager stopped by twice to check in with us as well.  + lots of tvs (good ambiance i guess, haha) + high tech (drink menu on ipads, survey with check on iphone) + total rewards members get -$1 nearly every menu item + onion rings are SO GOOD + hell kitchen's burger's jalapeno is VERY SPICY - I had to be a whimp and take it out +/- shakes are good but filling (and thick/heavy) - pricey (but if you can't finish your food, take it to go and it'll still be delicious later)"}
{"text":"An average burger with a lot of really good toppings. After hearing so much about how great this famous burger was we decided to give it a shot. We all ordered the famous pig burger that was  topped with pulled pork, bacon, and coleslaw.   The burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare, the pulled pork was juicy and tender , the bacon was bacon, and the coleslaw brought it all together.   Simply a great burger. It didn't come with fries but after taking a few bites your glad you got just the burger. The amazing thing was the buns held everything together and nothing fell out.   I also ordered the chocolate pudding milk shake. Decadent , rich, filling, and so good. The milkshake is probably the second best thing here next to the burger. And it's a meal all on it's own. Rich chocolate flavor and topped with the most delicious pudding.   If you're in vegas , you have to come to Burgr."}
{"text":"First: The food! My fiancé and I shared a burger and fries. It was crazy delicious! I asked for medium rare and it actually was. It was cooked perfectly with so much flavor. I'm salivating thinking about it now. Eek! And the fries! Oh my! These were definitely some of the best fries I have ever had. They were cooked so well and the amount of parmesan on every fry was perfect! If a review was just based on the food, they would have 5 stars.  The seating of the place was a little awkward. For a hyped up place with a burger and fries costing about $40 I would expect more. It felt like a cafeteria setting where you were forced to be apart of your neighbors experience as well. The people there were nice enough but it took forever to get the food.  The food was amazing though...sooooo...4 stars!"}
{"text":"Food is really great. Had the Earth burger (amazing) and my husband had the Hell's Kitchen. Also the gooey fries. The wait was ridiculous. VIPs kept jumping the line, which they are allowed to do, but it's distastefully done right in front of the rest of the patrons standing in queue. The worst part is NOT ONE staff member smiled in the hour and a half it took us to get our table, eat and leave. (Lunch) Our waitress never returned except to give us the bill. Everyone looks like they hate their job and the vibe was completely thrown off because of this \"I don't want to work here\" attitude.  It was awkward and uncomfortable. By the time we left - we were full of delicious food, but angry from the noise, packed seating arrangement and terrible service from employees whom I suspect do not really care for their jobs. I wouldn't return, although I would get take out if it were available. Don't plan to have a conversation here. It's like eating in a construction zone."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch/dinner. Had a specialty beer and truffle fries with Parmesan cheese with a big burger. I did have to wait for my beer which I saw the bartender set up on the counter but the waitress took about 5 min to pick it up and bring to me, not sure why because she picked up other drinks just not mine. This is one of those places that they give you ketchup in a cup, won't let you have the bottle on the table probably because it isn't fancy enough. My food was good, the service could have been quicker on all accounts."}
{"text":"I will have to say it's the second best burger I have ever had.  #1 is Kumas in Chicago."}
{"text":"Best poppers ever! Period. There's a little bit of a wait as in all Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. The food was amazing and we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I went today at 4pm with another friend to see what a Gordon Ramsay restaurant was like.  It only took around 15 minutes to get seated.  The ambience in the restaurant was fantastic.  I could tell that a lot of thought was put into how the floor was laid out.  The service was somewhat slow.  It took our waiter a while to get our food and drink orders, and to pick up our check at the end.  I expected better service out of a restaurant of this caliber.  The food was delicious!  I got the Truffle Parmesan Fries, and the Gordon Ramsay Burger.  While the fries were somewhat basic, the truffle aioli sauce was out of this world!  I would definitely order this.  The Gordon Ramsay Burger was just plain great.  It wasn't super exciting, but it wasn't tasteless either.  The burger would have been better if the bun was crunchier, and the beef was juicer.  All in all, I would recommend going to Burgr in Las Vegas.  While the burgers aren't going to blow you away, the experience will definitely be one to remember."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken burger extremely flavorful and juicy, Milkshakes are amazing. The service was on point, good selection of burgers and other items"}
{"text":"Well, we were hoping for an amazing experience since we love Gordon Ramsey and his name is behind it. Plus it's Vegas!!  Well not so much!  Hey I'm cool with standing in line waiting for an empty table since it's a popular place. Plus the Fire displays keep you excited. We were seated and our waiter was super friendly (he gets a 5star). We ordered a couple beers and an appetizer. I asked the waiter if they offered other buns since I'm allergic to sesame. They said yes so I ordered a burger. Since that's what this place is known for. When our main course was delivered of course I still got a nice sesame covered hell bun. Lol. Well, you can't take it off cause there are so many seeds it already got into the meat. So the head kitchen said they would make a fresh new one. However his customer service skills need a major adjustment. Besides him being on his cell phone texting, talking to staff about his DUI, then not showing any kindness over my allergy!!  Then by the time my burger came out, my wife's burger was cold!!  Hello!!! We were having a date night and wanted to eat together not separate. When we complained slightly about this, they offered to make another for my wife, then mine would be cold!! Wow. And they didn't even offer a discount or nothing... Btw burger was fantastic. But thanks to chef DUI, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"A good/great burger!    But expect to wait in 30min-1hr lines or longer if you have a big party.  Service is over the top!  Fries are good but not outstanding.  Jalapeno poppers were probably my favorite part of the meal.  I didn't really think it was a better burger than I get in my favorite burger joint back home.  And this was twice the cost.    On the other hand, its pretty cool to eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant if you are a fan."}
{"text":"Literally just finished eating at this restaurant. I came for a birthday dinner with two others. This would be my 1st time eating at a celebrity restaurant so my expectations where high. Let me get to it: there is line outside like most popular restaurants but the wait was very short, 4 minutes was our wait time. Mind you its 11pm. The staff was friendly & fast. The food & drink menu options were few. The fun thing about the food is that it comes 2x bigger or smaller than the normal size. However it means nothing if the food has no kick to it. I ordered the fury chicken wings with & side of onion rings & a whiskey cherry lemonade . One of my friends ordered a chili hot dog with side of mozzarella sticks & the other friend ordered chicken sliders.  The onion rings, hot dog & mozzarella sticks came in huge portions. The chicken wings & sliders came in bite size portions. I did not enjoy my onion rings for two reasons: #1 they were coated in a liquid batter instead of bread crumbs & #2 there was more coating than onion which was in fact not completely cooked when I opened it. The wings were deliciously spicy & the blue cheese was on point however a couple of my wings were under cooked.  All in all the decor of the restaurant is cool to look at & the music is loud & enjoyable but I don't think the food is worth the prices"}
{"text":"Without doubt Best burger ive ever eaten. Burger was soo delicious and cooked to absolute perfection. Well kept tying each others burgers and see which one was better and i think my ultimate cheese burger with avocado and a garlic truffle aoli was the best. Also you MUST try the jalapone poppers and truffle fries and onion rings. Everything we had was exceptional and i cant wait to go back there again."}
{"text":"In town for a conference and had to try a GR restaurant. A little different than what I was expecting - a good thing. Atmosphere was laid back, relaxed. They have a nice selection of alcoholic beverages and craft beer. Menu was expansive but simple.   Burgers were perfectly sized and absolutely delicious. Got the Gooey Fries - wow those things were delicious. Had multiple people stop and ask what they were. Wish I still had room for dessert!  Hope to go back."}
{"text":"Hands down the most amazing burgers you will ever eat. Came here for lunch one day and came back three more times on the same trip. My whole family loved it. I highly recommend the farm burger and the onion rings over the fries. We also had the jalapeno poppers. For those over 21 I also recommend the Baby Guinness  which is a shot and does not contain beer. It's pretty great. The wait time to get in is significant but worth it."}
{"text":"Seriously? My burger tasted like a frozen pre formed patty from Costco and the \"brioche\" bun was mealy. The fries were an even bigger disappointment. The ends of them had rotten spots on them and I could not even remotely taste any truffle flavor. All of this can be yours for $30 per person! It makes me want to go to my local burger place where I spend $8 for total deliciousness and real truffle fries and give them a $22 tip for doing it right."}
{"text":"This is a fabulous place for burgers in Las Vegas.  I had the \"plain\" old American burger and it was really tasty.  The gourmet bun combined with the really well seasoned beef made this an excellent choice.  Even got to see Chef Christina the Hells Kitchen winner who is now exec chef for Burgr. Also a great selection of beers on tap.  Do not miss this place!"}
{"text":"One of the many Gordon Ramsey restaurants in Las Vegas. This one is located in Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. Not to be confused with Planet Hollywood Restaurant inside Caesars Palace. Restaurant can get fairly busy for dinner throughout the week. Open late.   We caught a good point one evening not long ago. Staff was pleasant, friendly, efficient, yet personal. We were greeted and helped by the host with menus. Waitress was attentive and got orders for food and drink started reasonably soon after. She answered questions that we had.   Drinks were consistently filled throughout our experience. Food came out hot as we ordered for the Gooey Fries and Hell's Kitchen Burger.   Gooey Fries was a fried egg on-top of Italian meats, and herbs. The fries were crispy. The seasoning and item accompaniments were distinct and texture was appealing. Taste was on.  Hell's Kitchen Burger made with amazing fresh and delicious vegetables. Soft durable roll. Sweet tender juicy meat cooked to my temperature likeness. The burger was filling in it's own. A side of fries also was nice.  Overall the line, service, food and pricing was as expected. Exceptional.  Good delicious large portion for burger and side order of fries. Bad a little pricey but like the rest of Vegas.   I would come back. So many choices in the area."}
{"text":"It was a 30-minute wait (give them your cell # and they'll text you when the table is ready).  There were three of us.  We ordered the American (me), Euro (person #2), and the Farm (person #3).   Also ordered a side of parm fries and onion rings.  The verdict?  Good, but not \"WOW that's a juicy mother of a burger!\"  The curry ketchup was the highlight for me, but that can't be good when ketchup steals the show.  The onion rings were better than the fries.  As for the burgers... the Farm was the best."}
{"text":"my poppers were 50% smaller than the picture posted on yelp and not as good as the first time I had them :(  I also ordered the fish burger because when I was in london I had fish and chips at his restaurant and they were amazing. The fish was soggy on the bottom with the cooking oil soaking into the bun, the dill tarter sauce was flavorless and bland it even lacked salt. Pretty sad compared to my first visit I won't be back...too many other outstanding restaurants in vegas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! I would highly recommend this place! My husband and I eat there every time we come to vegas! I have tried 3 different burgers from the menu and loved them all! Fries with truffle salt is enough for 3 or 4 people to share! You will not be disappointed eating here!"}
{"text":"Probably my absolute favorite restaurant on the Strip! Whenever I have friends coming into town, I always make sure to bring them to BurGR. It's the perfect Vegas restaurant for tourists! It's not too pricey, the burger is filling, and GORDON RAMSAY!  Is it lame to have everyone in your party order the same thing? It's okay if you all get the Farm Burger.   The Farm Burger is a solid 5 out of 5. After trying some of the other burgers, the Farm definitely tops the list. Whoever thought of adding duck bacon into the mix is a genius! The fried egg already adds a kick to your palette but adding those bacon strips puts you to the edge.   Their Sweet Potato Fries is also pretty good! They serve it with two different sauces and sprinkle powdered sugar on top. Nice touch.   Now, it is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant so keep in mind that there may be a line. Try to come before the lunch/dinner rush to get seated quickly! They're pretty good with turning their tables so even then, waiting isn't too bad. If the hostess asks you if sitting at the bar is okay, say yes! You get a good view of where the magic happens so why not?!"}
{"text":"Was awesome. Was told an hour & 20 minute wait. Waited for 45. Didn't have to stand there, they texted us when our table was ready so we could walk around the mall. We were seated promptly and the waiter was really kind. Soon as I seen the Farm Burger, I knew I HAD to get it. Duck bacon, cheddar & a fried egg. Food came out really fast I was shocked being that they were really busy. Everything was so good. I should've gotten two. Great experience."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! My boyfriend and I split the wings appetizer & the burger. Both were so good. The sauce on the wings was incredible. Service was great, cant wait to be back."}
{"text":"We started off if a party of eight which is normal in #Vegas. The hostess solo us up into two booths back to back. After sitting we asked if they could combine 3 tables and they did. Our server came by and explained  the drink menu and then disappeared. Someone in our party had to raise her hand to get our server's attention. She came and took out order after another delay.  Finally we ordered and out food came. The sweet potato fries was the best I've ever had and others at the table agreed. The burger was probably one of the best I've ever taste. The food gets 5 starts but the service was non existent...hopefully it was just our server and not representative of the entire staff... Overall I'll return and surely recommend."}
{"text":"We came for dinner after a long event at MGM. The seating hostess was friendly and the wait was only 10 or 15 min.   The decor was bright and clean, although it was a little weird that half the restaurant was exposed to the casino floor. But this seems to be the popular design of new restaurants on the Strip today.   Our waitress was very friendly, energetic, and helpful. Prices were very reasonable and the food was done very well. We enjoyed the Kale Caesar Salad, the Hog Burger, the Farm Burger, truffle fries, and shake #4. The portions were very generous that we ended up taking a lot of leftovers to go. Definitely up to par with Gordon Ramsay standards."}
{"text":"Wait was too damn long. Had to wait about 2 hours to get a table and then about 45 mins to get the food. I ordered Hell's Burgr and it was very tasteless and bland, also I got the truffle fries and they Okay not too bad. Service sucked but I can understand due to the rush."}
{"text":"Awesome Burger place. Alex, our server was awesome and helpful. He quickly paired the menu with our food desire. I had the Blue Burger and my wife the Pork Belly appetizer. We also had the Gooey Fries, it was scrumptious.  My hamburger was exceptional, the bun floated on the Burger. The place is a little loud but that's because so many come for the good food. I could go on but suffice it to say give this place a try when in Vegas. You will be glad you did."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and had to wait about 45 minutes, but totally worth it! The menu was varied and had a lot of interesting choices. The servers were excellent and very friendly and I have to say both burgers we ordered were very good. The buns were excellent and the meat was cooked to perfection. If I had to put a negative it would be the physical location of the restaurant, it seemed kind of squished into the Planet Hollywood and was a bit noisy. Nonetheless we would definitely be back and we enjoyed our experience tremendously! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"After all these years of passing by this eye appealing restaurant, I finally dined in during my last trip to Vegas.   The wait was about 30-45 mins long but just leave the hostess your number and they will send you a text when your table is ready.  The wait went by pretty quickly but I was STARVING by the time we sat down.    FOOD: I ordered their Fish & Crisp sandwich while my boyfriend ordered their Hell's Kitchen Burger.  We also ordered their Sweet Potato fries to share.  I really enjoyed my Fish & Crisp sandwich.  It's not something I would normally order but I'm so glad I did!  I'm not a huge burger person so this was an excellent alternate.  Not only was the presentation unique but the fish was lightly battered and fried to perfection.  The dill tartar sauce was amazing and they piled a bunch of salt and vinegar \"chips\" on top of your sandwich which added a nice crunch and texture overall.  But FYI, these \"chips\" aren't your ordinary chips but instead they are stringy crisps!   Cant say much about the Hells Kitchen Burger as I only had a bite and I don't really remember much of it but my boyfriend said he enjoyed it!  Plus it's one of the popular burgers they serve here.  The sweet potato fries were amaaaaazing.  It comes with two different dipping sauces and a powdered sugar shaker so you can control how much you want sprinkled on top!  I personally didn't like the two dipping sauces so I ate the fries by itself and I couldn't stop eating them!  MUST GET!  SERVICE & ETC: The restaurant was busy!  My only real complaint is that our table STANK SO BAD.  Like they're constantly using dirty old rags to wipe down the tables and place mats.  We had to flag down someone to get our table rewiped and had them take away the place mats... and also, towards the front of the restaurant where the hostesses are...it literally smelled like someone threw up on the ground or something..It smelled so funky there too!!? Aside from that, I'm glad I finally got to try this place out!  This place did not disappoint."}
{"text":"From the moment we stepped in BurGR (correction: outside of the establishment, since there's always a line to get in), the atmosphere was inviting and loud (in a good way).  Tip: sit by the kitchen so you'll get to see the chefs prepare/distribute dishes.  You'll get to see the portion sizes and what food look like more accurately than the menu pictures.    We sat down by the kitchen, by the fries station side.  We were amazed by the portion size, though it's justified by the $8-$14 price on the menu.  The truffle fries were amazing, but make sure you get it to share.  You'll get two types of sauces to dip in - a curry/wasabi tasting ketchup, and a marinara style ketchup.  Both delicious.  For appetizer, we got the bao bun.  While several other reviewers mentioned the dough being a bit much, the real key is how you bite into the bun.  Bite it sideways (like how you would normally eat tacos) and you'll get a perfect amount of meat-to-bun ratio.  Bite it straight-up and you'll experience the \"too much bun\" moment.    As for the burger, we went for the farm burger, hold the cheddar, and add avocado.  Of course burger is an intimate food selection that deviates from one person to the next.  To me, BurGR's farm burger was perfectly cooked (medium), with the right amount of avocado and fried eggs.  The only small downside is the burger buns - normally they butter them up and make them a bit greasy.  I'd skip the butter part and have it a little toasted.  The drink selection didn't blow us away, but by the time we got done with the bao buns, the burger and 1/6 of the fries, we were stuffed.    The last piece of observation - the chefs/waiters/waitresses practiced a fairly decent cleaning regime.  What I meant by that is it's above subway restaurants, way above iHOP, but still below what's considered acceptable.  For example, if you touch the outside of the gloves with your dirty hands, the gloves are now dirty.  The scissors used to cut ketchup bags weren't cleaned.  And  twice I saw people who cooked the fries picked up spillover fries from other parts of the kitchen counter and threw them in the fryer.  Yikes."}
{"text":"Finally!!  I get to eat a burger.    It's been 40 days and 40 nights since I had some red meat.  I admit, I am a carnivore and giving up red meat was no easy task.  So what is the first thing I'm craving?  A burger, of course.  So, BurGR it is.    Service:   Unique situation when we arrived for dinner.  It was around 5 PM on Easter and they were closed.  Apparently, BurGR had a small fire the night before and all the inspections kept them from opening on time. Not a big deal to me.  Safety first, right?  Once they opened for business, we were seated right away and our orders were taken fairly quick.  Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full.  So far, so good.   The Food: -American Burger:  I'm old fashion when it comes to a beef burger and decided to keep it simple.  But I also needed to make up for being meatless for so long.  So, I had them add an extra patty.  This was perfect, this was huge.  My burger was cooked medium-well and it was both tasty & juicy.  My only regret...wish I didn't get this with cheese.  The cheese was a little salty and took away from the burger. I managed to eat the whole thing.  Obviously, I was satisfied.  Obviously, I recommend.    -Sweet Potato Fries:  This was Ty W's and Lore D's order.  But that didn't stop me from taking a few pieces.  I thought that these were pretty good. They hook up the fries here.  It's big enough for 4.    -Truffle Parmesan Fries:  I read reviews that this is really good. I thought that they were just okay.  Maybe it's the batch that we got.  I just thought that the ones that I had were a little under cooked.  Still tasted good, though.   Overall, I recommend BurGR if you're craving a decent burger.  Price is about average to what you expect to pay in a restaurant on the strip, especially one owned by Gordon Ramsay.    PS:  I had another great dinner with Terri R (who happened to come here last year after giving up red meat for 40 days), Terri's teen, Ty W, Lore D, and their son.  I had a great time and we all deMELished our burgers."}
{"text":"Definitely an over exaggerated place to eat at. My friend talked about eating at one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants to eat because she's obsessed with his show.   The anticipation was great and when we arrived the place was crowded but with a pretty fast paced line to get you in. Once my friend and I were seated, we ordered the hella kitchen burger, jalapeño poppers, gooey fries and I got a hotdog.   Jalapeño poppers were meh.. Panko coating is yummy but they are all dipped in a ranch sauce that was too much and the inside cheese mixture they use in the popper tasted like fake cheese. I saw another table eat one and had them take it away because they didn't like it. We attempted to finish what we could.   Gooey fries- yum! However there was so much cheese and different cheeses that it was overwhelming. Maybe a tad less and maybe two kinds of cheese would work.   Hot dog- forget which one I got but it had chili peppers on top with raw jalapeño slices in a sesame like bun. I are some of the sausage and that was it. For $12? Costco's 1.50 hot dog tastes much better. I had to scrape off all the chili pepper because it was literally like a red mush sprawled on top.   Service- Our server was nice except at the end she took SOOOO long to get our bill. After we finished we probably waited a good 15-20mins bored out of our minds. The manager passed by us and we flagged her down for to go boxes. Our server also saw my friends credit card out and took it with her to close us out even tho I had mine out. (Prob didn't see) when she walked off my friend was like \"wait close out like the alcohol or the bill?!?)   Overall the hype was not happening with this place. Food presentation is great but the quality and taste is just average. Def. a tourist trap."}
{"text":"I would never pay $15 for a burger. But after clubbing with my boyfriend we decided to go eat here. We didn't wait that long since it was late at night. However, let me tell you, during the day a wait for 1 or 2 people can take up to 45 minutes. If you come with 3 or more people you can make reservation. You give them your phone number and then they will text you when your table to ready. You have 10 minutes to claim your table. (I know this because I made reservation my second time that I came here.)   The first time I bite into the burger my mouth exploded. It was so flavorful and so juicy that I was nearly going to die of sensory overload. The truffle fries were bomb as well along with the aioli sauce. -drools- The funny part about this is that I almost finished my burger but my boyfriend didn't. This says a lot because I usually always have leftovers.   The second time I went, I showed my friends this place and we all ordered. Once our food came out all you hear is moaning from the deliciousness of the food. So if you want a damn good burger, definitely go try a Gordon Ramsay's burger! Living in LA, I secretly crave for it sometimes!"}
{"text":"Well spank my ass and call me Sally! We had to wait over an hour in line(HUNGOVER) to get a table, but it was worth it. I don't know if it was my hangover aching for greasy, delicious food, but I had over a year to sit on this review and this place serves some delicious ass meat cakes."}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen burger BLEW ME AWAY.  I'm a big burger guy and this place has one of the best burgers I've EVER had.  It's juicy, fresh, and the fresh ground beef is to die for.  One bite and all the flavors burst in your mouth like the flames that adorn the entrance.  (google it, you'll see what I mean)  Chef Ramsay does it again, I WILL be back!    LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"The food was good tasting, you get a lot, the fries were pricey though.  Service seemed slow for how many people were behind the bar and walking around the tables.  All in all disappointing  for something with Gordon Ramsay's name on it.  I've definitely have had better burgers.  Although I can also say I'd likely never give a burger place a 5 star review, so 3 stars is pretty good for just a burger."}
{"text":"By far one of the best burgers I've ever had, I ordered the Euro Burger. We also ordered the Parmesan Truffle fries, chicken wings and Granny Smith salad. The salad was perfect, light and crisp, well balanced flavor. The fries were awful...the waitress agreed that most people weren't pleased with them. We also had a random guy walk up to us in line while waiting to be seated warning us not to get the fries because the ketchup was nasty...he was right! It wasn't just the ketchup that was bad, the fries had a bad consistency and the truffle sauce wasn't much to get excited about. The wing were ok, a little sweeter that I like my spicy wings to be. Our waitstaff was very attentive and professional, the kitchen manager was sending out burgers before the appetizers which really ticked several people off, but we sent them back and they corrected it. I deducted the 2 stars because the kitchen staff was off and the fries were so bad and I hated throwing $10 in the garbage."}
{"text":"Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger with Shake #5 (replaced coffee with chocolate).   There were a group of us and we all loved the burgers.  Service was also excellent and they were willing to change the toppings around (both take off and substitute) to your heart desires.....They are big burgers so didn't have a chance to go again to try another one..."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers! Could do without the fries. Definitely try the burgers here. They might take a while but they are worth the wait. Good service as well."}
{"text":"Seriously where have all these 4/5 stars come from? Possibly one of the worst burgers I've had in a long time if not ever. Dry, overcooked, under seasoned, Gordon should be ashamed of this place. Fries were 11 dollars, yes that's right 11 dollars! Give it a miss!!"}
{"text":"This burger spot is located inside Planet Hollywood. The restaurant is very large and they open until midnight. I came around 9:30 PM and waited about 25 minutes for a table. Getting our food took a really long time. I tried the foie gras burger and the chantrelle mushroom burger. The best part about the burger was how perfectly cooked and tender the meat was. The meat was probably the best burger meat I have tried. It tasted really fresh and juicy. Their menu is really unique with a little hole that props up to allow cutlery to sit in the middle. They have a cool fire sign display that showcases the restaurants name and money. They sells tons of Gordon Ramsay swag (hats, shirts, etc.). Their milkshakes sounded amazing but I felt too guilty about eating a burger already. The chairs inside aren't very comfortable. The waitresses all wear super short and tight skirt/dresses."}
{"text":"We came in around 11:15 am so we were seated right away and didn't need to wait in line. Our orders were taken right away but after that, waiting for the food took a little too long, maybe around 20-30 mins.   I have been watching Gordon Ramsay for a long time now so I was expecting great food. I ordered Farm Burger while the hubby ordered the Hell's Kitchen. We both shared the Parmesan Fries with ketchup and truffle aioli dip. The dip was amazing and flavorful. Other than that, everything was okay. Not amazing, not distasteful. The burgers look small but they will surely make you full. We also got the Oreo Shake with Creme Brulee pudding and oreo cookie and it was too sweet for my liking.   I believe this place is overhyped because of GR's name."}
{"text":"Burger was okay. Had about all appetizers jalapeño poppers, truffle fries,onion rings. Waiter was amazing. Food was just okay though nothing to write home about. I had the truffle burger ,bf had pork burger he said it was ok. Other people at table said Their burger was ok too. Definitely overrated!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town! I have been here numerous times and it never gets old."}
{"text":"Food great  but Jared's service snot so great.  Rolls his eyes when I change my order. My 1st time here and I think the service should be better for a $15 burger that doesn't come with fries"}
{"text":"Great turkey burger, moist and well-seasoned. Reasonable prices and ok service. It was only about half full because close to closing time and it felt like the waitress was taking a long time between trips to our table."}
{"text":"Stopped here for Lunch with a group of 4. Wait time about 10 min in the line for 4 people. Waiter was attentive and helpful. Ordered Onion rings for the table and they, along with the spice ketchup were the best I've ever had! Everyone at the table except me orderd a different burger and they we're all very happy with their different choices. As for me, I ordered the crispy fish and chips sandwich. Wow! That was So delicious I highly recommend this as you have probably never had anything quite like it. As for the truffle parmigiano fries... the flavor was good but would be so much better if they were skinny crispy fries instead of the larger thick cut.  My suggestion would be to order the onion rings to share and maybe even share a burger or the fish as it was so much food and we were all way too full to try the shakes... which sounded delish."}
{"text":"Because I ordered to-go, I was allowed to skip the line outside the door and order immediately. My food came out in a timely manner and the girl that took care of me was very prompt, personable, genuine, and sweet! I immediately took my food to my hotel room and the food was still hot and very fresh. I wasted no time digging in, but was a little disappointed. I ordered the Fury Chicken Wings and the Roasted Jalapeño Poppers. The wings were big and meaty (yum!) but I did not enjoy the blue cheese in combination with the tangy sauce, but that's just my personal preference and not a poor reflection of the restaurant (usually I love blue cheese!) The jalapeño poppers had a nice breading, delicious cheese/ranch, but the jalapeños inside tasted bland and soggy! The first one I ate was pretty spicy, but the rest of the poppers had little to no spice and severely lacked that jalapeño flavor that I was craving.   I couldn't finish my meal so I wandered down stairs and ended up with a slice of pizza.   TL;DR: the fury wings were deliciously meaty, but I'd prefer to leave off the blue cheese as I'm not a huge fan of the flavor combo. The jalapeños inside the poppers were very bland and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"You don't have to wait in line if you're a platinum member!  The whole Menu is  cheaper if you are A platinum total rewards member (: The chicken burger is to die for the fries are also really good ! The burgers look small nut they are filing"}
{"text":"Best burger ever,, the place is nice and yhe staff are so kind and friendly  the food was great as you would expect from gordon,, but i faond a stanw on my napkin so that was strange considering it's goooordooon,,"}
{"text":"Now that the hype is over the wait isnt so long.  Actually  at times there is no wait at all.  They have also started using ipads to showcase menu items that may have been explained above most guests culinary experience i.e, the banana  shake was not called a banana  shake originally  lol.  The food. Mmmmmm the farm burger.  Have you ever had duck bacon?  Forget slapping my momma I wanna slap G. Ramsey.  I can eat 2 of these burgers its that good.  Also sampled the blue burger, it was also delish.  The parm truffle fries a lil on the salty side for me but hey I was sober, shame on me for being sober in vegas lol.    The now named banana  shake, best shake I've  ever had in my entire life, hands down."}
{"text":"GReat burgers! I did the Euro burger and it was outstanding. Also did the Parmesan and truffle fries...wicked good! Service at the bar was a little slow. The prices are a little wacky too. It was like $15 for the burger and $10 the fries...granted, both were amazing, but for $15 for a friggin burger...dude is getting rich(er) off this place for sure. Probably the best \"celebrity chef\" joint I've been to (and I've been to ALOT of them)."}
{"text":"Me: Bites into the burger Me: 0.0 Me: (does best impersonation of Gordon Ramsay) this burger is #$(@* AMAZING!  So how does BurGR stack up against other popular burger joints in Vegas? Here is my definitive list:  1) BurGR 2) Bachi 3) Holstein ..... 100000) Burger Bar  First off, the decor here is awesome. Who doesn't love live flames everywhere, especially in the middle of PH. It's pretty much, Hell's Kitchen. ;). Onto the food! The Euro burger was a hogwash blend of aromatic truffle aioli and goat cheese. Every bite was packed with savory flavors. Additionally, the truffle fries here are darn amazing. Thick cut and fried into crispy golden slices of heaven. My gf and I agreed that the Euro burger was one of the best burgers we've ever had!  Overall, my only complaints were the snotty server and long wait time to be seated and fed (45 minutes). She was not very friendly and she gave us attitude when we tried to use our total rewards card... However, even questionable service still doesn't compare to the impeccable food. Furthermore, the long wait only made us savor the food more.   If this is the kitchen in Hell... and Gordon Ramsay is the lord of the underworld... I'm fine with trading my soul for this burger. XD."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, had the Hell's Kitchen. My wife had the chili Dawg. Great, quick service. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had to visit on my B-day week celebration. Left this as my last place to eat. For a good reason. I'm not a fully dedicated foodie. So take this with a grain of salt. The European burger is the best burger ice efrr tried. Combine it with sweet potatoe fries, is simply a delight. The place does get busy so expect a waiting period. Burgers are cooked medium rare which is ok with me. Have tried Ramsey's steak and this being much less expensive does not disappoint. Will go again when in the Vegas area. FOR SURE!!!!"}
{"text":"I rarely ever write a review on YELP, but in this case I just had to. First on a positive note, the food was delicious. We had the Blue Burger, onion rings, and truffle fries. Now what made it even better was the exceptional service we received from David. He took time from his very busy hour and educated us on the restaurant,  Gordon Ramsey, the menu and then surprisingly pointed out that Christina Wilson, winner of Hell's Kitchen, was the executive chef!! We had our 12 year old daughter with us who was also in awe. I made it a point to walk up to say hello and THANK HER! She was busy texting or something on her phone, barely looked up and said \"Youre welcome\" Wait! What? You're welcome?? Wow!!! Rude! Does she think she's to good to take 30 seconds to acknowledge a customer? What if I had been a food critic or a celebrity?  Shame on you Christina!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The chicken yardbird was amazing. It was a little spicy and the sweet pickles on it made it so much better. We had both the fries and sweet potato fries. Both were good. But just having one is enough for two people.   If you can, try to share. Drinks are a bit on the high end but they were good."}
{"text":"So, normally when I come to Baegas for a burger, I go to Bachi Burger. But for once I decided to try out BurGR.   So it's always a wait, so come early so you can get on the wait text list. Which was great, it let me gamble while I was waiting.   So the menu is quite simple really, and I was oddly expecting something not so usual. We got the wings and all of got the farm burger and shared the truffle fries. All in all, when I read duck bacon and fried egg, it didn't scream \"different\". But it did sound appetizing compared to all the other burgers. I was sort of expecting like unique. The flavors were great, and holy aioli, the aioli that came with the fries was amazing. I used it on my burger too!   My only gripe is the level of uniqueness in the menu and the fact that I ordered my burger rare and it came out medium. I mean seriously, 15 bucks for a burger, and you can't nail the meat temp?  It was great to try something different, and it was just average, but I think Ill stick to my Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"The burgers were fantastic and they had the best fries. My burger with duck bacon and over medium egg was delicious!  The appetizer wings were the best."}
{"text":"Just had the* coconut strawberry milkshake, fries, american burg and wings. Asked for well done and still got medium rare. The fries were fresh but not really prepared well. The milk shake mightt bethel best part until it is room temp and just tastes bad. Tried it as i am a fan of gordan but pretty disappponted.  I wont be back. Maybe the chef needs to be yelled at what is the diff between well done n medium rare."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the burgers are good... But would I say amazing? No. For the price of a burger (without fries, or drink, or anything) I would expect to be blown away, and unfortunately this fell short.   It's still getting a 3 star, because the food was good just expensive for something I would expect anywhere. The nice thing was the location and that we did get in relatively quickly for their being a line."}
{"text":"Though I find Gordon Ramsay to be a bit of an obnoxious personality, I have to admit his food is generally above average, so it wasn't surprising that we found ourselves at his newish burger joint in Caesar's Palace.  A quick perusal of the menu led me to the Hell's Kitchen Burger (asadero cheese + roasted jalapeños + avocado + oven roasted tomatoes + jalapeño pesto aïoli). When I ordered, the waiter asked me how I wanted it cooked and when I said medium, he explained that it would be pink all the way through. A good sign indeed.  I decided to start with the creatively-named Shake #4 (crème brûlée pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie). This glorious concoction essentially contains a lower half that's an Oreo milkshake and a top portion of crème brûlée pudding and it might just be the best damn milkshake I've ever had.  The burger didn't fare quite as well, although it was admittedly very good. The biggest problem was that the patty itself was cooked more to medium-well than to medium, as there wasn't much of that aforementioned pinkness to be found. (I can only imagine how Ramsay would've reacted if he had discovered such an error.) The condiments all worked quite well, although I did remove the avocado because it was just too plentiful and distracting."}
{"text":"Great dining experience. Expect to wait in line though. Sat at the bar so could see the kitchen at work. Great farm burger and sweet potato fries.  Nice and passionate staff."}
{"text":"Heard really great things about this place and decided to give it a try. I ordered the Farm burger which was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had. The only downside was it took long for the food after ordering. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan, so this was on my list of places to eat.   There wasn't a wait, although we went on a weekday for lunch (HUGE line on the weekend.) The wait staff was great! Very friendly and attentive.   The burgers take 20-25 minutes to prepare, and honestly, weren't the best I've ever had. Tasty and prepared as asked, but as I said, not the best. Felt like your standard \"gourmet\" burger. Many of them seemed to have simple options and nothing to really push them over the top, which was a disappointment from Gordon's other restaurants I've dined at. The total cost was a bit pricey for what we had - two of us, two burgers, two beers, and shared fries for approx. $65. Yes, it's Vegas, but it wasn't too much to rave home about.   Next time, I'd much rather choose Gordon Ramsay's Pub in Caesar's for the same price, knowing I would have one of the best experiences and meals!"}
{"text":"We were rather excited that we were able to just walk in without waiting at BurGR but afterwards we found out that the kitchen was backordered making wait for food about 30 minutes....not cool. And we didn't know this until AFTER we told our waitress to bring our food out together....!!  That said, what we did receive and ultimately eat was pretty exceptional. I definitely enjoyed my Farm Burger done medium rare. The burger was juicy and cooked perfectly. The duck breast bacon added that extra salty bite to the burger and well, eggs on burgers are one of my favorite things...would have preferred it over easy...but it wasn't a deal breaker. It was definitely up there in terms of best burgers I've had.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their burger choices. We also shared sides of the onion rings and the truffle fries. The fries were a bit over hyped in my opinion. Perhaps it's just my preference, but steak fries are just not my thing. The top fries basically took all the truffle parm and had all the flavor. The bottom pieces were more like large potato pieces. However, where the fries fell a little short, the onion rings more than made up for it. The onion was sweet and tender and not stringy at all. The portion size was also huge!  We also tried the oreo + creme brulee shake. When in Vegas right? It was definitely one of the most gluttonous things I have ever consumed...but was it delicious? Most definitely. Getting a bit of cookie with some custard and some burnt sugar on top....oh yes!  Gordon Ramsey's smiling face staring at you all night is also hilarious!"}
{"text":"Great meal. My wife and I ate here before seeing O at Bellagio. I had the pork burger and my wife had the burger with mango salsa.  We also shared an order of onion rings.  Burgers were great, service was excellent.  Beer-battered onion rings were awesome.  Loved it and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I've been here in the past, the restaurant was 4 or 5 star good.  So we popped in again for our last meal in Vegas.  Not sure what happened this visit.. BUT.  1.  The fries were old tasting/stale and not hot.  Not acceptable. 2.  Both our burgers were cold as well!  Both burger patties and cheese were barely warm, even the buns were not properly fresh/hot.  I sent the fries back, and I'm not sure if we were given a fresh batch or if whoever was in charge of fries just REFRIED our batch.. but they were way overcooked, hard, dry.  Nothing like they should be.  For a near $50 meal I expect a lot better quality control.  Pretty appalling.  Sorry Gordon.  Hope you do something about it!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Loved the food!  We had onion rings, poppers, sweet potato fries, truffle fries, and burgers. Best food I ate in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, with a delightful layering of spicy peppers and avocado. Our server was very personable and prompt. Fun beer list. It's a typical noisy environment with lots of tvs. Beautiful flaming Burgr sign at the entrance."}
{"text":"Damn good burgers. Fresh, simple, delicious."}
{"text":"A mi en lo particular me encantaron, muy buen servicio, había muchísima gente pero valió la pena la espera. Altamente recomendable."}
{"text":"This was our second time to Burgr. We don't recall being amazed at our first experience, however, my husband wanted a burger.  It was a Saturday so we expected it to be busy. Thankfully we were able to skip the line and be seated right away. The server was nice, but unfortunately, the food took nearly an hour to arrive. Despite being a Saturday, the restaurant didn't seem packed, so the wait was unacceptable. Our server, while nice, never stopped to say, \"sorry about the wait\" or \"your food should be out in a few minutes.\"  My husband got the farm burger. He was pleased. I got the Caesar salad and the gooey fries. The gooey fries had definitely been sitting out because they were not hot and the cheese no longer gooey. Big disappointment. My Caesar was good, but not exceptional for Gordon Ramsey. Overall, negative for the long wait and prices and positive for  while the atmosphere and kind servers.  Will only go back for the milkshakes which we had the first time. SO good."}
{"text":"Look no further, by far the best burger in Vegas ... Hell's Kitchen burger with a creme brûlée Oreo shake!!!!! Yuuummmmm!! I love this place!!  .."}
{"text":"Great Food!! It's one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, so of course everything is delicious and cooked to perfection. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was amazing and had great flavor & spice. My boyfriend and I shared the Truffle Fries, which were also delicious. Everything was reasonably priced considering it's in Las Vegas and a famous chef's restaurant. The staff was also super nice and helpful. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today for lunch by myself.   After talking with the hostess I was sat at the bar avoiding the 45 minute wait for tables.  Due to that I didn't really get to see much of the inside of the restaurant besides what I consider to be a ridiculous photo of Ramsey looking surprised surrounded by BURGR signs.  I will admit that the front logo for this place is awesome as it is surrounded by fire.  Like at his other places I found the cutlery to be cool also as the knife sat on its blade because of the curved shaft.  For my lunch entree I decided to order the Hell's Kitchen burger along with an order of the truffle fries. The burger was to come with asadero cheese, roasted jalepenos, avocado and tomato while the fries were hand cut with truffle Parmesan, truffle salt and truffle aioli.  Whenever my burger came out I was happy to see that the tomato was more reminiscent of a sun dried tomato and less of a raw tomato.  I actually think that helped to enhance the burger as the sweetness of that combined with the creaminess of the avocado, spiciness of the jalapeno and savoriness of the meat and cheese all went together for a well thought out burger.  The jalapeno was also spicy enough to leave a slight lingering burn but not spicy enough to cause you to grab some water.  The bun was also decent, toasted a bit which helped to keep the burger together while I was eating it.  So overall I was happy with the burger.  The fries were also pretty darn good as they came in a conical shaped service vessel and were layered with the truffle parmesan on the top.  I could easily notice the truffle flavor on my first couple of bites and really enjoyed it although the flavoring seemed to dissipate a bit the further into the fries I got.  The fries themselves were cooked nicely and were crispy and not soggy at all.  The bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in the future.  All of the food that I ate here was good and the burger that I had was the best conceived burger that I have had in a while and it really worked. Yeah, you are paying around $15 for a burger without any fries but I feel like that's almost the going rate in a casino in Vegas.  Beyond that I think that I could have easily split the order of fries with my fiance as a side to the burger and been happy."}
{"text":"I have now been 4 times. On my last vegas visit I went twice. I'm not a burger person but I love these. I get mine well done and my favorite so far is the Brittania"}
{"text":"Literally the best burgers I've had. Ever. The restaurant is a simple burger orientated place but with a very elegant and sophisticated twist. Very modern and spotless cleanliness. Food presentation is excellent compared to other restaurants in the same category. And food preparation is excellent you don't wait long after you order to receive the food!  Now down to the actual food, had the farm burger and Hell's Kitchen burger cooked medium well. The meat was tender and cooked perfectly to your order, the bread bun is toasted perfectly with just the right amount of butter. And of course the burger toppings were top notch, when you receive your burger it looks like it came out of a food magazine.   When you take that first bite to the last, not a single drop of juices or fat come off and hit the plate. All the taste is sealed inside the burger and you'll know by the end of the meal by looking at your plate you just had a high quality burger by the fact your plate will be clean free of the juices. The portion is also spot on and perfectly hits the spot without the heavy feeling after eating at most other burger joints.  The fries are also a work of art, perfectly cooked and served with 2 unique but perfect blends of ketchup, chipotle & curry ketchup. One order is enough to enjoy and share with 2 people.  All in all its Gordon Ramsay's spin on something simple as a burger joint, you won't be disappointed. There will be a bit of a wait to get in (45 min to 1 hour) but that's what you get for good, healthy, quality food. This place is priced above average so prepare a little dinner for 2 will be around $40 with drinks."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Burger I have ever had in my life.  The Hog Burger wasn't just quality, the taste was amazing and every bite had you wanting more.  It's wasn't no small portion either the burger was perfect in size and the taste was incredible.  Not to mention the sweet potato fries , regular fries, and onion rings which were to die for."}
{"text":"The truffle fires was outstanding, but one star down for the slow service and the hostess's bad attitude"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Gordon Ramsey's BurGr!  It was semi hard to find at first because it wasn't on the directory. I love being able to go grab some Fat Tuesdays while waiting for our table. They send you a text when it's ready. SOOO much easier than standing in line HANGRY! It was an hour and half wait at around 3:30pm on a Saturday. After buzzing and chilling, we got the text and was seated immediately! Servers were great and attentive.    We ordered the Truffle Parmesan fries which was delicious! Loved the truffle aioli sauce it came with! The ketchup was different. Bun bao was delicious as well but not mind blowing, cause well, we aren't in an authentic Asian restaurant.    I got the farm burgr (medium rare) because of the popularity on yelp. Not sure if I was full or too buzzed off of some Fat Tuesday but it was mediocre at best.  The beef was extremely soft, but the burger was a bit bland. Wished I had some aioli in there!   Would definitely still come back and try a different burger next time!"}
{"text":"There is a line for those with only two people in their party. For parties of 3 or more, you have to add your name to the list. The normal wait is roughly 60-90 minutes.   Service is great. Absolutely no complaints at all.  Food: Honey pig bao buns: 3 stars. Very little meat and just A-OK. Nothing special. Hog burger: 4 stars Truffle parmesan fries: 4 stars. Comes with 2 different sauces. Onion rings: 5 stars. Very good especially when dipped into the sauces. Oreo shake: Definite 5 stars. Highly suggest getting this! It has a layer of creme brûlée on top!  Overall I would say more of a 3 1/2 star experience.  Tip:  The waitresses wear skirts that are wayyyyy too short so ladies beware of your mens wandering eyes. This is a warning not to be taken lightly :)"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 Stars = Super safe bet, happy to come back often!  Huge fan of Gordon.  Funny, ass bastard bloke, great chef.  - Speaking of which, order the Arrogant Bastard Ale, it was deliciously, craftingly cold, refreshing and strong alcohol content.  That beer is trouble for me.  Too easy to ask for more.  - Farm Burger.  The one everyone speaks of, was solid.  Juicy ass burger.  Sharp cheddar, duck breast bacon was all very satisfying.  I could eat many many of these.  It is not a \"Big\" burger.  But well worth the $15.  As I've noted before (in previous LobsterME review), small portion for higher dollar is a non issues as long as the quality is good.  Of disappointment however was the brioche bread was not toasted perfectly like so many other reviews note.    - Fish and Crisp Sandwich.  MY HIGHLIGHT here.  Airy, Crispy, Crunchy, delicious Cod.  Damn, probably best fish n chips I ever had.  Perfect tartar sauce.  Salt n Vinegar crisps are SO ADDICTING.  Unlike the Brioche on the Farm Burger, the Brioche on this Fish burger was toasted perfectly crunchy.  My picture does not do this burger any justice.  Order this if you are a Fish N Chips fan.    - Truffle Fries.  One of the most overrated things I've ever eaten.  I must have gotten a bad batch.  Couple pieces were great, hot, crispy, potatoey, others seemed lukewarm and just lame.  Truffle was not good quality at all.  What a waste of $11.  Next time will try the jalapeno poppers and sweet potato fries.  Even though the truffle fries was a huge disappointment, the brioche on the farm burger was not toasted perfectly, both burgers were absolutely worth the hype along with the ale.  As this is a lower priced Gordon restaurant, for the most part it represents his high qualities thus a strong 3.5 Star from me.  Gordon, go fix those truffle fries and toast those buns better!"}
{"text":"These are the BEST BURGERS hands down, that I have EVER tasted in my life!!! If you have a chance to stop by while in Vegas, please try one of these delectable treats, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my bucket list items was to visit a Gordon Ramsey establishment. Our first night in Vegas and I insisted on eating there. As I had been looking forward to eating at BurGR since booking our vacation I was sooo disappointed. We ordered the gooey fries to find a hair half way thru our order. It was melted in the cheese. Then our burgers come, my burger was the only one to come out like I wanted medium( pink was closer to rare). The rest of the table had asked for medium well and got them almost as pink as my own. We spoke to two managers about our poor luck with the kitchen and got the big brush off. Our server was kind enough to remove the fries from our bill but no apology came for our bad experience."}
{"text":"Lacking a good local beer selection, maybe I just didn't comprehend the lack of local beers in a city like Las Vegas. That said I took the recommended squatter's hop riot for $7. Beer was served in a highball glass, not a pint glass, a bit pretentious for my taste.  The location of this is a bit odd, in the lobby of Planet Hollywood, but attempting to separate itself. My original server was great, but as soon as I made my food order he seemingly disappeared. A kitchen assistant delivered my food, and another server bussing table refilled my water. A third server brought and processed my check, I never saw my original server again. Having come at opening, that was a bit of a surprise.  At $15, the hell's kitchen burger left me wanting a bit more, as in quality not in quantity. For something that's supposed to be the best, it just isn't. Good yes, best no. It's a cut above average, but nothing that blew me away.   Maybe a trip to the $100+ per person Ramsay Steakhouse would leave a better impression on me."}
{"text":"Being a local and trying to find a restaurant that is worth the money is very hard. I can say that I had a very high expectation of this place because of the name Gordon Ransay. It fulfilled every expectation I had and I will recommend this place to anyone who wants a fantastic burger experience.  We arrived and waited in line for about 15 minutes, which is not bad all for what is was and located. We took our 2 year old and they were accommodating and had our table ready with high chair and all. Our waitress was very friendly and even tried winning over our son with 2 Oreo cookies, which was very nice of her.  We looked over the bar menu and they have several beer on tap and in bottles, but come on try one on tap because they are different. My husband ordered the Innis and Gunn beer because that is the one Chef Ramsay drinks all the time and is his favorite. I don't like beer but let me tell you, this beer was AMAZING!!!!!!!!!   We ordered 2 Southern Yardbird Burgers. It's comes with a chicken burger, sharp cheddar, mustard bbq sauce, pickles (bread & butter), and butter lettuce. We also added the Just Fries that came with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup. The chicken burger were so big and thick that I couldn't even finish mine and I was full half way through it. The taste of it was so amazing that I would order this every time I go back. Such an AMAZING burger.  I highly recommend this place to everyone in my family and to all my friends. So everyone that comes to Vegas and want a reasonable priced meal at a famous chefs restaurant, I recommend Gordon Ramsay's BurGR."}
{"text":"Best Burger On the Strip.   My husband and I have tried most burger places on the strip and BurGR is, hands down, our favorite. He always gets his burger completely plain - meat + bun - which is a guaranteed way to find out how good the meat is. BurGR's is fantastic. Juicy, high quality, delicious meat! And the buns are big and fluffy with sesame seeds which I love. They're starting with just a great base here. All of the ingredients are obviously very high quality.   I'm more adventurous and like to try different flavor combinations. I've tried most and The Farm Burger is my favorite. A server we'd gotten to know suggested I try adding avocado and it took it from fantastic to WOW! The Hell's Kitchen burger is spicy and delicious so if you like spicy try that. I love arugula so I tried the Euro Burger but it was just a bit rich for me. Delicious but really rich.   We've tried all of the fries and the Just Fries are just right. They're the thick kind and are served with 2 different really nice ketchups - curry and chipotle.   I tried the Kale Apple Ceasar Salad which, if you like those 3 items (Kale, apples, a ceaser) you will love! And the shakes are completely decadent. But to be honest, once we'd been a few times I stopped trying any of the extras because a burger + 1/2 an order of fries is a meal! The servings are large and filling.   I noticed some complaints about the wait between ordering and being served. It's true that if it's busy, it can be slow. We don't really mind as the food is so good and clearly made fresh. We treat it more as a yummy dinner out than a quick bite. I think some people expect very quick service with a burger. This is more of a sit down meal. But our solution if we're really hungry is to to order one order fries as an appetizer right when we sit down and order drinks. The serving is so big we can easily nosh on that and still have plenty left over when the actual burgers, and any other items, arrive.   We keep trying new places and BurGR keeps winning! In fact, I might just need a Farm Burger for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I think it's Over-Rated!!!  Service: NO GOOD, our server just kept on talking to another server through out our entire dining period. She doesn't look pleasant at all. No smiles what so ever!!!  Food: Not bad, but NOT AMAZING either. Chocolate Shake was good.  Price is definitely on the expensive side for a burger place, but it's in Vegas. So i don't blame them."}
{"text":"When we got their at 11:30 for lunch the place was just about empty and we had a 45 minute wait because they didn't have enough staff! What the heck is that about on Presidents weekend, no staff? When we were finally seated the place field up fast. The food was okay but nothing special and that was kinda disappointing being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Sometimes simpler is better, our $120 lunch tab wasn't reflected in our food unfortunately and that is why I gave it only two stars."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite burger spots! The poppers are fresh and have real kick! The duck bacon on The Farm Burger was unreal, but as much as I loved it. The Hog Burger took it's place as king. Now with all this talk of burgers, DO NOT miss out on the hotdogs, one of the best Iv'e had in town."}
{"text":"Best burger in Vegas. It's one of the must for us when we are in Vegas, at least 4 times a year. Most of the time (not always) the line moves fast. If they say half an hour give it a shot, you may be surprised how fast it moves or keep an eye on one of the bar spots."}
{"text":"I will keep it simple. It's very rare to enjoy a duck bacon burger cooked the way I ordered it as much as this burger. I also want to add that the fries at Gordon Ramsey burger where just as good as the burger.  As other reviews have written they had a long wait to be seated, I was lucky to have a short 10 min wait."}
{"text":"I order the farm burger and jalapeño poppers. Both were amazing. The flavors were spot on and the dips we tried..curry ketchup, truffle aioli and regular ketchup was fresh and flavorful....yes I said regular ketchup...it tasted like ketchup was made in house. One thing I noticed was the duck bacon in the burger made the burger a bit oily..I would probably leave it on the side next time..but that's just a preference."}
{"text":"Damn good burgers. I had the truffle burger and it was top notch -- cooked perfectly, well- seasoned, and juicy. Expect to wait in line. Also, I highly recommend sharing the fries as you're paying 8-12 for them but they're large enough to share between 3 people."}
{"text":"One of two best burgers I've ever had - hands down! The other was at Plan Check in West LA (you can bet I have a review for it).  I shared the Euro Burger (truffle aïoli, goat cheese + arugula, oven roasted tomato) with a friend, which ended up being a good idea since we filled up on roasted jalapeño poppers and beer-battered Maui onion rings first. The burger was so juicy, with tons of flavor from each of the elements. Only thing missing were bacon and avocado, but purely because I looove those two ingredients on any burger or sandwich.  Service is big with me, so I was happy that it was as equally exquisite as the food. Our waiter was extremely friendly and accomodating. Even pulled the manager out to have a laugh with us.  Although I wasn't able to get to BurGR in my last visit to Vegas, I plan to make it a regular stop for a casual, yet high-quality meal."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try a Gordon Ramsey restaurant on this trip.  Unfortunately, this experience left a lot to be desired.  If we were going to a Red Robin it would have been fine - but at a place where you are paying top dollar for a burger and the chief-owner touts himself to be the master of the dining experience, adequate is not acceptable.  The food was fine, nothing special about the burger, I had the apple, kale Caesar salad, it had 4 paper thin slices of apple and 5 shreds of kale leaves with sub-par dressing.  The fries were over done and tastes old.  The only shining spot was the shake which was amazing.  As far as service,we waited for 30 minutes after finishing our appetizer and no one came by our table.  I finally had to flag down our waitress who informed me that that it does take a long time and she should have told me that.  Which seems absurd that a burger place would take that long.  When our appetizer, chicken sliders, came out moments after placing the order.  In a place like Vegas where there are so many amazing options, don't waste a meal here."}
{"text":"I tried the hog burger and my boyfriend had the truffle burger.. They were both amazing!! But the fries were disappointing and overpriced. We shared the truffle fries which were okay. If I were to go back I would only order a burger."}
{"text":"GR BurGR perfectly fits in Vegas. The grand fire window displays the WOW factor when you enter the place.   Ordered the Farm Burger and it was highly recommended by the waitress. I was pretty pleased with the recommendation. The burger came with a fried egg and duck bacon.   It was definitely tasty and perfectly cooked! Not too rare and well done. The truffle fries ordered was my least favorite as it was soggy and too salty.   Overall, it was a good experience in terms of the wait staff and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I both love burgers so thinking if you put them with a famous chef backing them it should be good.   My first thought was that the chairs are too low for the table.  My mouth was practically at table height so I didn't like that.   The restaurant is set up nicely and the fire decoration in front is cool.  My second thought is that if you have your drink options on an IPad only and wifi isn't working then you have no drink menus.   This is exactly what happened so we had to keep tossing out beer names to our server to see if they had them.   Really annoying!  I ordered a cheeseburger and specified I didn't want any pink when cooked.  My husband ordered the farm burger and wanted a little pink.   You guessed it, they Mixed it up and I had pink.  Not sure if its a server issue or the kitchen. We also ordered the fries which come with two types of ketchup.   Overall, my burger was good.  The bun was fresh and the burger was a nice size.  My husband really like his.  The flavor of the egg really added a \"Pop\" to the sandwich.   The fries were disappointing.   No real flavor unless you dipped them in ketchup.  Speaking of ketchup, the server dropped a container of ketchup and it splashed all over the man sitting next to us.   He had a nice Izod shirt on and it stained it terribly.    Couldn't believe they actually brought the guy a bill.    We were told he felt funny about them paying for his wife's salad, but we felt they shouldn't even have given him the option. Not cool, as I am sure the shirt is ruined.  Glad we tried it, but not likely to hurry back."}
{"text":"The food, service, and atmosphere were great and the prices were very reasonable for a restaurant right on the strip. It was not very original or mind blowingly awesome. I had the onion rings for an appetizer. They were sprinkled with Parmesan and came with ranch and spicy ketchup. Very tasty. For a main course I had the American burger. It had a sesame seed bun, red onions, butter lettuce, pickle, and cheddar cheese on a medium-well cooked patty.  Also very tasty. Over all it was really good, just not amazing."}
{"text":"I finally tried this place after my diehard-Gordon-Ramsay-fan-girl girlfriend (yes, you read that correctly) kept pushing to eat here since our last Vegas trip.  Hmmm I would have to say that I expected more from Mr. Ramsay.  We tried the jalepeno popper shooters, parmesan fries, and sweet potato fries for appetizers.  Nothing really spectacular, but I did enjoy their sauces.  For my burger, I debated between the Farm Burger (that fried egg tempts me every time..) and the Hell's Kitchen burger.  I finally opted for the Hell's Kitchen burger and just added a fried egg to it.  It was disappointing because I was expecting something spicier and nothing about it was that memorable.  It was also not worth it to add an egg for $3 in my opinion.  Despite the average food, I do have to admit that the set up of the restaurant and presentation of the food was impressive.  All the little details from when you enter to the end of the meal were really cool.  Service was okay, but I did like how our server showed us all the drinks and desserts through his iPad.  The presentation of the check came in a little compartment with an iPhone to rate the service.  Wthell..nifty haha. Overall, this is just one of those places you would want to stop by to experience it, but would not come back for seconds."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 or 4 times and it never disappoints! All the burgers here are delicious and you can't go wrong with them! I've tried the gordon burger, truffle, and farm burger! They were all so good! You also must get the truffle fries and onion rings!! It makes the meal that much better!   Try to go before rush hour because the wait can be long!! Trust me! There is a bar area where you can wait, which is nice. Some times when it gets super crowded they let you give them your phone number so they'll text you when your table is ready! :)   Def worth a try if you're in vegas and craving juicy burgers!"}
{"text":"Fancy burgers are not my thing.  I am going to bounce over to Bobby's Burger Palace to compare.  The restaurant frontage is neat with a curvy gas burning Sin curve-esque decoration."}
{"text":"WOW! First time here yesterday and I must say it was delicious!!   It's located at a convenient place in Plant Hollywood casinos and wasn't a hard place to find.   FOOD: The truffle cheese fries are AMAZING! The two burgers I highly recommend are the \"EURO BURGER\" AND \"The farm\" burger. I'm a sucker for eggs and the farm had a egg on top of duck bacon. YUMM.  DRINKS: Large selection of beer and waiters have lots of knowledge of the drinks  Service: Friendly waitress/waiter LONG time to get food since it was so crowded. took about 24 minutes to get all the orders out to our party.   I came here around 12pm before the pool party and there was no wait. However, after I left the restaurant around 1pm there was a long line out the door! SO COME EARLY!   Overall:  Pros: +good food +good selection of beer  +plenty of tv's to watch sports   Cons: +long wait for food +long wait to get seated +buns are kind of dry."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat was spot on and cooked as asked (medium). The balance of the ingredients (bleu cheese, arugula) was amazing and felt very tasty. I ordered sweet potato fries with sugar and a caramel and jalapeno sauce. They were unbelievably good. The waiting time to seat is huge. At least 45 minutes. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here with Jason W. below last Christmas.  We were both sitting next to the management staff that were pouring over the reviews-they take excellence seriously.  They want to please the customer.  I'm being honest when I say they have excellent food and service. The quality of the burger is out of this world.  I felt compelled to write a review given how much they're striving to be the best-and I agree wholeheartedly they've met the challenge.  A fantastic burger."}
{"text":"We got there around 10:45a.m. as we'd heard to be there early if you want to avoid the lines. We played some slots for a bit then saw people beginning to stir so we decided we would be first in line. The person up front was very personable and talked over the menu with us while we waited. By the time they opened at 11a.m. and we wered seated we looked outside and there was a very long line of people. We were so glad we came early. I ordered the Farm Burger and my fiance' ordered the portabello burger. We also shared O rings. The rings were unique in a good way. The ketchup and cheddar ranch were great dipping sauces for those O rings. I tried a bit of the portabello burger and it was very good. But here's where it all came together for me. Upon my first bite into the Farm Burger as the egg yolk flowed down the burger like beautiful flowing lava life went into slow motion for just a few moments. Then the words \"this is THE BEST hamburger I have ever eaten\" came out of my mouth by the 3rd bite. The next time I go to Vegas I am going back. It's not even a question. The combo of that perfectly cooked medium high quality burger patty, with the fried egg, and the lightly gamey/ candy like flavor of the duck bacon. It is as close to the perfect burger for my taste buds that I've ever had. Also, the service was top notch. But it doesn't matter. They could have served me that burger in a styrofoam container with a plastic knife and fork and never refilled my drink and I still would have given 5 stars. If burgers have a Hall Of Fame the Farm Burger belongs there."}
{"text":"Location excellent! Food excellent! Service (Alex with the glasses) excellent! You couldn't ask for a better experience!!!"}
{"text":"For a party of 3 at peak hours on a Friday night, I waited 25 minutes to get seated. Not bad at all. Service was good for a very busy dinner service, and the server was friendly and made to check up on us often.  Ordered a Hell's Kitchen Burger, plus an order of Truffle Fries to share. The truffle fries were great--Well seasoned and crispy. The Hell's Kitchen burger was cooked to a perfect, moist medium rare, and I loved how the jalapeño aioli and roasted jalapeños gave it a really great kick.   Sounds like I should give a higher rating right? There was just one major issue I had...The burger was underseasoned :( It seriously tasted like the meat patty had NO salt. So tragic. To me, an under-seasoned burger is a pretty big crime for a burger joint. I'm sure Gordon Ramsay himself would say the same.  I took a bite of my boyfriend's Euro Burger, and this didn't seem to a problem. Maybe because the sharpness of the goat cheese compared to the milder flavor of my asadero cheese, or maybe because his burger was actually seasoned better than mine. Regardless, I was still disappointed with my own order, which is why I can't give this place any more than 3 stars.  SO CLOSE to a 4 or 5 star rating, it actually makes me really sad. Hopefully I'll be able to update this with a higher star rating next time I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"I am still salivating over the delicious meal I had here!    Starters: my 3 college buddies and I shared the beer battered maui onion rings (the best onion rings I've ever had) along with the truffle parmesan fries.  The portions were so generous we didn't even finish them!   Milkshake: I didn't even know pudding on top of a milkshake could be a thing but oh boy does it take this icy treat to the next level!  I opted for Shake #4 (crème brûlée pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie) and it was so delicious that I inhaled it in record time.  It was one of those genius concoctions in which I wish it was in a bottomless glass.  Word of advice: use the large straw they give as a way to scoop up every last drip of pudding   Burger: I've had so many incredible burgers from the East to the West Coast that I wasn't expecting to be as blown away by the Hell's Kitchen Burger as I was! They grind the patty blend onsite and this leads to the most flavorful and juicy burger you could ever imagine.  Add in the asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato and you have one of the most flavorful culinary experiences of all-time."}
{"text":"THE best burger I have EVER had!!! Without a doubt! My sister and I shared the Farm Burger and added avocado. Perfect to share since we also ordered the delicious Honey Bao Buns, Truffle Parmesan Fries, and Onion Rings! ALL worth it! The patty was cooked perfectly, my only complaint is that the egg was cooked well done and I asked for it over medium (-.5 star).   The wait is a bit long for large parties, but I can see why! If u are a party of 2, you can wait in line to be seated which seemed to go by fast. They don't do take out which kinda sucks (-.5 star).   All in all this place is definitely worth waiting and trying. The Master Chef knows his burgers and shows it at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Worst place to eat, they forget to bring your food and ask that you pay for the food you did not get."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this place. We went around 5pm on a Saturday and believe or not the wait was minimal. The service was great from the start. Waiter was friendly and explained the menu in detail. I had the hella kitchen burgr, my wife the farm burgr. Our burgrs were fine and they would've received 4 stars but my sons burgr was way too salty and the sweet potato fries was way to sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, staff was attentive and good looking, prices were expected. The wait was an hour and a half on a Friday, but what are you gonna do? Go grab a table at the bar right outside and enjoy!  Be prepared for meat sweats if you eat the whole thing."}
{"text":"Food was really good! We all got burgers and happy stomachs in return. Our server Dominic was really helpful and attentive. Scott the manager was a really nice guy. We definitely received outstanding service, thank you so much!"}
{"text":"Had the farm burger wth truffle fries and Oreo shake. SHAKE IS A MUST TRY. Customer service is friendly and attentive but the lines are crazy for 2 or more. Being a solo diner I was seated immediately which was excellent. Burgers are great but not the best - the Kobe beef burger at Gordon Ramsay steak was much better."}
{"text":"I love all of the Gordon Ramsay shows... I am a big fan. However the burger restaurant does not deserve five stars at all.  It is definitely four stars... They don't have a lot of choices on the menu for different types of burgers. And the burger itself is good... But underwhelming for the price you pay. If I'm going to pay $15 for a hamburger... It better well be a really good burger.  The reason I gave it four stars and not three stars... Is that the anti-fries and the homemade ketchup along with the mayonnaise truffle sauce is absolutely wonderful.  However $12 for french fries is also ridiculous.  The service is very slow because the restaurant gets pretty busy especially at lunch and dinner times. It is best to go when they first opened and then you don't have to wait to get in... But you still have to wait for the food.  If you compare this to let's say one of my favorite burger joints... Smash burger. It really pales in comparison because of the price point. You can get a awesome smash burger... And smash fries for under $10.  Annual walk away very satisfied.  I paid $30 for a burger and fries at this place... And was good... But just did not have that wow factor I was expecting."}
{"text":"Hanging out in Vegas this weekend and staying at Paris so decided to check this out at Planet Hollywood since its next door. Have always wanted to check out one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants. Had the turkey burger (super good!) and the sweet potato fries. They were a little sweet for my taste but still good. You also get several different sauces to dip them in (house ketchup, spicy ketchup, curry, etc) so those were fun to try. If your looking for a good burger, should definitely check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey Burgr was disappointing. I ordered a MT Dew to drink, upon drinking it I realized it was flat I told the waitress I wanted to switch she told me it was an 4 dollar charge to change drinks. I argued with her until she eventually gave me a different drink. I then order the entree and I wanted to try the fries but I didn't want this massive portion but they can't make a half order or do anything for their customers. The food was good however"}
{"text":"My second visit here. I happen to be staying nearby so I walked over for dinner - since it was convenient.  It was a Monday evening and the place was busy, so I sat at the bar since I was solo. Seemed like it took a while before I received a menu from either of the 3 bartenders. Once I finally had contact with the female bartender she was attentive and friendly.   After reviewing the menu I ordered Damnation chicken ground burger, fries and a strawberry shake. The ground chicken patty was topped with a celery & carrot slaw dressing, the chicken was dry and bland tasting, fries weren't nothing out of the ordinary and my strawberry shake was so thick I could barely drink it - even with the thicker straw. My wow meter didn't move at all with this meal and I was truly disappointed this time around.   Overall - I suggest sticking to the beef burger especially for the high prices they charge here. Probably would be a while before I return if I do."}
{"text":"Such a treasured experience. We had the Hog Burger and it was a memory maker! We sat at the bar and watched the line chefs in action. What a treat to watch these professionals in action."}
{"text":"My friend and I stumbled across this place at Planet Hollywood while getting our Earl's sandwich fix. I hadn't seen this place at the end of December in 2012, and was intrigued after my experience at his steakhouse was meh. My friend who doesn't really eat hamburgers since they're not healthy had said she would be down to try this place. So we came here the next day for lunch, but the line was super long at 2 PM (next to the flames in the glass wall - very nice touch) so we decided to gamble and come back.  When we came back, there were not that many people in line, so as we waited, we of course took photos of the flamed glass wall, and perused through the menu.    We were seated quickly and liked the menu design and settings. The waiter also said we could take the menus as souveniers which was nice of them to let the diners know before hand. Our waiter was very friendly and let us peruse the iPad drink menu. We both got something fruity, and they were tasty, but wish they had mashed up the mint rather than full leaves.  I told my friend the photos of the jalapeno poppers looked amazing, so we started off with that. They were the BEST jalapeno poppers ever. 6 Huge roasted peppers with cheddar bacon inside and in a shot glass of cheddar ranch sauce. I saved a shot of the ranch to dip with my fries later on.  A lot of yelpers talked about the Farm Burger, with duck breast bacon and a fried egg, but I was more intrigued by the Euro burger since I'm a sucker for goat cheese and arugula. And with truffle aioli? No brainer. My friend who is not a huge GR fan went with the Hell's Kithcen Burger since she loves avocado. Our burgers were cooked to a perfect medium rare. The burgers are not huge but perfect size for me at least. My Euro Burger was spot on, loved all the flavors. My friend's Hell's kitchen burger was okay, but we liked our own better.   We also ordered a side of the truffle parmesean fries, which is definitley made for sharing. Super tasty and my friend commented it comes with homemade ketchup, so has a marinara taste to it.  Overall, great service, great food. Decently priced and $1 off each item for Total Rewards members. The most memorable meal in Vegas for me that trip, and would definitley be back."}
{"text":"We stayed in two rooms in Planet Hollywood and got a $100 ($50 each) credit towards food in the restaurant. Gordon Ramsay BurGR was one of the qualifying restaurant. For 6 people, it came out to $150+ for 6 premium burgers, one order of fries, two appetizers, and all water.  We don't each much gourmet burgers so can't compare with other places, but it was alright - nothing to write home about. I got the farm burger which was okay - not much flavor to it. My brother enjoyed his euro burger. Couldn't find much to praise about the different burgers we ordered. Most were medium cook to well done and it didn't include fries.  The chicken wings were good. The truffle fries were okay.  Service was good to great. I'm surprised the server remember which person got which burger without having to ask."}
{"text":"Overall good experience, except for their lame excuses. So we had ordered the Gordon Ramsey special (pork) well done and two other burgers - one medium rare and one medium. The special came out fairly pink for pork. The medium and medium rare seemed to be switched. When we mentioned that the pork was requested well done, their response was \"the pork always comes out a little pink.\" Well that should have been mentioned beforehand for the pregnant wife. Also, the supposed \"medium\" burger was bleeding. They said that's how their medium looks. And the medium rare definitely looked medium. Must have been switched. But they always came up with excuses without rectifying the situation. How hard was it to bring the burger back to cook a little more? Seems like they definitely have a Gordon Ramsey mentality here - too snotty to take directions from their customers' requests."}
{"text":"I went there may 31st. I mean the best part of the meal was our waitress n our appetizer.  The burger? Meh! Way over rated and priced. I make better ones at home.  11 dollars for fries? I mean they better knock my socks off. Well they are still on....the wings were amazing. I would have the appetizer for my main course. Sadly. I probably won't come back unless I'm forced to."}
{"text":"Burgers and truffle fries here are delish! Glad we were given dining certificates from attending a Hilton Grand Vacations presentation while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive in Vegas, otherwise we might have passed this place up."}
{"text":"We sat down and were greeted by a nice guy who took our order and then left us to sit for 20 minutes without even coming back to check on us, or letting us know our food was almost ready. We literally starved to death and he never came and checked on us and now we're writing this review from the grave.    Just kidding.. We left because of the terrible service.    We did order to-go on a different occasion and the burgers left us with some serious heartburn and unsettled stomach."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Burger I've ever had. I've been here about 4 times and each time I receive exceptional customer service and even better food!"}
{"text":"Before coming to Vegas, I did A LOT of research on 1) places I wanted to see, 2) restaurants I wanted to eat at and yada yada.   Olive Garden? Check. Cheesecake Factory? Duh! What's this? THE Gordon Ramsay has a burger place? I HAVE to check it out!  Just a general tip for anyone going out to eat for supper... try to be at the location before 5pm. After this time, you'll have to wait in a line and everything will be crazy busy.  SO! This was the first restaurant my group & I ate at after a LOOOOOONG day of flights and travel. We get there, and the restaurant isn't busy. We go up to the hostesses and ask for a table for 3. We got seated by a blonde girl who DEFINITELY had some sass going.  That said, our waitress was incredible. She knew the menu, she knew the cocktails, she knew what to recommend based on our tastes... she was a breath of fresh air! The cocktails we ordered were quite good and fresh.  We started off  by sharing a plate of onion rings and o... m... g... They ruined onion rings for me. I will NEVER be able to find onion rings THAT good anywhere else. They were crispy and fresh with delicious seasoning and sauces. To die for.  I had a veggie burger. I see you rolling your eyes at me. I'm no vegan... and trust me I love my meat... but after 12 hrs of travel, I needed something lighter on the stomach. Let me tell YOU after trying this burger I'm seriously considering the vegetarian life. It was tasty and plentiful, I was full after eating it.  The only downer? The burger menu literally is just that one your plate - the burger. No sides or beverage included :/ so YA the place is a little expensive but I've noticed most Vegas places are. Unless you go to mcdonalds o.O  lovedlovedloved it! I can't wait to come back to Vegas just to eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Had a burger and fries here . Just a great experience. They have different options for fries (is not included when you buy a burger)  I got JUST FRIES but they were still tasty along with all the dipping sauces. I got the Farm Burger with duck bacon . Mouth watering . Sorry duck... You were yummy ."}
{"text":"I've only had a to-go order here, therefore, my review is mainly for the food itself and not for the service or ambiance of the restaurant.   Came here a couple weeks ago because my family was in town and they love Gordon Ramsay. We ordered a couple Hell's Kitchen and Farm burgers.   The good: 1. Girls at the front were very friendly and helpful. I read a couple reviews that said they were rude, but we did come at a time when they're not busy at all, so I think that helps. My parents, being the Asian tourists they are, took pics all over the restaurant and they weren't hassled. 2. Burgers are great, perfectly seasoned.  3. Menu is cute.  The bad, or I guess the so-so: 1. Girl who helped me order said that they grill the burger pretty rare here and told me to order Medium Well when I said I like my burger pink in the middle. I've ordered a burger Medium at the Counter and it came out pretty much still bloody red in the middle, so I thought BurGR is the same way. I ordered mine Medium....there was hardly any pink in the center. It looks like a Medium Well on its way to become Well Done really soon. It was overcooked. The burger still tastes great but I was disappointed they didn't cook it to my liking.  2. Price. Obviously I do understand I'm paying extra because first, it's inside a Planet Hollywood on the Strip, and second, it's Gordon frickin' Ramsay. But the burger was pretty small for $15 and it doesn't come with fries (most gourmet burger places don't include it). Fries are another $7 - $10 so you'll be spending $22 - $25 for burger and fries. Maybe I could justify the price if I were sitting down, enjoying the atmosphere or watching sports. But I wasn't.  I want to come back to dine in, and also try the jalapeno poppers which look amazing. If you do get a to-go order, check and make sure they cook the burger right before you leave.  Tip: use your Total Rewards card! $1 cheaper for almost every item."}
{"text":"Went to experience Gordon Ramsay BurGR on Halloween and it did not disappoint.  It was very busy but our waitress was great and very attentive. She explained the drink menu and told us the special of the day. The drink menu is interactive on an Ipad which is cool. I ordered a jalapeno margarita and it was delicious - expensive as Hell at $14 but what do you expect, it's Gordon Ramsay and it's Vegas.   We started off with the roasted jalapeno poppers. They were very good. Served in six individual little shot glasses filled with bacon ranch. We all really enjoyed these. I had the damnation chicken burger which was amazing! It had carrot and celery slaw with buffalo sauce and ranch and maytag bleu cheese. The flavor was incredible. Our table also had an order of the garlic parmesan truffle fries. They were good but not my favorite. For the price I don't think I would order them again. I would try the onion rings instead.  Overall my experience here was great. Service was good, food was amazing. It is expensive but it is worth it. You are paying for both the food and the experience."}
{"text":"Word to the wise; for parties of 3 or more, see the hostess to get a text appointment set up and skip waiting in the long line.  Our wait was only 25 minutes so we walked through the Miracle Mile mall area for a few.  We were texted our table was ready so we walked back and was seated right by the busy kitchen. Our waitress Anabel came over, introduced herself and took our drink orders. We then ordered our food and after answering many of our questions, changing our order a couple times while she patiently waited, we decided on 2 burgers, a Yardbird chicken burger, side of fries and side of onion rings and the cold soba noodle salads. Oh, and a app of the chicken wings. Everything was really good, and our service was awesome, super attentive.  Located in Planet Hollywood and connected in the Miracle Mile shops, this is a good stop if a burger is what you're craving.  Total bill (minus tip) was $98 and change."}
{"text":"Ok I need to leave a 1 star for Gordon Ramsay - pub and grill but first... Let me take a selfie... No kidding I actually need to state BURGR is super duper. Absolutely loved it. Left pub and grill disappointed last night but glad we are leaving Vegas with BURGR in my stomach!   Hands down best meal of the weekend!"}
{"text":"my 50th birthday luncheon was spent here, that evening I spent it in the restroom, SICK from food poisoning from a RAW FARM BURGER, I am soo disappointed, and disgusted by the fact that i spent my birthday wish on Gordan Ramsey Burgr and got ILL, i ordered a medium cooked farm burger, got an ice cold,  blood running on my plate burger, i took two bites and had to send it back, this is something i would not expect from here, but that's just what i got... SHAME ON YOU GORDAN RAMSEY BURGR."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of Gordon Ramsey- I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was delicious! But their fries and onion rings may need a revisit from Gordon Ramsey :( but overall it's a great experience."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place every time I'm in Vegas, and I finally got to try it out last night. The wait times are always 1.5-2.5 hours. The good thing about it is that they will text you when you're table is ready so that you can gamble or walk around to kill time. Our waitress is really friendly and service was good. I ordered jalapeño poppers and a Hell's Kitchen burger. Be careful with the jalapeños here!!! It's soooo spicy. Super super spicy!! My mouth was burning for a while, I usually love spicy food and can handle it, but their peppers were probably ghost peppers. I love their truffle fries and sauces for the appetizers. There's so much flavor and the ketchup also has it's own different flavor to it doesn't taste like any other ordinary ketchup. The fire burning in front of the restaurant is pretty catchy too! It's about $15 for a burger. Prices are decent, but I think it's worth it for a good gourmet burger"}
{"text":"I really like Gordon Ramsey and I've seen almost every episode of his Kitchen Nightmares - my husband got me into them and we've watched them all together - so I was really excited to give this place a try.  A few family members came into town so we wanted to take them somewhere special (but casual) that they could only do in Vegas so BurGR got the vote.    First off, the line to get a table is INSANE.  I'm not sure how (other than he's really cute and has great dimples) but we somehow got a table in about 20 minutes.  That part was great.  The hostess and the server were all very friendly so that's always appreciated!  They use iPads for their drink menus so that's kind of fun and the options are nice (I'm pregnant though so sorry to say I didn't pay much attention to them).    We started with the hummus and it was fantastic.  Lots of flavor, great things to dip in it, we all loved it!  Then we all ordered burgers - this is where I was let down.  I got the pretty standard American burger and it's $13 for JUST the burger.  Comes with no sides at all.  Ok, fine, it's the Strip and it's Gordon Ramsey, to be expected I guess.  But... the burger was room temperature, bordering on cool to the touch, when I got it.  It had an ok flavor, nice presentation... but who wants to eat a room temp burger?  Such a bummer!  We got an order of regular fries (another $8) that my husband and I shared and they were ok also.  They were hot so that's something I guess?  My husband got the Hell's Kitchen Burger because he loves spicy foods.  He enjoyed it more than I enjoyed mine and he said his was hot.  He said he would give the place 3 stars - if I could, I would give it 2.5.  Our family members all seemed satisfied too - but no one was raving or thrilled or talking about how delicious it was.  After all the hype for Gordon, I was really disappointed.    I'll be totally honest and say that I'll give it another shot if the opportunity arises, but I'm not going to hurry back.  But it's totally possible I got an off day or even an off-shift.  And we're also still going to check out STEAK for our next special occasion.  Sincerely hoping our next experience is a better one!   One last note that I forgot, it seemed above-average in terms of noise level to me.  I had to ask our server to repeat himself a few times as well my aunt who was sitting right next to me."}
{"text":"Disclaimer Review is only based on bar service.  First, I will let you know that you will definitely have to wait to get seated but it is worth it which is not a surprise because 1) it's a Gordon Ramsey restaurant 2) it's on the strip.  I had the Hell' s kitchen burger at the bar and although the bar tender was friendly and attentive the service  (arrival of food took a while)  Although, the burger was on the pricey side, $15+ it was definitely worth it.   Definitely try this place if in Vegas just don't come on a limited time or if u are in a hurry."}
{"text":"I skipped this place a few times. Honestly the menu was not that appetizing and pricey for a hamburger.   This time I figured screw it, place is packed, gets great yelp reviews, let's give it a shot.  Slow service, cold burger and really just not that good.  Celebrity face +cheap food = Money maker.  2 burgers with 2 beers, 50 bucks.  It should have been the best damn burger ever. My dinning partners burger had a stinky meat taste to it, she barely ate any of it.  Mine was just cold.  Place is packed with servers, yet everything took so long.  Honestly Gordon Ramsay should do a kitchen nightmare episode on this place."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely terrible. The manager was the only agreeable person we came across. The burgers were okay but the truffle fries were delicious. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"See my pics & comments. GORDON  RAMSEY DOES IT AGAIN. Great atmosphere,  good food & friendly staff"}
{"text":"For some reason when I hear that a restaurant is owned by a television personality I start to prepare myself for a disappointing experience. I don't know where it comes from ( *coughs* Giadas *cough*) but I feel like it will be all hype and not flavor. Then the trepidation sinks in.   I walked up to the front of the restaurant which is stunning. There is a glass wall with these metal figures in a wave formation. They are blowing fire out the sides and it makes for a flashy sign. This is a photo opportunity for sure. If there so happens to be a line it will wrap around this so you will have plenty of time to get your selfies in.  When we were sat I had a very attentive waiter. He kept everything prompt and didn't make me feel like another table which is usually the case with most waiters. i realize you are turning tables but I would like to go to a restaurant that has all this hype and also enjoy my experience, just not the food.  We started the meal with the truffle fries. Why? Because truffle anything is delicious and if you fail at that I will deduct a star automatically. This was not one of those cases. In fact, it was one of the best truffle fries I have ever had. Scratch that, lets make it the best truffle fries that I have ever had. The reason why is the sauce it came with for you to dip in it. It had some kind of curry ketchup which wasn't anything special. I don't even remember what it taste like. Anyways, the star player was the truffle aioli. I would put this shit on everything if I could get my hands on it. But unfortunately we live in an unforgiving bitter world, so ill just have to travel in order to eat an aioli. Get this as a starter, shit, get two.   We also got these jalapeño poppers that were really good. Jalapeños to me are sort of a Russian roulette ingredient when its raw. Let me explain, if its fresh the pepper can have different degrees of heat from other of the same pepper. I seem to have gotten the hottest one because my mouth was on fire. Everyone else in my party that had one acted as if they at a bell pepper. Im addicted to heat but I could swear they gave me a habenero instead. So be warned.  Now to the burger itself, I got the uber cheese burger. It was good but I quickly regretted my order when I tried my friends farm burger. OMG, so much better than a boring cheese burger. This was one of the most flavorful burgers Ive had in awhile. The yolk dripping on all the bacon and ingredients filled me with envy. Get this burger and avoid the cheese burger. Thats what I get for going the basic route. Never again.  Finally dessert, STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING. This dessert made chocolate taste like shit. This was so delicious and its crazy how good it is. The mystery ingredient in it is dates and the sauce has whiskey in it. Two things LOATHE, but put it in this dessert and it becomes the best dessert I have ever had.... point blank... period.... end of story. Found a copycat recipe online and have been making it every week now.   Completely addicted."}
{"text":"I dined here is because I liked Gordon Ramsay style of cooking. If i can give 3.5 star rating I would. However, I'm not able to do it. I have heard from several of my friends raving about this place and saying how the burgers are so juicy and delicious. I tried their Euro burger, which I would to say is really good and they cook it perfectly for medium rare...the burger juice was still running. I also had their wings which was really good and it was my first time trying french style chicken wings. However, when I tried the truffle fries it was kind of a disappointment. The fries was super dry. I couldn't even finish it after the first two bites and I didn't even bother to take it home. Overall, the burger is really good, they had a really good list of alcohol beverages selection, their services were good, and I would come back but I don't think I would order their fries again."}
{"text":"I wanted to cry by the time I left this place. I'm a big fan and haven't been to any of his other restaurants so I was super excited to hunt this place down.  I didn't mind the wait to get in but the hour long wait to get my burger on top of waiting an hour to get in was accompanied by waiting almost another hour after I had to send my food back.  The problem? I ordered my burger medium-well but received it rare. I figured it would be a quick fix, especially since we were sitting at the bar overlooking the kitchen but it wasn't. On top of that, the service was pretty terrible. I don't think I saw the girl who was our server more than once. It wasn't until after I visibly looked upset that another server offered me coffee while I waited, which I was charged for. I was 3 hours in at this place by the time I got my food. At that point, I had told my boyfriend he could go wander if he wanted, which left me eating my burger alone with my fries that were now cold. They didn't comp any of the food and they definitely didn't show any reaction other than being annoyed during a busy night.  I don't recommend going to this place. It seemed like they didn't care at all about providing good service or food cooked the way it was ordered since they seemed to be raking in money from tourists pouring in. Won't go back. Sucks..."}
{"text":"I'm probably a bit biased because I love Ramsay's TV shows.  I also love burgers so I was dying to try this place out.  My order: Old Fashioned Uber Burger cooked medium Sweet potato fries  Result: The old fashioned was watered down too much.  This may have been due to the size of the glass, not enough ice, whatever the case may be.. it wasn't very good.  The bartender should have known not to water down the bourbon that much.  Haven't had a drink that watered down in a while.  I'll take a glass that's half full than a glass that's half full of water...  I get I'm getting my serving of bourbon, but I'd like to taste it which is why I ordered it.  The burger was photogenic when it came out.  No greens at all, just three cheeses, burger and a bun.  The burger itself was cooked more to a medium well than a medium and wasn't very juicy, although it did have a strong flavor.  The seasoning was similar to a Montreal steak seasoning.  The bun was very good and the cheeses were good as well.  The french fries started off great, but as I ate my way down the cone they became soggy and some were also undercooked. Fries are large enough to be shared by 2 people.  The service was great, nice atmosphere, but quite honestly the burgers are better at Bobby's Burger Palace.  Ramsay's has a bar, but my drink was watered down so it didn't add much to the value."}
{"text":"Two Gordon Ramsay in a row can't be wrong. Decided to stay an extra night in Vegas resulting in another epic meal time with my bestest friend in the whole wide world at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR. The spot is so chill, hella way low key compare to the Steakhouse. The food here was like so damn good. :)  Jalapeno Poppers, dank. Why? Because perfectly cut jalapenos stuffed with cheddar cheese, diced bacon, and a special house made ranch is always dank.   Fury Wings, basically like buffalo wings but kinda with Asian spices is equally good.   Hell's Kitchen Burger, so so gooood. A medium rare burger with roasted peppers, avocados, tomatoes, and a special asadero cheese. I ate as much as I could of this amazing burger.   The highlight Highlight though, is the truffle fries! I mean i just became a fan of truffle again because of these fries, simple fries with this specific truffle cheese all over it. I would just order ten orders of it and call it a night. I didn't even have any of the sweet potato fries because why would I ?   The drinks here are good too. I had this Green Tea infused Gin cocktail I barely touched because I was feeling whack for a bit, but the amount I did drink was good.   Loved this Spot!!"}
{"text":"His burgr is great.  Juicy, flavorful, and satisfying.  Tried the jalapeño poppers (spicy but good my mouth is watering now) and onion rings (pretty good).  But what is really bombtastic is their shakes.  SO good, especially with the creme brûlée pudding in it."}
{"text":"When I tell you this is the best burger I have ever had I am not over exaggerating. My husband and I both ordered the Farm burger with truffle Parmesan fries. Our burgers were cooked med rare and absolutely juicy and perfect, love at first bite melt in your mouth total food orgasm  the farm burger has duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and a delicious fried egg, all of the ingredients marry together creating the most amazing bite. If you love a good burger you have to stop in and have you a burger Gordon Ramsay does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant about going here as the prices for burgers were a bit high...but let me tell you, it is SO worth it!   We started with the roasted jalepeno poppers; they were to die for! I could eat those all day. I tried the Caribbean dream cocktail, that was delish as well. For burgers, my hubby got the Hog burger with duck bacon--awesome! And I tried the Euro burger, also very good.   We got a side of truffle fries and we are so glad we shared because the portion was huge. We couldn't get over how great the homemade ketchup was...can never have Heinz again :) Then we finished off the meal with a scrumptious Coconut pudding Strawberry shake. Would love to go back if we are in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Came here around Father's Day. The wait time was about 60 minutes, however, the nice young ladies up front asked for my cell phone number and stated they would text me when our seat would be available. This gave my family and I time to walk around Planet Hollywood without having to wait in line. About 60 minutes passed and sure enough, I got a text telling me our table was ready. When we got there, they sat us in the corner and immediately went over the menu and answered questions that my family and I had. My wife and I ordered the \"Hell Burgr\", my older son got the Fish sandwich, and my youngest got the footlong hot dog! Talk about a huge dog! My son couldn't even finish it! Before we got our meals, both my wife and I ordered a shake. She ordered a banana cream and I ordered the Oreo. To be honest, I think the shakes were the best part of our meal. I would say I enjoyed those more than the the burgers! So if you do visit Gordon's Burgr, please order one of the shakes. They are out of this world! When our meal came I was ready to dig in. The burgr was a bit dry and didn't have much flavor. My wife felt the same way about hers. A little on the dry side and overall not anything to cry home about. If Gordon was present that day, I'm sure we would have heard him in the kitchen screaming, \"What the f@#k is this? Take it back! Take it back now!\" It was busy that day since it was in fact Father's day, so maybe the chef's had a lot to cook but didn't check well in terms of how the burgers should have come out. I ordered mine medium well and my wife's was well done. But again, tasted very dry with not much juice oozing out when one takes a bite. The fries we got were quite tasty, I believe they were the garlic parmesan ones. Definitely gotta order those when visiting as well. Overall not too bad, but would I visit Gordon's again any time soon? Probably not. However, if you're with a big party and are eager to try Burgr, give it a shot and don't forget to order the shakes!"}
{"text":"Mehhh. I had better. The hype was just a hype. Maybe it made me have high expectations. Extremely well organized. But wayy too overpriced. Then again everything in Vegas is overpriced lol. Maybe I'll give it another chance some other time."}
{"text":"Wow. You know, I like watching some of the shows with Gordon in them and so I thought that this would be a great experience. I actually planned ahead to eat here because I knew the wait would be long. Checked in with the hostess and went and checked out some stores in the indoor mall.  The hostess was very nice and the server was very nice, and made a couple of suggestions.  I had read many reviews before coming here and so of course my expectations were high. I had the farm burger, and my wife had the Hell's Kitchen burger. We usually order different things so that we could try each other's. We had a couple different types of fries. My two sons both had adult size burgers as well and I tried both of theirs. Well, it wasn't even slightly impressive. Boring, bland, and a whole lot of so what.  Regardless of having high expectations this place was just not very good.  Again, the service was great, the atmosphere fun, the food was not even close to just about any burger place I have ever been to. I'm not mad...just disappointed and surprised."}
{"text":"Man, if I didn't love Gordan Ramsay so much, I would have given him lower than a 3, but part of my heart aches to give him such a low rating. Perhaps a bad night? The restaurant itself is definitely a 2.5 going on 3. But hasn't quite hit the money mark for me yet. Kind of disappointing.   I have heard lots of people rave about this place. But I ask myself...why???!!! We waited about 45 minutes for a table for 2....and there were a crap ton of people waiting in line...however, tell me why there were a sh*t ton of tables open when we were seated? I counted at least 4 open 2-person tables open and there at least 4 tables open for 3 people or more. As we sat and looked at the menu, even 20 minutes later, the 2-person tables were still empty! I was curious as to how their seating was planned out because I thought it was horrible. I know we had at least 10 others behind us in line and about 15-20 ahead of us, but for there to be open and free seats doesn't make sense to me when there are a ton of people waiting. That was annoying.  The food....they said it was a new menu so things would take a little longer. We were starving and got suckered into ordering appetizers. I will say that hands-down...them onion rings were bomb! They were crispy, \"meaty\" for onions, and really goooood. and the ranch dipping sauce? F'n off the chains. I thought I was eating some kind of naughty sour cream and onion chips or some kind of Lay's chips... literally the ranch was so good I ate it later with my burger and the poutine! It was probably the best thing that night!  On to the poutine--I've never had it until GRB...but let  me say... if you love mushrooms, then you will LOVE the freakin' poutine. I mean, UMAMI BOMB! The gravy was utterly rich and delicious. The pickled onions were a great pairing to cut the richness and saltiness of the dish, however, there wasn't enough! The duck bacon was off the hook though and I kept wanting more! I definitely loved the mushrooms and gravy and duck bacon, but I would have thought they would have offered something else to make the dish less salty and to refine it a little bit to cut the salt in the dish. Overall, I would order it again if I could cut some of the salt out of it. The curds were okay but added nothing to the dish for me. (I know that's traditional in a poutine)  Now to my dreadful burger. For 15-20 a pop for a burger, I wanted something better than an in-n-out or shake shack or anything else that has a name for itself. I ordered the hog burger which comes with speciality pork and bacon and more pork. Damn. I shouldn't have ordered so much pork x pork x pork because I was not ready for it. I love me some pork but the pork was just so greasy in the burger. The burger itself had an amazing tenderness to it and it was succulent and smokey and beautifully composed. However, it was really fatty and I almost threw up eating it. I couldn't even finish it. There was a slaw that was underneath but it did nothing but make the burger soggy. I would have preferred the pickled onions in the burger or something more refreshing added in the burger to cut the richness of the pork.   My friend ordered a different burger and felt the same way as well. I literally almost threw up trying to finish my burger but had to force myself to stop. Then when we were done I ran to my room to ear some apple slices to help take away that icky feeling.   Overall, decent service and decent food but it was too greasy and salty."}
{"text":"Extremely good burger and fries. Hell's Kitchen burger was amazing. The truffled fries were good, but their fresh-cut fries and kicked-up ketchup makes me sure the plain fries are awesome too. Server was great. Boddington's on tap is great. Only negatives was that there were about 5 ladies working at the hostess desk all talking to one another and it left it to me to stand there ignored or interrupt to be seated."}
{"text":"Farm Burger with Duck Bacon and a fried egg! Onion Rings are the best I have EVER had! Chipotle Ketchup is amazing and the hotdogs are an experience all their own! When we cone to Vegas, we eat here!"}
{"text":"Lets get straight to it. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, truffle fries and creme brûlée pudding Oreo shake. What my burger lacked in circumference in more than made up in height. We're talking about a one inch thick burger cooked to medium rare perfection. Guy Fieri's award winning Bacon Mac-n-Cheese burger was awesome but in the end the jalapeño poppers, guacamole and $6 reduction in price tag for the Hell's Kitchen burger gave it the clear edge. If you like your burgers well done, I can see the thickness of the burgers at Gordon's working against it but that's not a problem I have. The  onion rings were excellent but the truffle fries were a cut above. As a self proclaimed \"sauce guy\" I also have to give my stamp of approval to the variety of dipping sauces I tried, including the curry ketchup, chipotle ketchup and truffle aioli.   What probably surprised me the most was the creme brûlée pudding and Oreo shake. I mean just when you think you've seen, or tasted, it all... you come across something like this and are completely wowed.   Tip: One order of onion rings and truffle fries was enough for four of us. We ordered a regular fry and barely touched it.   Try it or Diet Final Word  The food was so good I almost forgot to mention how impressed I was with the service. If your looking for a gourmet burger experience without completely draining your pockets, try it!"}
{"text":"What a great dining experience! It was a quick 20 minute wait to be seated. Our server Paul, was quick getting to our table. We did shakes and burgers. Paul was honest and let us know the fries feed 2 people, so we split some.   The burgers made it out before the shakes due to an error in the kitchen. Our server caught the error and let us know what was going on. They did a great job making things right for us. The burgers were delicious. I did not have to add a thing to mine. The bun was soft and tasty, the burger was seasoned perfectly. The sweet potato fries were a hit with my friends, the regular fries were a little soggy.   When the shakes came out they were delicious. Don't be confused by the massive ingredient list on the menu, know that the flavor combinations are great.  I will be back, the food and service are both exceptional!"}
{"text":"I never expected a $15 burger to taste so good. I ordered the uber cheeseburger rare and it was perfect. A top 5 burger of my life.  The waitstaff are great too."}
{"text":"Maybe cause we were starving or because the bartender made a good recommendation but the burger at BurGR was great!  We waiting in line for about 15 min and were offered a seat at the bar at which point we were too hungry to say no!  The bartender was friendly and chatty.  Before we even looked at the menu, he recommended 2 burgers for me and my friend.   I had the Farm Burger and we split a side of sweet potato fries and each ordered a cocktail. My burger was pretty affordable at $15 with duck breast bacon, cheddar and topped with a fried egg.  What I loved about the sweet potato fries is that it was sprinkled with icing sugar!  I could not let such good fries go to waste so I finished them up even after my partner gave up.  I ordered a green tea gin cocktail which was served in a stemless martini glass...a bit strong but good.  It was a really satisfying meal for a very reasonable Vegas price!"}
{"text":"I was staying across the street and it was a cool brisk walk. The host and the servers were a delight . Great service!  I ordered the Truffle burger and fries. It was well presented and ohhhh so delicious. The flavor was extremely tantalizing and yes I did get messy. Thank goodness I had to walk back.  It is on the pricy side but this one won't let you down ! Worth every bite and every penny!!  Easy access parking or walk distance to all the hotels. Taxi ride no more than a 7 - 10 minutes from either side of the strip. Don't leave Vegas without eating here!! URGERWell worth the stop."}
{"text":"I'm a big Gordon fan having eaten at his restaurants here in Vegas and in London. The quality level doesn't change regardless of location. This is hands down the best burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"Tasty burger and delicious onion rings with an assortment of delicious sauces.  Unfortunately, I still like In-N-Out more."}
{"text":"Three stars for the following reasons, I'd do 3.5 if I could: fries were not great, tough and almost cold, we were there late at night so they could have been older but I expect more from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Another point detracted for the noise - this casino is LOUD with loud music pumping through the lobbed and the restaurant is smack dab in the middle with nothing done to tone down the loud outside music.   Now the good: this is a great burger. Great. I had the American, the meat is flavorful and clearly above average quality. Loved the cheese on this, it wasn't fake tasting and was perfectly melted. Condiments complimented rather than competed with the meat and cheese. GET A SHAKE! It is the best thing there, just wish there were a spoon with it to eat the delicious pudding off the top. A very unique and delicious shake experience.  The ketchup with the fries:  loved the chipotle, despised the curry. Just my personal opinion.   Service was great, attentive and friendly with water glasses refilled instantly despite the place being packed close to midnight. All in all a good dining experience but not as mind blowing as I would expect from a perfectionist chef."}
{"text":"AMAZING.   My dream has always been to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and this place did not disappoint. Everything from the decorations and the ambience to the food and service was top notch. We got the jalapeno poppers to share and they all came in their own individual dipping tray of sauce. We also got the parmesan fries with the truffle dipping sauce which was so bomb. The sauce was so good that we had to ask the waitress for more and she brought us out three more individual cups of it, no charge. I ended up splitting the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Euro burger with my friend, and would definitely recommend the HK burger. In fact, the whole restaurant followed the HK theme perfectly, which I was totally into since I love that show.   I also liked how for their drinks and desserts they bring out an ipad and have you scroll through the choices. Very modern and made for a great new experience.   Pricey, since it's a GR restaurant, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb diggity! My husband and I have been here a few times now since it opened. It's located inside the Planet Hollywood Casino and has a casual, hip vibe to it.  I'm not a huge fan of hamburger meat, but they offer chicken burgers as well. I ordered mine with blue cheese, slaw, and spicy mayo. My husband ordered his hamburger basically the same way, minus the slaw. They were both excellent. The fries are large enough for two people and there are a few options as far as flavors go. We chose the parmesan truffle fries this time, which were devoured in a hurry. The other options are original or sweet potato, and all are served with two types of homemade ketchup.  Be sure to save room for dessert here!!! This place has the most unique milkshakes ever! There are several different flavor combos of ice cream shakes topped with (wait for it)... pudding!!! My fave is the coffee shake topped with chocolate pudding, while my husband enjoys cookies n' cream with creme brûlée pudding. The pudding melts into the ice cream and creates the most unusual, yummy creation known to mankind. We go to Vegas often, and ALWAYS make a stop for one of these shakes. Try it once and you'll be addicted too!"}
{"text":"BurGR by Chef Gordon Ramsay was good, but not excellent.  It was a lot more simple than what I was expecting.  My friends and I visited during a recent trip to Vegas in late August - we had heard a lot about BurGR, so naturally we wanted to try it out.  It's a cool concept and I did like the decor - it's modern an interesting flame display out front.    The food was good, but really didn't wow me, especially since I've dined at a Chef Gordon Ramsay restaurant before and had been impressed by my previous experience.  I ordered a Hell's Kitchen burger, which came with guacamole, jalapeno-roasted peppers, melted cheese, and a sesame bun. It was surprisingly not that spicy.  We also ordered Truffle Parmesan Fries, which were surprisingly delicious.  They have some good cocktails too - I ordered a martini-type cocktail and it was sweet and good.   While my experience was a pretty good one at BurGR, I still wouldn't say I was super impressed, and I likely wouldn't visit again.  I'm curious to try Chef Gordon Ramsay's other restaurants instead."}
{"text":"4 stars because shake and sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had. SO DELICIOUS. But the food was just ok. I'll give 3 stars just for the food. I ordered chicken sliders and Bao buns. The bun for bao buns were dry although pork belly was soft and tasty.   You really should make reservations. I went to for lunch, I had to wait for 30-40 minutes. So I gambled, I lost few hundred dollars. Bad idea."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I would come here like all the time if I could! They are the best ever! Only once have I gone there and had something not amazing but it's okay the flavor was still there! The sweet potato fries are flawless. I have nothing but goodness to say. I try to bring all my family and friends who visit here. I just love it so much!"}
{"text":"Food: 4 Service: 4  I came in very open minded about this burger joint. While I love In-n-Out among other places in Vegas, paying $15 isn't for everyone. I went during restaurant week and I feel like the staff did a disservice by not telling us about the deals without me prompting them. I didn't hear them tell about the deals to other customers nearby either.  I had the chantrelle burger cooked medium. Great flavor with the mushrooms, figgy-onion jam, and the buttered bun. I had the just fries which I love steak fries, but couldn't finish them. And then part of the $20.13 restaurant week price was a sticky toffee push pop which was very good.   Solid restaurant in which I'd go back. As much as one wants to knock Gordon Ramsay, he does a pretty good job at his restaurants having been to Gordon Ramsay at the London in Manhattan and been knocked away by food and service."}
{"text":"There was an eclectic selection of burgers.  Unfortunately I can only remember 2 of our 3 burgers.  Hell's Kitchen and the Farmhouse burger, the Farmhouse was award winning.  The burgers are cooked to perfection.  It included a solid 1/2 pd burger, aged cheddar, 2 pieces of duck bacon topped off with a fried egg.  The burger was bliss in our mouths.  Hell's kitchen included a well roasted jalapeno paradise.    Burgers were great but what topped it off was the shakes.  They are technically in 3 tiers, flavored shake, different pudding and topped off with a flaky thin cookie.  We had 2 different shakes, a coffee shake that was amazing and a classic chocolate shake.  The chocolate shake came with caramel pudding which was perfection.    Burgers and shakes were both on the pricey end but you truly got what you paid for."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant about 15min ago and I will say overall, my experience was great. The line outside moves pretty quickly so, don't let that turn you away. They do a great job of managing the line by separating large groups and groups of 2. Obviously the groups of 2 line moves much faster. Our server Elijah was absolutely amazing and knowledgable. The jalapeño poppers are LIFE and so are the sweet potato fries (my best friend loved them and she HATES sweet potato fries). The only negative thing I can say about my experience is that my burger was overcooked. If I ordered the same thing from a chili's or Denny's and the burger arrived overcooked I would kind of expect it however, to go to a restaurant named burger buy a famous chef, I would expect \"medium\" to be just that. My best friend and I ordered our burgers exactly the same and hers was visibly pink inside (just like we like it) and mine was fully cooked (maybe even overly cooked). I think the overly cooked burger made the quality of the burger go down. There are a lot of ingredients and flavors to savor, all of which overpowered the meat itself. The manager came to our table and asked how things were going. My best friend informed him my food was not correct and he apologized and offered to bring another but by this time I was already halfway done with the other. He then offered to throw in a complimentary dessert to make up for the mistake the cooks made. (We got the pop up ice cream, pretty good!)    I would 100% go to burger again but, I might just double up on the jalapeño poppers or try a fish sandwich rather than getting an actual burger."}
{"text":"Went out for lunch here with my girlfriend and our two close friends. We were all super excited as we are all big fans of all things Gordon Ramsay. We all ordered a burger (of course) and attempted to share two sides of fries and some onion rings. As we took the first bites of our burgers we quickly knew that they were hands down the best we had ever eaten. The orders of fries were also outstanding and unique. Every bite was magical and I for one didn't want to stop eating when I was overly stuffed. I highly recommend this burger restaurant and look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we've visited Burgr, and the first thing I'll say is that the quality and the presentation of the food was consistent. I'll share the highlights of our experience:  Pros- The food is exceptional. The most basic ideas were turned to a very intricate piece of art you can taste. Who knew cod could taste so good? The burgers speak for themselves. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, with ornate decor. Presentation is well done also.  Cons-  Be prepared to wait a very long time. After ordering our food, we had a dragging 75 minutes before we got it. During which, a large group seated long after us received their order. Once it came, they didn't bring us an item we had ordered. We told the waiter, who never returned. When we mentioned it to someone else, they looked at the ticket and said that it looks like the person that took our order forgot to add them and that she'll get them for us. Even though we were halfway through our meal, they added that to our charge. We weren't very impressed about that part of our experience.  Even though the accuracy and proper time frame was a little lacking, they were friendly and helpful, and The food was phenomenal."}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night, they don't accept reservations but you can put your name in and they will text you when your table is ready. Or you can wait in line. Our wait was about an hour, but we played roulette until it was ready. The burgers were excellent and the truffle fried were to die for. I had the American burger, yummy! The husband had farm burger and loved it. Be aware the fries are a lot, you cane easily share them. The waiters were nice and the ombiance was casual and nice."}
{"text":"Went twice in the past month because this place serves a damn good burger and is an incredible value for Vegas.  The Hell's Kitchen burger is my favorite, but twice I've been with vegetarians and they were really happy with the Earth Burger.  My man liked the burger with duck and egg the best.  Jalapeno poppers are outstanding, but I would have been upset if I had gotten the really hot one.  And their milkshakes with pudding are incredible.  Truffle fries were whatever.  If you have a player's card (Total Rewards) for Planet Hollywood (or any of its sister casinos), most of the menu items are $1 off.  I like that a lot!  Also, if you have 3 or more in your group, you can give your info to the hostess and they'll text you when your table is ready.  That is awesome... so go gamble and get your free drinks while you wait!"}
{"text":"On FIRE! WOO!   I have the hell's kitchen theme song stuck in my head after eating here!  The restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood, and offers about eight gourmet specialty burgers! I never could imagine a burger getting this good. I even had it a day later and it was still amazing as left over food...   AMBIANCE: The restaurant is vivaciously colorful- with bright red, black decor. The restaurant is also quite large-. There is also a bar area. The restaurant offers a variety of its specialty cocktails as well as specialty beers from the bottle or tap. Definitely modern and up to date as it just opened middle of 2013 in July.  FOOD: Truffle Fries- The SAUCES- This definitely turns the dish from good to extraordinary!. The fries come in a cone shaped container and there is plenty for a few people to share. Chipotle ketchup and Curry Ketchup  Honey Pig Bao Buns- Great take on the Asian dish. The pork is well flavored and the bun provides a subtly sweet taste and soft texture that complements the pork and carrots. It comes with two buns to share!  Chanterelle Burger- It comes with Chanterelle Mushrooms, Arugula, and a thick juicy beef patty. There is also an onion fig jam which gives the burger its special flavor. I also customized it with a sunny side up egg. The yolk combo on the burger is awesome!  SERVICE: The service is impeccable. The waiters were attentive and helped serve us quickly and efficiently.  Coming back again! I may try this is a late night snack next time to cure my munchies!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious the service not so much. My husband ordered a hamburger fries and it was delivered to the person next to him who arrived  after we got there. They were very apologetic but I was a little disappointed  guess my expectations are a little higher for his restaurant. when it comes to customer service you could've given us dessert or  free soda but they didn't.and the quality of his furnishings poor maybe he needs to visit the site"}
{"text":"I had the hell burger which had a nice kick and very tasty. The onion rings were not as good as I thought, just ok, I would rather go with the regular or sweet potato fries next time. The strawberry milkshake was great! They have a cool bar area, very good and cool looking place. This place was super busy for a Tuesday! The only thing I would change is the onion rings for fries. The girls in the front and bar waiters were VERY nice and helpful with the menu.. The Hell is the top burger there and second is the Farm burger which i will try next time.This is located in Planet Hollywood Casino."}
{"text":"When I booked my recent trip to Las Vegas, I was I intrigued by the idea of eating at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. As a big fan of Ramsay, I've made it my goal to eat at ALL of his three restaurants while I'm in Vegas. Why not?!!     On my way to \"Vegas! The Show\" which was at Planet Hollywood as well, I saw the long line and I asked the hostess about the wait-time she said 45-60 minutes.  I was like Aw hell to the No! I wasn't going to waste my golden hour waiting time alongside the \"flame-effect wall!\" Ain't Nobody Got Time for That! I wasn't really hungry anyway, so I just went to the show on an empty stomach!   After the must-see-show! There was no line at all on that Thursday night and after 9pm, No line? Are you Kidding me? Yay for me! I'm gonna grab a burger!  I opted for more casual dining and sat at the sport bar with the overhead high-definition TVs and the loud blasting music, The bartender was great and the service was  outstanding, the decor is very interesting and hot, and the ambiance is lively and modern. I'd expect nothing less from Ramsey  I ordered a basic burger- American Burger!  Solid burger, made to my preference, with sweet lettuce, ripe tomato, fresh onion and sweet-bitter pickle with good american cheese on \"baked in-house\" bun, but it still wasn't memorable. I was expecting to be more impressed with one of a kind gourmet burger. Nothing to write home about!  Three Yelps!"}
{"text":"Food was great especially the chicken sliders...the price point as well as the service was perfect, strongly recommended"}
{"text":"It's was a pretty good burger but not worth the overall hype.   Definitely not worth the long wait I still feel bachi burger is better.   The fries were okay as well. But having to wait an hour to be seated and another hour to be served killed the experience."}
{"text":"Nästan 60 minuters väntan på dryck, ytterligare 30 minuter på maten som när den kom var kall tre burgare av fyra. Ytterligare 10 minuters väntan på nya burgare som sen inte ens var särskilt goda.  Restaurang med stort namn som dragplåster men medioker mat och service"}
{"text":"Soooo good. I love the iPad drink ordering but it would be cool if you could order everything from there. Food was so good I would drive 6 hours here just for a burger. Mmmm"}
{"text":"Im a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, and the burger definitely did justice. I ordered the Hells Kitchen first, which was delicious. Then next time I went in I ordered the American, also very good. Good prices I think for vegas!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live in Vegas and went here for the first time last month, and it was a big waste of money. This place is only successful because of where it is located and because it has a celebrity's name in the title. Portions are small, food is bland. I wouldn't recommended this place. Spend your hard earned money, on somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed . When you have a famous chefs name affiliated with a restaurant, you typically expect to be \"wowed\" by the food. Sadly, we were not. My husband's burger was mediocre to say the least and I couldn't even eat my chicken sliders or the under cooked onion rings. The only aspect that was worth mentioning in a positive light about this restaurant was the customer service. Our waitress was awesome! She tried to fix every disappointing aspect of our meal with kindness and attentiveness. Unfortunately, I would never go back and it definitely makes me wary about eating at any other Ramsey affiliated restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm the type of guy that loves to eat really good burgers. When I heard that celebrity-chef Gordon Ramsay was opening a hamburger joint on the strip, I was definitely interested; I wanted to see his unique take on the classic burger. Unfortunately, the hype of GR does not necessarily equate to great burgers.   I went on a Friday night with a good friend of mine. We were seated immediately and were introduced to our waitress. Hands down, the service here is really great. Funny, talkative, and helpful, the managers really hired some great people.  The menu has about seven or eight different burgers to choose from, each with their own unique toppings. The meat and buns of all of their burgers are all the same; so, you the only difference really is the cheese and the special condiments. I had the flame burger, which was pretty much a standard patty and bun with pepper-jack cheese and a jalapeño. Honestly, for 15 bucks, I was expecting more, patty is nothing to write home about, fries aren't included (and expensive... I paid 11 dollars for salty truffle fries), and it's just too expensive to justify the price.  If you're a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and his TV shows, then I'd guess I would recommend BurGR. If you're just looking for a great burger on the Vegas strip, I'd suggest going else where."}
{"text":"If this is NOT owning by Gordon, I'm fine with things I experienced in the restaurant several days ago since I'm not going back for sure.  Either he's not overseeing this location as \"Gordon Ramsey\" or he's gotten a double standards here.  First of all, the table mats smelled so terrible.  As soon as be seated, some kind of pee, sweat or some kinds of BO gushing out to my nose from time to time. I checked my hands, scarf, clothes, shoes, and my chair, the table then my surroundings. Soon I realized it was from the mat.  Not sure what it's made with.  The bottom line is, as a restaurant experts, one should equip sense of beauty, great smell & taste and overall atmosphere...   Unbelievable thing was that the fries served with store flyer!  The flyer was an ink-printed \"black\" paper; the ink is not eatable. The worse part is that both paper and ink may contains with lead and some banned materials.    Last, we ordered 3 well-done beef burgers.  They came so dried.  I wonder the chefs know what's going on.  I know making a well-done beef burger is not an easy thing.  But this is Gordon's restaurant after all.     I love Gordon's shows and have watched countless episodes of Hell Kitchen and his shows.  He's was so picky that he would not compromise anything happening in kitchen for the best serving his customers.  I did NOT see anything in this restaurant near his standards except of price. However, I have to give its waiters and waitress some credits cause they seem quite happy working their..."}
{"text":"I can't wait to go back to Las Vegas and eat here again. I love the place. I did not have to wait at all despite a long line. The food was absolutely phenomenal. Selection of drinks was great. I love their iPad drink menu! Service was top notch. 5 stars all the way. Good job Chef Ramsey!"}
{"text":"I will be dreaming of the food until I come back.   Yuuum. The line to get in is intimidating. I'm not going to lie. I questioned whether or not we should wait an hour that was quoted to the people in front of us. BUT THERE IS A TRICK. Parties of two are sat VERY quickly.  We waited in line for max 20 minutes. They have tons of two person seating areas and minimal larger group tables.   Now for the good stuff. Our waiter, Christian was ON IT. He suggested the Hell's Kitchen burger and truffle fries. Ordered both plus the Yardbird burger. Everything was sensational.  I ate the Yardbird. The chicken was THE GREATEST I have ever had. So soft and easy to bite into. The sauce on the burger was out of control, the bun was perfectly crisp, and everything was just on point.  Truffle fries were AH-MAY-ZING. Real potatoes that were soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. The truffle aioli was so good, I could put that on everything.  We would have had dessert but I was about to burst from fullness. We will be back every time we go to Vegas.   Paid about $50 for two people. First got there at 9pm. Left at about 11:30pm. Pretty good pricing and meal timing for Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 8 people. The wait was about an hour... but that's to be expected. Got the farm burger, and honestly, I wasn't too wowed. Maybe my taste buds aren't refined enough for these gourmet burgers, but I didn't see the appeal of it or the fries. We got all three different kinds of french fries and none of them seemed to be worth the price.   Overall, if you're a simple eater like me, don't dine here."}
{"text":"Burgers are all good. Stay away from fish sandwich. Parmigiana truffle oil fries we shared with 4 people. Expensive for burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Get the farm burger! This place is one of the best burger places in Vegas and I'm a local. The line to wait for a table can be long but goes by fairly quickly. Try the truffle fries too!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place so that's why it gets a 3. Ordered the Caesar salad which sounded interesting but the apples seemed like an after thought, just a little topping to a mediocre overly dressed pile of lettuce. I got the American burger which was really juicy and delicious and bf got the Hell's Kitchen which he loved. It definitely has a big kick, if you don't like spice you won't like that! Service was super slow but we were watching tennis anyway so no big deal. It's decent and better than eating lunch at a bar where everyone is getting drunk so 3 stars, served its purpose for what we needed."}
{"text":"Everything about this place reeks of Vegas: hot chics waitresses who show off their pretty young boobs, pretty boy waiters who chat and flirt with their fellow employees as the food in the kitchen sits, and waits....and waits.....and waits to be served.   Ok, I ordered an American burger medium rare with fries and a beer. I was placed up front by the kitchen and could watch the dudes in the back making the orders. The food looked and smelled great! Alright, I was excited and ready to eat!  But the orders, after being made, just sat there where the cooks placed the food. So many plates would fill up the area that they ran out of room to place them there; they'd start to shuffle the plates around to any available area.  I got my 'burgr' and it was of good quality, but it was cold and not very appetizing. I told the airhead, pleasantly busty boobed waitress and all she could say was, \"Um, ok. But its good, right? I mean, its cold, but its good, right?\" Replying that it was cold and not what I wanted from a 'burgr', she told me that I had ordered it medium rare and maybe that's why it was cold. Hmmm........I gave up and tried the manager.  Long story short, I chewed her out and got another 'Burgr' that was good, but after all the hassle I had to go through to get a decent meal I say screw this overhyped, inefficiently ran celebrity chef dumphole.  AND, after this experience, I decided not to try any more Gordon Ramsay restaurants during my trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"First of all, I admire how Gordan Ramsay has made his brand accessible to people who are curious but don't want to pay $$$$ for an experience. I honestly think only my burger was truly exceptional (the hog one -- $18) and you do still pay a pretty penny. It's about $10-$14 for fries and the burgers are at least $15. There's a great variety. I liked the bun.   I'd definitely recommend the onion rings. Shakes are tasty too but way overpriced ($9!!). I think the ones from Sonic are just as good and like 1/3 the price.   Our service was good. There's a wide selection of beer and the dining room was really cool (esp the fire sign!!)"}
{"text":"Don't know where to start... I hate to give a bad review because we are huge Ramsey fans!  They sat my wife and I down at a table and as we waited for a waiter (about 5 mins and place was not busy at the time) we saw about 5 waiters at the cashier area ( 1 table down from us) just talking amongst themselves... At this point, another table was seated right behind us, and the waiter went to serve them before us... Really rude! I was beyond furious!!!! About three mins later, a waiter decided to show up.. She proceeded to take our drink and food orders..  It took about 30-40 mins to get a damn burger! Ridiculous! Let's keep in mind, the restaurant was not busy just yet.   We finally got our food and it was 6/10.. The fries were good but the burger was just ok...  Soo sad to give this a bad review! We tried all of Gordon's restaurant in Vegas and this by far was the most disappointing! I think I was most disappointed with the serves than the food! I can't believe 5 people just watch us get seated at a table and proceeded to continue their chit chats rather than welcoming us to the restaurant..  Won't come here again but we will go back to Ramsey's steakhouse and Ramsey's Pub."}
{"text":"Came here at night after we had gone to dayclub.. The wait was an hour and a half long! But we still stayed. There was a mishap with our name not being written down, but the hostess was nice enough to put us down for the amount of time we had left, it was still a good half hour still. The big fiery sign was definitely eye catching.  Service was alright, a lot of servers but being so busy, it was ridiculously hard to get our server when we needed them.  My boyfriend and I ordered: - Creme brûlée Oreo milkshake: loved the creme brûlée on top, speckled with vanilla beans, but it was too thick to mix in with the creamier Oreo Shake at the bottom.   - Truffle Parmesan fries: wasn't a huge fan of the steak fries, we prefer skinny fries.. But that truffle aioli though, with bits of what seems to be mushrooms, loved the fragrance of the truffle.    - Chanterelle burger: burger was cooked to a medium rare, added fontina cheese so it a great addition. The saltiness of the mushrooms paired well with the arugula and sweet onion jam. Not a huge fan of sesame seed bun, but if it works, it works...  - Euro burger: my bf loved this! He literally inhaled the burger before I could blink.. He especially loved the goat cheese in it, which surprised me, cause he usually doesn't like that pungent smell of the cheese. And the truffle aioli was a plus. The aroma of the truffle was so enticing.  As hungover as we were from dayclub, we enjoyed every bite, even though I could only eat like half, definitely can tell the quality of the burgers. But expect a ridiculous wait... An hour plus, but on the plus side, being at planet Hollywood, you can always get some gambling in or grab a drink while you wait!"}
{"text":"Very good Hamburgers. I give it only  3 stars because the design of the restaurant is just ok, the service was worse than the American restaurant medium and we wait nearly thirty minutes our food and it was not crowd. I recommend  to visit the place instead of the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was very disappointed.   The wait about an hour long, so we walked around Planet Hollywood. I waited to receive a text, but realized that they never sent me the \"we have your number and this is how long you wait\" text, so we had to go back and re-enter our names and number AGAIN.   After sitting down, I was impressed with how high the tables were, reaching closer for an eye catching view of your food experience! I start think the \"wait was worth it. That this place was gonna be the best burger.\" My friends had brought us there and had bragged about the wings there. The wings were pretty good, so we were all pretty excited for the main course.  My friend and I shared the sweet potato fries. I was very upset to find them tasting like any other sweet potato fries. Nothing was special about them, except the sauce. I was also very disappointed with my burger. I ordered the Britannia Burger. It was pretty simple and the mango chutney had no kick. Wish I ordered what my friend ordered (the hot dog). My friend's hot dog looked a lot better.   Also saw someone's fries sitting for a long time. Our's weren't the warmest, either. We were only in Vegas for a night and was pretty upset with wasting it at this place."}
{"text":"So being a Ramsey restaurant I can't even believe this is my review....MY BURGER WAS RAW AND HAD NO SEASONING......I got the cheeseburger not knowing it was just bun, cheese and meat...NOTHING Else. They very nicely remade me a new one but really!!!!! The pork belly turn overs again needed seasoning... The milkshake was nice...For the price,I wanted a delicious burger, not a was an ok burger I guess.... Very disappointing. Trying the steak house tonight better be way better than here."}
{"text":"Adorei o Shake. Meu filho pediu um hambúrguer estava delicioso. Os chileno winds apimentados e deliciosos. Atendimento muito bom. Não é um lugar para quem gosta de tranquilidade, mas típico lugar fast-food food. Recomendo."}
{"text":"It was my first time here. There was a wait of about 10-15 minutes, but it was a Sunday brunch time at the strip, it's really not that bad. We were actually going to go to Bobby's Burger Palace, but since I have never tried this place, we gave it a try. When we reached the hostess, we were seated right away- although it took a little to get through the line. Then, the server arrived and left us with a tablet to look at the drink menu. Nothing special from the menu, but unlike other places where they are offering different kinds, such as rotating handle and pumpkin shandy, they were still offering grapefruit shandy. We got two of those and waters, however, they did not came to our table until our fries came out. Then, we had to ask for our waters to remind our waitress. When she came with our drinks,  she seemed very dangerous and ended up smashing a glass on the table. THAT IS TOTALLY FINE. Things happen. She apologized and we were fine with it. The service was still good.   We ordered truffle fries-since I love truffle, and Hell's kitchen burger and Brittnia burger. The fries came out pretty fast but the burgers took awhile.   Overall, I just did not get the impression that this place is that good and deserves such good rating since their burgers were a bit drier that what I expected. I actually expected the patties to be jucier since they were all about the certified angus and whatsoever. Yes, they were above average burgers but not to be under Gordon Ramsay's name. The fries were a bit too dalty and lacked in truffle scent and flavor.   They definitely have room for improvement, yet Vegas offers too many options for food.   PS) Waitress was so kind she offered us two comp pushpops :)"}
{"text":"The place looks amazing !!!! I love chef Ramsay and I seen all his shows !!!! Writing this review is difficult but I was disappointed  with the restaurant !!! My husbands burger was undercooked \"he requested well done\" also they forgot to add mayo considering he requested mayo. They took forever almost 35 mins to bring our food!!!! Not only that even though our server was nice she gave us a refill after we were done eating, pretty much we were choking during our lunch!!! The fact that the burger was undercooked made my husband feel sick he hates seeing the blood in the burger and that pretty much was it for him !!! After they fix their mistake my husband was upset he expected the best from this restaurant since I bragged about how great chef Ramsay is !!!! We paid $60 bucks for two burgess, a shake, and tea to over price for the service I have to say I am disappointed  I expected the best from the name Chef Ramsay !!!!"}
{"text":"Euro burger was amazing! I'm obsessed with Gordon Ramsay so I was expecting nothing less than great, and they delivered. Most people talk about the Hells Kitchen burger but I think the Euro burger was much tastier and cheesier, so delicious! Truffle Parmesan fries with the aioli dipping sauce and homemade ketchup, amazing!"}
{"text":"One of the better quality burgers I have had. I probably would have rated it 5-stars if the cost and the wait were not a little steep. I can only complain so much though because it is a Gordon Ramsay establishment. If you are looking for a Gordon Ramsay restaurant to visit and not wanting to have to pay for a more expensive meal, then this is your place."}
{"text":"It's RAW! Apps amazing, chicken salad was delicious however meat was uncooked. Waiter unfortunately didn't make any attempt to remedy the situation. I"}
{"text":"Im not a veggie person but took a bite of my friend's Earth Burger and it was awesome!!! Highly recommend to even meat lovers. Its uniquely tasteful and refreshing.. I had Hell's Kitchen Burger and that was scrumptious, too; but if I come back I'll get Earth Burger. Love this place!!! Wait is long but worth it while you're visiting Vegas.. I would never wait 25-40mins at a local restaurant but hey, we're in Vegas so Id rather wait a lil and try something new & more importantly good!"}
{"text":"Supremely disappointed. The waiter forgot our order and we ended up waiting over 45 minutes for our food. Then, they forgot our fries. My boyfriend and I spent the next day hunched over the toilet trying to keep food down."}
{"text":"Just because you're a super fancy pants Michelin star Chef Gordon Ramsay doesn't mean you get a license to misspell words.  It's definitely not the British way of spelling the word either..  You're an artist of the grain, not the spoken word! ;)  And why is the \"GR\" capitalized?  Is it an homage to Chef Ramsay's infamous bear-like growls at his employees?    Anyways...  The menu shows the prices on the left side for \"non-rewards members,\" and the right side was for \"rewards members.\"  Why such blatant cross-marketing?  Isn't it enough that we're already in a casino?  All you end up doing is making me feel like I was in elementary school again--left out of the Cool Kids' Club.  Sad face. :(  All the cool kids get $1 off their burgers and I don't..  Feeling guilty about my gluttonous gorging earlier on my Vegas 'Ventures, I compromised with myself by getting the Earth Burger.   The Earth Burger was...Earthly.  The grilled portobello mushroom tasted like a grilled portobello mushroom.  For non-meat options, the goal is to disguise the taste of it right?  Mission not accomplished.  My friend and I also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  One \"first world complaint/spoiled people problems\" I have is that the way the truffle fries is served, it's displayed so that it's easier for one person to eat by themselves rather than for two to share.  Sharing is caring?  The fries were also kind of greasy, especially by the time you get to the bottom.  They were also varied in shape, so they weren't really uniform in terms of softness/mushiness/oiliness.    Considering your alternatives in Las Vegas, I would say skip this one."}
{"text":"Burgers were ok, not much seasoning the truffle fries were very greasy but the jalapeño poppers were pretty good. The hostesses dresses We're unflattering & a complete eyesore. Be prepared to wait AT LEAST 30 Minutes."}
{"text":"Let me get straight to the point on this one...  Service was great... blue cheese burger was awesome; perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. Jalapeño poppers were spicy, served hot, with creative plating. Farro-quinoa chicken salad, was seriously the best salad I've ever ate. I'd go back just for one of those bad boys. It was refreshing, had a nice crunch with a tang of feta cheese and an amazing dressing...salad that was light but also filling.  Chicken sliders seemed undercooked/pink when I cut into it;  mentioned it to server, and he stated it was because of the marinade but I was a little skeptical so they took it off the tab and offered to make a new one. They were seriously so nice and accommodating but we were already pretty full with the rest so we politely declined. We finished with dessert by ordering a Creme Brule -oreo shake, which was also tasty, rich and thick. Literally, the only complaint I have is that the girls uniforms are so tacky and short. So short you see the girls' glutes hanging out on some of them. I don't know why it bothered me so much because im not a conservative person nor a feminist. I guess because the establishment is owned by THE Gordon Ramsey and I expected more professional attire? I'm not sure... well it IS vegas and all, so it shouldn't drive me crazy but it really did. It was seriously distracting...if I were one of them I'd be super self conscience because it's kind of a family restaurant. I don't know, maybe I just hate the cut, color and design of its entirety, but I really do loathe them. Anyway, yes go here, its delicious and I'm certain you won't find anything you won't like (besides the uniforms)."}
{"text":"I expected more from Gordon Ramsay. The BurgR did not impress me. I came here since it has his name all over it. So far the best burger I've found is Del Frisco's Grill. I even prefer Shake Shack.   I don't see how this place would make it without Gordon's name."}
{"text":"Came here today for the first time. It was literally a 5 minute wait in line. The servers were really friendly and honestly I enjoyed the food! I will have to say that be careful in ordering multiple appetizers as they get you full so quickly before the actual burger! I got the Hell's Kitchen Burgr and had mushrooms and bacon added. They are a $3 charge each so be careful when you agree when asked if you want it ;) I didn't mind though! Anyways I like the detail in presentation of the food and everything around. They keep the place clean too! The patty was definitely not frozen as another yelped mentioned...trust me you can tell the difference. It was delicious! But anyways I had a good experience and I'm sure you will too (:"}
{"text":"Dined here while on vacation in Vegas. The hostesses were probably some of the worst I've experienced outside of LA (where they can be snotty and rude). I expect some acknowledgement when standing directly in front of the hostess stand. (Call me crazy)  The burger was average. The server was really good and did a great job refilling drinks, etc, but the initial experience with the hostesses tainted my opinion of the place. I wanted to love this place more than I actually did."}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Like really, really bad. Not one person near my table was blown away by any of the food. The look on everyone's face was hilarious because it said \"REALLY!? This is what I waited for?\" Very, very overpriced too.   I have tried to go here 3 times and this is the first time I have actually been able to try the food. The other two the wait was way too long and now I know it is not worth it by any means.  Meat is undercooked and is so pink you might think it is raw. The burger itself is really underwhelming and very disappointing. It lacks flavor and you will be wondering why you bothered to wait for so long in line and after you ordered. It is shocking how mediocre it is.  The pop up dessert should have been great but instead tastes like a discount ice cream you buy from the clearance section at a convenience store.  Such a lousy experience. I actually would like my money back. I don't see this place lasting for long. It can't survive on tourist only who don't know there are much better burger places nearby on the strip and off it."}
{"text":"Best burgur of my life.  I was so excited to eat here and it lived up to every expectation.  I'm so happy I was able to go here on my trip.  The quality of everything was so good.  The sweet potato fries and truffle oil fries are a must.  Hells kitchen burger was so good roasted tomatoes and jalapeños and avocado.  So good!  It's definitely a must if in Vegas."}
{"text":"Terrifical experience!  The staff was on point, drink refills just on time, and very friendly!! Being a non-meat eater, going to a burger joint is probably not ideal, but they were accomodating and suggested a DELICIOUS alternative...a portobello mushroom burger! And those fries are reedick! I would definitely go back if I wasn't watching my lady lumps!  Good times, high energy atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Had their farmer burger and it's so so so good it melts in your mouth!!! Definitely coming back here"}
{"text":"The wait was like an hour long. This place was packed. The good thing about it was that they'll text you when your table is ready. So you can walk around the Miracle Mile shops until your table is ready.  After finally getting a seat, I really liked the design of the place. The tables were all set up really nicely (the two seaters all in the middle). Gordon Ramsey's picture on the wall though was kind of over the top (at least that's what I thought). No need to promote yourself, we're already in your restaurant. Promote the food.  I don't remember what burger I got, but it was pretty good. I remember I kept thinking so that's what a \"gourmet\" burger looks like and taste like. It was a bit pricey but not too much. We also ordered fries. Please note you can order 1 fries for 2 people as 1 order will be enough. It comes with 2 dipping sauces I believe.  When I'm in Vegas and I'm not eating at one of the buffets, I'd probably come eat here again."}
{"text":"It takes 45 minutes to get in because the service sucks.  The food is over priced and really not what I expected.  Probable will not go back."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite burger joint.   The Hell's Kitchen burger is so good. Just the right combination of peppers avocado, bun.   Large selection of draft beers.   They go out of their way to ensure you have a great experience.    Totally recommendable if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Alright here it goes. I LOVE Gordon Ramsay! But I didn't quite enjoy my Burg experience or food. :-/   We waited about 40 min for a table and got seated near the grill. Once we looked over the menu, I noticed they only had one veggie burger. And it was one of those huge mushroom cap ones. I HATE MUSHROOM. but I ordered it anyway because I figured that I just  waited for forty minutes and I want a damn burger. We ordered drinks and they came by at a decent time. Our burgers though took longer. But I figured they're making them extra tasty.   I also ordered truffle fries with my burger, an extra $8 bucks for those. When we got our food it was visually appealing and delicious. But one bite out of mine and I was grossed out. No matter how fancy it looked, all I tasted was mushroom. Bleh! So I ate truffle fries. Which tasted ok.   I'm not about that fancy life and after this expensive and half eaten meal, I would probably not give it another chance. Give me Red Robin over fancy schmancy burgers anytime.   Still love you Gordon Ramsay but please add some other burgers for non-meat eaters. We do exist!"}
{"text":"We were there late like 9 pm. Despite the fact that we already had dinner, I just had to try it. Waited about an hour and i ordered the flagship burger, told the server that my wife will just have fries and some drink.   I noticed that some ppl around us were sharing the burger served in halfs. Mine came like that too. Ok, although i don't like burgers cut in half, fine, it was a tolerable mistake. But it was over cooked! Was more like well done instead of medium which i have ordered. Being late, i did not recall it and ate it.   What bothers me is this.... how could have they cut the burger in half and seen that it was over cooked, still bring it out to the table?"}
{"text":"OMG! This place was DELICIOUS. I was scared away every time I wanted to try this place because the wait was always an hour plus but I understand why now.  I tried the Farm burger and it was just great. The meat was cooked perfectly and the duck bacon wrapped everything together. Yum!  We also tried the truffle fries which were delicious and so flavorful. The house made ketchup and truffle sauce bind the fries together perfectly.   The only disappointment was the Jalapeno 'Rita'. It was way too spicy and harsh.  I was amazed on how delicious the food was. This is definitely a place to go every time you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very overrated.  We waited 40 mins for bells kitchen burger and a chicken sandwich.  Both were only okay.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Came here with the family that was in town.  Very steep prices, but really no different than anything else on the strip.   Started with some apps.  Onion rings, jalapeño poppers, and the wings.  Loved the wings, very good sauces, liked the lollipop.   The onion rings were some of the best I have had.  Battered to order, great taste. Poppers were good also, great cheddar dipping sauce.  I thought there was a little too much breading on them though.   Everybody ordered a burger, one person ordered the 5 spice breaded chicken sliders.  Lets start with the sliders, phenomenal!   The breading was perfect and very flavorful, even better than the burgers.  I ordered the farm burger with the egg and duck breast bacon.  Egg on a burger is always a good option, but I felt the bacon was lost, really didn't add anything.  The other three also ordered burgers, they all really enjoyed them.   We also ordered some sides.  The sweet potato fries were very good, and we also ordered the regular fries.  Regular fries were good, but greasy.  There was a pool of grease at the bottom of the cone that seeped onto the table.   Our meal was great, we will be back.  My only complaint, three of the burgers were overcooked.  Mine was the only one that wasn't.  We did nothing about it because they were so good."}
{"text":"I don't know why some of my fellow yelpers and friends don't like this place. To me, it's burger heaven! Perhaps the mistake is the order combination; however, my first experience was total perfection.  Located just inside Planet Hollywood, and trust me you won't miss it unlike Earl's Sandwich (I always have trouble finding that place).  The Jalapeno Poppers and Truffle Parmesan Fries were mind blowing delicious grubs! You must at least order these if you've avoided being a carnivore.  The burger: well................ just perfect. The end.  Ambiance 4.8 Flavor 5 Presentation 5 Service 4.5 Price 4.5  Grade: 4.76"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW. Absolutely amazing food. I went to Vegas for my 21st birthday this past weekend and may I say one of the highlights of my trip was this place! Must try the jalapeno poppers and creme brulee milkshake. I would advise to *not* play it safe with the burgers and to try the many different options rather than ordering the American burger (because the others are so so good). I will definitely come back to this place!   On top of the great food, the service was fantastic. Two of the waiters, Sergio and Eric were absolutely amazing and kind! They really made my day with their vibrant personalities and charm."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay BurGr was an enlightening experience. I don't watch too many of his shows so I wasn't sure what to expect food-wise. However, I did pick up on all of the hype due to the sheer fact that every time we walked past the restaurant the line was around the corner.   The ambiance at the restaurant was great. The theme made sense. Flames every where (real fire in the glass), a lot of spicy items on the menu, the whole Hell's Kitchen thing - I get it. Food-wise, it took me a few bites to really understand the target audience. It's catering to a demographic who watches his shows, but probably doesn't eat at a lot of foodie restaurants. One clue was that his face was plastered over everything for the branding connection. Once I figured that out it all came together and it wasn't a bad meal. It just wasn't as great of a meal as the line had hyped it up to be.  We ordered the honey-pig bao buns to start. They were okay. There was a lot of hoisin sauce and the pork was a bit lost beneath it.   I was a bit surprised that the burgers were not grass-fed beef. Now, I don't mind corn-fed beef at all (I am American, I did grow up on that beef flavor). However,  knowing that Gordon Ramsay is British and known for fine dining, it was just strange that the beef wasn't grass fed. Another clue that BurGR is not necessarily for the foodies.   I got the Euro burger, which was also okay, but I couldn't really taste the truffle. My friends got the Uber burger and the Blue burger - both said theirs were okay, but also not overly flavorful.  We split the truffle fries, which came with a curry ketchup and truffle aioli. The curry ketchup was probably the best item we had all day. We weren't really sold on the truffle aioli... it seemed to be missing the truffle. We had eaten the night before at Gordon Ramsay Pub in Caesar's Palace and had a completely different and quite amazing truffle aioli. Literally, we were trying to lick the container because it was that vibrant with truffle. So I'm not sure why BurGR's was so bland. I'm glad I had that experience at Gordon Ramsay Pub first with a much more elevated level of food otherwise I may have been a bit more disappointed in my BurGR meal and Gordon Ramsay as a whole.  All in all, Gordon Ramsay BurGR was an average meal aimed at the masses."}
{"text":"Service was horrible,  employees were huddled around not attending to those of us who were waiting for service. Took an hour to get 3 burgers with again staff huddled just talking. Food finally came out, fries must have been cooked in the morning as we were there at midnight. Worst fries ever. For a celebrity to put his name on this, I'm sure he would not be happy with his wait staff, buyers beware, do not spend your money here."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday and we absolutely loved it. The wait wasn't too bad to be seated. Service was excellent. Food was delicious and came out fairly quickly. Would definitely return and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome burgers. I'm not much of a burger person, but I really liked this place.  We had the truffle fries, the farm burger, and the chili dog.   I had read that the chili dog as noteworthy here, so even though I would ordinarily never get it, I gave it a shot. It was good, but there was nothing memorable about it other than the size.  The farm burger was just excellent. It was very well thought out and balanced. The meat was cooked perfectly. There is not much to say other than it was perfection. The truffle fries were savory and delicious and the portion size was healthy. Skip the buffets and stop in to GR BurGR for a bite. You will be glad you did. PS - I loved the uniforms here!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we waited in line to eat lunch here. So worth it!!!  My boyfriend and I ordered the jalapeño poppers as an appetizer. Man! These are so good!!! You get a yummy amount for $12.  Next we ordered the gooey fries. Again... seriously worth it! They were exactly as named... gooey with goodness!  My boyfriend ordered the Hells Kitchen burger and I ordered the Euro burger. Not gonna lie, I liked mine more! His was good and hit you with some good basic flavors of a traditional burger but had an added kick with the jalapeño in it. Mine was covered in flavor (more than his in my opinion). The goat cheese is an awesome flavor addition. Nice and fresh ingredients in everything.  The staff was also super sweet and friendly. Even had the manager come out and greet everyone which was a nice touch.   Our total bill was around $60-65 I believe, but we definitely got our money's worth. I'd absolutely return and recommend it. It's all totally worth it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for a date night and wanted to try Burgr. We didn't wait very long for a table, as it was around 10pm and there was no line. The hostess showed us to a two top, too small table, so I opted for the booth that was being resetted by a busser. I don't like to play musical chairs but, I asked very nicely. She said that we could take that booth. The server came over to our table and greeted us with their drink menu. We both ordered a drink. We shared two apps--the chicken wings and hummus. Shared one Farm burger and some truffle fries and the butterscotch milkshake. The food was good! No complaints about the food.   My review is more towards the service. First of all, why aren't the runners have their hair pulled back? I also noticed that there were about 5-6 tables that needed to be bussed and cleaned, but instead all of the bussers were just chilling there at the micros computer station. I also noticed that there was a server dude that was chewing gum. How tacky! Also saw another server who was eating as well on the floor. Another employee was sitting on the booth, trying to \"fix\" his shoes or something. Our server was nice, however her hair needs to be well kept. She was also on her cell phone.   These employees need more training. Seems like they don't give a shit on where they're working. The manager looked like he doesn't give a shit either."}
{"text":"Wow, just great burgers. We stopped in for lunch, got seated inside 10 minutes, and our order was taken right away. My wife and son both ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, the roasted tomatoes on it made the taste. I had the Hogs burger which was great too. We shared a Caesar salad in the side, slices of apple and a nice dressing made it a great side. Our waiter Greg was really helpful, got our order in quick and our check right away as we had time constraints. Would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"Il faut savoir être patient pour goûter au burgers revisités par un Chef. Et aussi ne pas avoir peur des notes pouvant être un peu salée. Et aussi manger dans une ambiance un peu bruyante... Mais malgré tout ces points, les Burgers étaient succulent! Les frites a la truffe et parmesan aussi! Mais attention, une seule portion pour 2, largement suffisant!!"}
{"text":"not too long waiting cause was 5pm, as soon as we seated our waiter, already busy with another table told us he would have take care of us in just a minute and he did! Matt was his name I think.. very knowledgeable, energetic and gave us good explanation and suggestions about the menu.. we took onion rings (I`m not a cheese lover but the parmigiano on top was a very good quality (I`m Italian so I know how a good parmigiano taste).. Burger???? I LOVED IT and finish in a second! Chanterelles mushroom were really fresh and the onion-fig jam gave that sweetness that made it delicious. and the additional breast duck bacon was a good choice.. Even the cocktails worth it a try.. A 6 stars place!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an example to show the power of advertising can it twist your mind. The waiting time was 1:45 min, during which it took almost 20 min to clean the table. We tried 2 types of burgers and both was normal if not less. Nothing special about the meat, no difference between the well done and medium! And the reply was 'its made to your order'. The only thing I liked was the fries dipping. Dont waste your time and money..."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Best burgers and the BEST onion rings I've ever had. An absolute must do when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"OMG, so yummy.... lol We got reg cheeseburgers, they were cooked perfectly, one order of steak fries which were plenty for us. we will definitely return next time i'm in vegas. ; )"}
{"text":"Three words: Southern. Yardbird. Burger.  If you go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR (and you will), this item has to be one you consider trying. Now, I know the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the American Burger are popular items; but listen to me: you see that photo I posted of that Southern Yardbird Burger? That could be YOU.  With that out of the way, Gordon Ramsay BurGR was enjoyable overall. My crew knew that there was going to be a wait in order to seated; we got to the restaurant around 5 on a Friday. Once we got the text message that seating was available, it was on. I can't remember exactly who our waiter was, but he was on point the entire time; made sure drinks were filled, provided great recommendations, and provided that Las Vegas hospitality to some folks coming from the East Coast.  I can definitely see why this place stays packed: good food + good drinks + good service + friendly atmosphere = satisfied and returning customers. I will be back here once I come back to LV.  Oh yeah, before I forget: Southern. Yardbird. Burger."}
{"text":"EuroBurgr, one of THE best burgers I've had in my life!!! Delicious. Get it medium rare, if not, you don't understand food. But try! Pink beef is good."}
{"text":"This place is a must every time I visit Vegas. The food is exceptional, and somehow, the service manages to exceed that."}
{"text":"SHORT VERSION: We will definitely be back.   LONG VERSION: We had what was called a Farm Burger. It had an over easy egg on it, sharp cheddar cheese, and duck bacon. The bun was homemade and fresh with both black and regular sesame seeds. Ordered cooked to medium. The burger was so good. Rich and delicious and hit the spot. I bet I'll crave that burger and end up back here again next trip. Jalapeño poppers were a little spicy for my palate but the ranch type sauce they were in was delish'. Parmesan truffle fries were good but I could take them or leave them. We'll try either the onion rings or sweet potato fries next time. I've heard other Yelpers say the onion rings are amazing. We shared the burger along with the poppers and fries and still left a ton of fries and 2 poppers on the table. We finished the burger. :)  To add, we ate at 5:30pm on a Thursday; table for two. The wait was only about ten minutes. Our waiter was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The food and drinks are delicious. I personally would recommend getting the popcorn as an appetizer . It was made to perfection!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal, my favorite place in Vegas!. It's a must for any foodie or Ramsay fan. The food and the service is always top notch and the prices are very reasonable!   If your coming to Vegas don't miss out!!!!"}
{"text":"Since this area is tourist trap central, I had my doubts about trying this place. I don't even watch his show so I wasn't at all excited as my brother in law when he convinced me to go.    Since there were only 2 of us, we were able to get seated pretty quickly. The waitress done a great job of describing the items that she was recommending. We ended up getting some beers, fries and burgers.   I was thinking there is no way a burger could be worth $14. I was wrong. This burger was delicious and different from anything I've ever tried. It may not be worth $14 but it's worth trying at least once.   Service was awesome!"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to spots in Las Vegas. There's usually a bit of a wait so I suggest coming at random times like 3-4pm. We waited about 20 minutes for a party of three. The food here is full of flavor, but they're also busy so waiting for the food felt like a lifetime. I ordered the Farm Burger ($15) and have also tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($15). Both are tasty and definitely fills you up even if it doesn't seem like it. If you're not feeling a burger, their hot dogs are huge and delicious too! The buns for both are thick but have a nice texture sprinkled with sesame on them. But to get to the point, the best thing here is THE TRUFFLE FRIES ($11). Maybe I'm biased for truffle fries, but the ones at Burgr are absolutely splendid and done with perfection. The Parmesan, garlic, truffle, cheesiness is so strong and they really top a chunk of it on there. I'm literally licking everything off the paper at the end of the meal. It's heavenly and a must order!"}
{"text":"I eat a lot of burgers. This is because I love them, and Southern California continues to crank out one boutique burger joint after the other. That last part is relevant because if you live in an area with a high concentration of good burger options, chances are you won't be overly impressed with Ramsay's Burgr. That isn't to say this is bad, or even mediocre, but it isn't providing something I haven't had already.   For one thing, the lengthy line out front is barely justified. I had to wait over 30 minutes just to get a seat for a burger. I know it's all because of whose burger it is, still sucked.   I started off with the truffle fries, which come with a garlic aioli and a fancy house ketchup. They were delicious, especially with the aioli. I wasn't too hot on the ketchup. To me, ketchup is one of those condiments that shouldn't be messed with too much. I don't use it often, but when I do I expect the flavor to be consistent.   The blue burger seemed to be their standard offering, so I went with that. It's very simple, which allows for the meat to do most of the talking. It told me that it's tender and succulent and juicy, so I devoured it. The toppings only consisted of a little arugula and some blue cheese. The bun was excellent, some kind of seed-y, doughy bread. Could've done with a bit of a toasting on the inside, but that's only a minor complaint.   Pricing was in line with what you'd expect at a \"luxury\" burger spot.  It's certainly worth stopping in if you're in town, but maybe not for repeat visits. Not with that line, at least."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Ramsay, his persona and his cooking.  BurGR seemed like a cool place in concept, look and feel and with so many rave reviews, the expectations were probably tough to match.  Look for an updated review in the near future but my first experience at least in tastebuds has been 'okay'.    When you get there, you're usually first greeted by a massive line if you're coming in during the peak rush hours.  Luckily, that line moves by pretty quick and the hostesses usually come around looking for specific party numbers to get everyone moving.  I got to sit in the counter area where the action was happening.  The decor was pretty cool as well with a fiery front piece and the staff were nice enough.    They have a nice drink menu on an iPad (curious if these iPads are on the tables as we had to ask for the iPad at the counter) and a good selection.  The menu itself consists of burgers, sandwiches, appetizers and some desserts.  I debated between the farm burger and the Chanterelle burger and ended up with the farm since so many Yelpers were happy with it.  I also got some regular fries and an ale on draft.    The fries were pretty good - full potato slices so they were pretty thick with curry and a slightly spicy ketchup sauce.  It reminded me of Umami although the sauces perhaps lacked a little more fire than others who have tried a similar menu deal.  The burger looked pretty fascinating - a nicely cooked patty, duck bacon, a fried egg on a sesame seed bun.  The duck bacon was excellent in itself and the fried egg was a nice complement.  Perhaps I felt the burger lacked a certain kick of flavor along with the fairly dry bun.  The burger felt like it should have melted in my mouth but only the bacon/fried egg did.  Unfortunately, the end result was a so-so taste experience.     It isn't to say the restaurant is bad persay - I just believe that the burger I had was a bit overhyped for what I was finally expecting.  It's definitely a cool joint that is worth checking out for burger fans and shouldn't completely destroy your wallet.  I just think I'll give it one more try and look for another burger with a bit more oomph in taste.    [You get 'preferential access' and slightly cheaper prices if you're a Total Rewards member by the way.]"}
{"text":"Not very please with the service of the restaurant. The wait is incredibly long even after you sat down and It took a while to take down our orders. All which is understandable, but I was baffled when we were about to get seated, a couple paid the hostess money to get seated right away instead of waiting the hour that we did. Wouldn't expect that from the service of a Gordon Ramsey Restaurant.   Food on the other hand was great! Got the hell's kitchen burger, buffalo wings, truffle fries and shake number five which was coffee and chocolate pudding. ALL DELICIOUS. The shake was incredible, nothing tasted so sweet and wonderful, it was like a party in my mouth. The burger had a good heat to it and was cooked perfectly. The truffle fries are so good especially with the red sauce which is a little like marinara sauce."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with husband. I ordered fountain drink ($4), Caesar Salad ($12), your basic cheeseburger ($13), and a shake ($9). Husband ordered a drink, a specialty burger at $18, plus fries ($11), and a shake.   Everything was fine. Nothing special, I've definitely had better. Some times it was like Gordon Ramsay just wanted to do something \"fancy\" and it was just annoying. Like he uses Roma tomatoes on his cheeseburger instead of sliced tomatoes.  He added sliced apples to the Caesar Salad, again a \"fancy\" creative addition that I barely noticed. Salad was actually best part of meal.   The shakes were arguably the worst. The first half is pudding. Like real pudding, but the pudding wasn't good, in our opinions, and then the rest of the shake was your typical milkshake that was gone in like 5 slurps. The shake was good, but my portion was automatically halved by having mediocre pudding on top. Sharing is simply not an option for the shakes.   The fries were truffle parmesan. They were Ok. Again, fancy creative = over the top and I barely had any. The ketchup also tasted different, most likely Gordon Ramsay's own recipe.   Wouldn't recommend, won't return. But again it is decent quality just not particularly tastey (or, therefore, worth the price)."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey and pretty much watch all of his tv shows, so you can imagine my excitement to finally try some of his food. This was my girlfriends first time in Vegas we flew in early to do a little site seeing and then got to BurGR about 20 minutes before they opened, lucky for us the first ones in line, the line continued to grow until it was almost wrapped onto the casino floor. First impression was great, we were greeted by the 5 different hostesses working that morning and seated immediately upon opening. The server was very friendly and since we had been staring at the menu for some time we knew exactly what we wanted. I ordered the Farm Burger with duck breast bacon and a fried egg, my girlfriend ordered the Euro Burger with a sharing side of truffle fries. Wait time was minimal for our food and everything was cooked perfectly. The farm burger is by far the best burger that I have ever had, complimented with the delicious duck bacon I cannot imagine another burger tasting any better than this. The truffle fries and Euro Burger were also very good, we definitely got our money's worth. Side note the burgers are only 7 ounces but trust me when I say it will be plenty of food, I went into a food coma shortly after and had to walk around the strip to take off the extra weight. I come to Vegas about twice a year so I am hoping to experience this place again soon!"}
{"text":"Tried their 'signature hot dog' or dawg, with the fresh roasted chili, but honestly, the bun actually tasted better.  Quite good actually, some real freshness to it. Almost a crispy texture and a soft bite into it.  The avocado was a nice touch.  One of the true good values, few if any, in Vegas lol.   Will order again.  And their burger too possibly, too  many scary reviews here for that.  I knew I should've ordered one at Holstein's instead."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THE FISH.   Inedible.   The breading sticky and gummy and not cooked completely, and yet too tough to cut!   Foods took a long time.   Burgers were ok, but not worth $15.   Took forever. Restaurant was so loud it was difficult to have conversation at the table.   Add to all that our waitress rushed us to order,  especially drinks.   Given almost no time to look at the drink menu, which isn't in the table when you sit down.  Said I would start with water and then she took the drink menu away with her!"}
{"text":"The jalepeno burger and truffle fries are a must!!! Came here during the EDC weekend so you can imagine that it was super packed already. The line was wrapping around the whole place and when we asked how long the wait would be, they said about an hour and a half. So we decided to just to-go it. Plan accordingly if you want to try!"}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in Vegas I have to eat here. I always order the farm burger and the jalapeño poppers this this is the second time I have the hod burger and first time was good but plain. They now made it much better and now preffered over the farm burger. Not comes with jog patty, hog bacon and hog bbq pulled hog with so much melty cheese"}
{"text":"Very good hella kitchen burger and the fries with egg and salami!  The line went fast"}
{"text":"Went during lunch time because we noticed that there was always a line during dinner time- I highly recommend hitting this place up during lunch time. What a great thing they have going here! I was REALLY IMPRESSED. Great service, really cool that they have the iPads to give you a visual on their drinks and specials. Boyfriend and I ordered the Jalapeño Poppers which were incredible- although beware of their one secret \"surprise\" one that is incredibly hot. These were so good! The sauce they come in is really delicious as well- just make sure you have water with you I think I drank 2 full glasses during my 3 poppers! We split the Farm Burger which was absolutely AMAZING. I love that the servers give you an explanation of what you ordered when they bring you the food instead of just dropping the plate and maybe repeating the name of it or something. They actually explain what the sauces are and how it was prepared, which is a nice touch. For dessert I ordered what the waitress recommended which was the oreo creme brûlée pudding shake. Don't be scared of the pudding part, it's actually really a tasty combination. The check comes with a little iPod inside to do a review which is really a great idea. Everything was really well done and though it was just a burger joint, it was a very well done one. I'd rate the service of this place up there with any really nice steak house I've ever been to- truly. Manager came and touched base with our table and was really genuine and seemed to care. Those are hard to find now-a -days- managers that actually care and beyond that that touch base with you when you're there for a burger. Great place. Gotta visit all of the Gordon Ramsay places in Vegas that guy is no joke-- I love that show and realize all the more he truly does know what he's doing because that place is sweet!"}
{"text":"Pretty  good.  Got to try a few things.  My kids got a plain hot dog, nothing on it... And I tried it, the hot dog it self was good.  The wings were good, I didn't care for the honey wasabi ones, but the others were good.  The plain fries were a let down - soggy, mealy...but the sweet potato were excellent.  My wife liked her hells kitchen burger... I tried it, it was ok. I loved my farm house burger. The egg was cooked well and duck breast bacon was good, but it was more like pastrami, not bacon.   Coffee shake thing with Nutella pudding - pretty darn good.  The service here is amazing for a burger joint.   The biggest downside - wait time. It was a 45 minute wait on a Friday at 2:30... By the time we were seated and done with our food it was 4:30  All in all good experience. Not as good as BLT at the mirage though."}
{"text":"We finally tried out Mister Ramsey's BurGR and you know what his burgers are really delicious.     WAIT TIME:  expect to wait 30 mins or more if you wanna eat at his restaurant but it's worth the wait though.    SERVICE:  our waitress was very nice,  Katie was her name who was great from beginning to the end of our meal.  So we have no problem with the service here so far.    FOOD:  we order \" HELL'S kitchen burger $14, five spice chicken sliders $12, and just fries $8.     ---HELL'S KITCHEN burger:  delicious and had a great spicy kick to the flavor for those who likes spicy.  Burger patty was very tender inside which was amazing to the taste!   ---FIVE SPICE CHICKEN SLIDERS: they might look like they were burn from the outside but they weren't, the chicken inside was white with great flavors.  ---JUST FRIES:  this was just regular cut fries accompanied with two types of ketchup: chipotle and curry.   This fries was ok to us nothing special maybe next time will be the truffle fries.   Overall: I think his burgers are great here especially the buns.  If the bread buns are good then the whole burger will be good.  Expect to wait a bit in line but service and food comes out fast which is good by the way.   Although the prices are expensive but hey it's Vegas and hey you're eating Mr Ramsey's burger so why not have yourself a Ramsey BurGR.    TIP:  show them your total rewards card so you can get the food $1 cheaper."}
{"text":"Alright, to be fair and honest, we ended up going to BurGR while I was abstaining from meat for Lent. So I do not have any thoughts or comments on how amazing the beef burgers are. I do have comments on how amazing the Earth Burger was. On the menu there is one vegetarian option and that is the Earth Burger. I have had plenty of vegetarian-friendly burgers over the years, but this burger is definitely one of my favorites. I did not feel like I was missing out by having one. To top it off, I ordered Shake #4 - the oreo, creme brulee pudding shake. I'm a such sucker for sweets and desserts. So when I saw that I could not say no. After one sip, I was in dessert heaven. The pudding - oh man the pudding!!! That was the shining star in the combo. Thick, rich and decadent. I'd go back just for the shake alone."}
{"text":"So I went back to this place again because I had to have that Farm Burger again with duck bacon.  I thought that there was no way it could live up to my expectations and that I'd probably just worked it up in my head but they did not disappoint.  I had the Farm burger again and it's still the best burger I've ever had in my life.  This time I had a couple bloody mary's too.  And they were delicious.  Just what I needed after a night in Vegas.  It was early lunch time when I went in this time around and they were still packed, our wait was about 15 minutes.  Not too bad.  I'm definitely going back again next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and my experiences were excellent. The service was great and the food was even better. The seasoning was very good and my burger was cooked just like as I requested. The best burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"After getting checked in to our hotel, we were looking for dinner. Of all the television chefs, Gordon Ramsay is by far my favorite and I have always wanted to try his food. We took this as our opportunity since BURGR was right across the street in Planet Hollywood.   We had to wait in a line for about 20 minutes to get a table and this was like midnight or later. I believe Chelsea was our server if I am remembering correctly. She was quick and friendly and took great care of us. The menu has a decent variety of Gourmet Burgers to choose from.   I chose the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my Fiance had the Britannia Burger. We also split an order of the Truffle Fries. Our food seemed a little slow to be served but the restaurant was still incredibly busy. Once it did arrive I was blown away. I have had some great Burgers in my life, but these were on a different level. Also, the Truffle Fries were absolutely delicious.   My high expectations were definitely met, if not exceeded. The prices are obviously going to be on the high end for a Burger, but the quality and portions are well worth it."}
{"text":"My friends and I were curious to try food at a restaurant by Gordon Ramsay, so went to BurGR! I had the damnation chicken burger and some parmesan fries.  The burger was not as great as I expected, but it was still pretty good. I kind of wish I choose a burger with beef instead. The sauce tasted pretty unique, but I'm not sure how to describe it.  The fries were delicious! I usually don't like Parmesan very much, but I did on these fries. I think they're excellent for anyone who likes thick cut fries.  The wait, which was about an hour and a half, was pretty long for my small party. I did like the food, but I think 14 dollars is a hefty price for a burger...and about 8 bucks for fries too whoaa.   By the way, for any of the fellas who like pretty waitresses, you guys will appreciate the their body hugging uniforms. Seriously."}
{"text":"Great burgers & fries. Make sure you go early or you will be waiting"}
{"text":"The burgers and fries here were delicious.   I had the burger with chanterelle mushrooms which was very good!  No gluten free bun, but they did a lettuce wrap.   My friend has the truffle burger and couldn't stop raving.    The table tried all four types of fries and all were amazing - more memorable than the burgers in my opinion.   The sweet potato fries come with a shaker of powdered sugar, but the truffle fries with truffle mayo stole the show!  Must try!  It also comes with a delicious homemade ketchup.    The shakes are made with pudding instead of ice cream - didn't try but looked great."}
{"text":"If you have a group, walk straight to the host and ask to put your name down. She will text you when your table is ready.  Use that time to go shopping or gambling.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle fries, and Jalepeno poppers.   The burger was delicious with a nice Jalepeno kick.   I was kind of disappointed with the texture of the fries but the flavor was good. I prefer my fries a little more crispier on the outside.   The jalepeno poppers were interesting, but I think I like the presentation more than the taste.  I'm not sure how warm this dish is supposed to be, but some of the jalapeños were almost cold inside."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Vegas in 43 Years, but I wanted to come back for two reasons: 1) to visit the Grand Canyon by helicopter, and 2) go on a burger run, lol. I love a good burger. Coming from the San Francisco Bay Area, you would think we have some great burger joints, wrong. The majority are mediocre to average. However, after doing some research and checking out some of the burger joints on Youtube, it seemed that Vegas had some interesting possibilities. I hit three burger joints while I was in Vegas. Of the three, Gordon Ramsay's was one.   Let me just say, I know a lot of the \"Celeb Chefs\" bank on their name to get you into the door, and once there, you're hugely disappointed. Now there's no way I'm going to spend good money at one of his upscale restaurants, but his Burger joint, hell yes. I had two of his burgers: Hell's kitchen and the Farm burger. Folks, Ramsay does a kick ass burger. They weren't the top burgers on my hit list, but they definitely came in a high second.   I think the meat for the burgers is a combination of different cuts broiled over charcoal. The flavor of the meat was awesome; I haven't tasted that meat flavor in the Bay Area. I also liked the buns with the sesame seeds, a very nice addition to the flavor of the burger. I doubt very seriously you can go wrong with any of the burgers you choose at Ramsay's.   If you're in Vegas, and you like burgers, you have to stop in at Ramsay's. I'm giving  Ramsay's burgers 4.5 stars. There was a burger joint that beat him, in my opinion, of course: Bachi Burger in Henderson."}
{"text":"OK, first off.. our waiter was the coolest and the hostess at this place, need to get some more training or fired.   We split this $15 burger (barn burger) that had an egg & duck bacon in it and some truffle fries ( truffle oil, truffle salt, truffle, essence) for our last lunch meal in Vegas before escaping the holiday rush into the strip.   Was it better than a slater burger? Not sure, we'll have to revisit Slaters to confirm soon.   Was it worth the $15 price tag?  For the experience and the right to say you ate at a Gordon Ramsay establishment, it could've been worse.   It was a burger place, in Vegas, with Ramsay's name on it, so it was about what we expected it to be.  No Complaints once we were seated.   I would not make this a major destination if you have limited meals in Vegas, but if you'r in the are and a burger con·nois·seur you might as well try the Barn Burger to see if it stacks up to your local best.  Yup, that's all I got to say about this place.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at several good 'gourmet' burger places on the strip, and BurGR has been my least favorite so far (see my \"Vegas\" list for other burger recommendations on the strip: http://www.yelp.com/list/vegas-las-vegas-196).  It is by far the largest, and was mostly filled, but it's the least aesthetically pleasing from the inside.  Sure there is an awesome looking sign lined with flames, but the seating and arrangement of the restaurant reminded me of a hospital cafeteria.  The staff were also wearing outfits that appeared to be '50/'60s inspired that many of them looked extremely uncomfortable in.  Almost every time a female staff member walked by she would be tugging on her dress because of the awkward fit.  Not to mention that almost no one looked happy to be working here.  The atmosphere was in stark contrast to all of the other burger places I have been to on the strip.  It felt like a very cold and robotic environment that lacked personality beneath the flames that initially drew us in.  The food was decent, but not to the standards of the other burger places I have had on the strip.  I ordered the Southern Yardbird Burger, which is a chicken sandwich, and a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.  The sandwich was okay, but nothing extraordinary.  The fries were nowhere near as good as the parmesan fries I had at a sports book the day before.  I also took a couple bites out of the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which I believe is their signature sandwich, and neither me nor my date thought too highly of it. Overall, the food here was nothing special.  I can't see myself eating at BurGR again.  It is okay, but not up to par with the other offerings on the strip.  There are many other places in the immediate vicinity that I much rather eat at."}
{"text":"This burger was so amazing!!  First time here, and I'm so happy we made it to the Burgr.  Customer service is good.  They were all very attentive and curteous.  Our server, Anabel, was awesome!!!  Definitely a place I will recommend others to try."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was right on. Having large 50 inch tv everywhere was a great touch to watch sports while enjoying the all American burger, shake and fries.  The normal fries were generic, the shake was something else.   The ores shake and vanilla pudding on top was amazing, it's nothing you have ever had. My mistake is I ordered it with my meal. It's a dessert in itself.  Amazing  The burger I chose was a cheese burger, it had 4 different cheeses. I am still shocked on why this burger is 15 dollars. It is a great burger but man are the prices here are very high.  Service was great, except for people taking pictures of you and asking you to buy them at the end. I believe for this price the pictures should come with the meal.   Burger price 15$ Fries-8$ Shake- 9$  33$  a person pretty much to enjoy this place. It's a great burger joint but for that money I rather go to belagio buffet lol.   Still great good experience, but nobody explained what beef this was made with, what types of bun, is it house made? Etc... if your paying this much, I believe you should get the tour of the food."}
{"text":"Came here for a corporate lunch. We had a Prix fix menu since we had a big group.   Had the buffalo wings, onion rings and ceasar salad for appetizers. All were good, the onion rings were super crispy and delicious.  Tried the regular, sweet potato and truffle fries. I liked the sweet potato but the group loved the truffle, so you can't go wrong.   For the burger, I had the one with goat cheese, fresh arugula and truffle oil. It was good but you know...not a must try when Vegas has a lot of great places to grab food.   Overall the food was good, but not a must try in my opinion."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and always wanted to go to one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants after watching Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares. We decided on BurgRs because it wasn't too pricy. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and my girlfriend got the farm burger. We also ordered onion rings and the truffle fries. My burger was nice and juicy but wasn't overwhelming with the flavors I was hoping for. But my girlfriends farm burger was really tasty. The onion rings and fries were delicious. Even though this burger looks tiny it'll fill you up. The burgers are super pricy, but you can taste the quality that comes with it."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The chicken burger was amazing and onion rings some of the best I've ever had. The service was some of the best I've had in this town. Plus they carry my favorite beer innis&gunn. Only thing I didn't care for was the wait to get a tabke and the katchup they used. There's just somethings I like simple and standard. But I do recommend this restaurant and I will return"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place. Have been going here for my birthday the last few years and I can say that I have never been disappointed, EVER. The service is so awesome and the food is even BETTER. Longer wait times, but it is worth it for something this delicious. If I could give them a million stars, I would!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are big Gordon Ramsay fans so when we saw the restaurant as we walked the strip we had to stop in.  It was noon and the line was a bit long, however the wait was only 20 minutes. This might indicate that they were churning out customers, however that was not the case at all. We spent time talking to the hostess, waiter and manager, however Gordon wasn't there. We missed him by 2 days.   I was hung over so I opted for the Farm Burger which included an egg and duck breast bacon.  Perfect.   We also enjoyed onion rings which were the best I have ever eaten.  My only regret was that I was only able to finish 1/2 of my beer.  30 on tap.   The service, food, prices and atmosphere are excellent for a casual meal.   With so many choices in Vegas to eat its hard to go wrong, however I do not give out 5 stars often and BurGR well deserves all 5."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice and juicy burger then lo and behold you've found the spot. Burgr is tucked on the side of Planet Hollywood. If you're coming from the strip just walk along the hotel and casino until you see the Burgr sign beckoning you inside. The line can get pretty long on weekend nights, 45 minutes, but at least you can admire the flaming wall.   I've tried the farm burger $15 and Gordon Ramsey burger ($19 not listed on menu). Both burgers were delicious. I'm sure any burger you order will be good. I recommend ordering the truffle fries and that comes with two sauces.   Service was great. Our waiter was knowledgeable about everything on the menu. My water was constantly being refilled without me asking, which was great! Eating something that savory will definitely make you thirsty"}
{"text":"Great spot I had the uber burger and the cheese fries and they were both off the chain really freaking good definitely recommend"}
{"text":"We finally got to have a Gordon Ramsey burger! I got the Farm Burger and hubby got the special.   Farm burger had an egg, cooked PERFECTLY, duck bacon, and cheese.   The special had duck bacon, Fresno chile relish, avocado, butter lettuce, and English cheddar.  The duck bacon was thick and flavorful, not too salty like pig bacon can sometimes be. Both burgers were juicy but not sloppy. The buns had two different kinds of seeds and were very tasty.  We also got truffles fries, regular fries, and onion rings- all delicious, but some of the ketchups/sauces were too weird. We weren't a fan of the curry ketchup or ranch, but did like the chipotle ketchup and truffle sauce.   Friendly staff, but could have used more water during our meal."}
{"text":"Come early, it gets crowded and line can be long. I had the Hog burger, it was very delicious. Also had the jalapeño poppers which were good but a bit too spicy for me and the Truffle Parmesan Fries and they were great. The staff is very friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"Immediate seating on a Thursday evening, which was very nice!  We ordered the truffle parmesan fries as an appetizer and those were amazing! We shared between the two of us and it was more than enough for two hungry people waiting for their entrée.  I got the Yardbird burger, however, I didn't really care for the taste of the mustard BBQ sauce. I wish it was more BBQ than it was mustard. But, it was correctly labeled in the menu, so I can't complain.  The ambiance was great. TVs all around. Great place to hang out while on the strip."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last week with my sister in law and her boyfriend. We had a great experience. We showed up at 5:30 pm and left our name and number with the hostess. She let us know that it will be a 40min wait but we will get a text when our table is ready. I thought that was awesome. We got to go have a drink in the casino and not have to wait in line.   We ordered the jalapeño poppers and they were awesome. Beware they have one hidden amongst the 6 that is hotter than the rest.   For my burger I chose the Britannia burger. The mango chutney sauce that comes on it was quit tasty. I definitely loved this burger. For the fries I had the truffle parmesan fries. They are definitely big enough to share with someone. The mayo sauce that comes with them complements the fries well.    The only complaint we had was the seating was a little different. The chairs are shorter than usually so the table sits a little high especially if you're a shorter person.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Here's your tip of the day: if you walk by this place and there's no line, GET IN LINE!   Kinda pricey for a burger place (fries not included!) but dang it's good. If I have a hard time deciding on which menu item to get, that's always a good sign.   Great beer selection, great food selection, great everything.   Go here. Go now!"}
{"text":"Everything I order was good and my burger was cooked the way I want it. I heard they're the only burger restaurant on the strip that cooks their patties over an opened flame fuelled by woods.  They also use Kennebec potatoes which is less starchy and makes it more crispy. My friends like their signature curry ketchup and their chipotle ketchup. This is a great place to go for some good burgers."}
{"text":"the wait was too long while several tables were available and set up inside, certainly a business strategy so that customers remain in the waiting queue outside and create a curious effect to attract more of potential customers .. Otherwise the food was good, maybe a little long and there should be a formula with fries included!"}
{"text":"Did Not Disappoint!!  As soon as you enter the seating area you smell it.  Chargrilled meat.  YUM!!  Drinks were delicious and STRONG.   Try the jalapeno marg.    The burgers were fantastic and the chips (fries) are a must-try - if not for the garlic aioli alone.    This stuff should be served in a ketchup bottle it's so good.  I found myself slathering it on my burger.  While pricey (2 people with drinks and shared fries = 70 bucks), it's worth it.    I coulda used a few more F-bombs though (Ramsey)"}
{"text":"Sadly for my tummy, I was dining alone and didn't get to sample anyone else's food or over order. Happily, my burger was wonderful! I ordered the Farm burger that features duck bacon and a fried egg.   Because I'm picky about buns I'll start my review there. The bun had a great texture, not too soft, not dense, but substantial. It held up to all the tasty drippings of my medium well patty and the gooey yolk of the fried egg. The bun was visually appealing too, with both black and white sesame seeds.   The burger, itself, was cooked to a perfect medium and as I cut it in half the egg yolk oozed into the bun. The sharp cheddar complemented the other big flavors nicely. It didn't disappear into the background, but didn't take over either.  The size of the burger was also perfect. Anything larger would have been overkill. Would have loved to try the fries and the soba salad, but there just wasn't room."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a bite if youre around PH.  Burgers were tasty but on the pricey side. (Expected tho being youre in Vegas)  Fries were very tasty.  Definitely order one of their house made milkshakes.. one of the best milkshakes ive tasted ever!  Definitely a spot i would recommend & revisit."}
{"text":"I initially wanted to eat here just so I could satisfy my inner Ramsay and scream \"These burgers are a f'in joke, you donkeys\" when they brought the food out. But alas, it wasn't.  In fact, it was flat out awesome.  Despite my temptation to just say 'Yes' and hand the menu back, I settled on  the Über Cheeseburger and an order of Just Fries.  First the cheeseburger: ordered medium, it was cooked perfectly with a juicy pink cooked warm throughout and served on a soft multi seeded bun.  Served simply and covered in Fontina, Reclette and Goat cheeses, it was wonderful despite the price.  But hey it's Vegas, it's Ramsay and it's darn good.  The Just Fries were just delicious as well.  Well cooked and lightly seasoned potato wedges served with Chipolte Kethcup and Curry Ketchup; I found my self using the extra ketchup as a dipping sauce for the last few bites of my burger. Service was great, helpful, informative.  Can't wait to come back and try the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Sweet Potato Fries!"}
{"text":"This food is Amazing! We come here every time we come to Vegas! Jalapeño poppers...sweet potatoe fries and Hell's Kitchen Burger..."}
{"text":"Went back again, had the cheeseburger. Same, I still don't like the meat, it's not juicy and fatty which is how I like my burgers when I'm eating out. The truffle fries though are still the best thing ever! I also had the sticky toffee pudding pops.. what the hell where these? It was a giant piece of ice cream and a 2 millimeter piece of cake.. I didn't care for it. I went for lunch on a monday, waited maybe 20 minutes... not terrible.  Overall it's still enjoyable, but I've had better."}
{"text":"Only reason for the 4 stars & not 5 is the wait is crazy long!  But I'll tell you it's worth the wait!  It's to be expected to wait a long time anywhere worth eating at in Vegas. As a local I'd rather stay away from the strip but I'd brave the tourists & crowds any day for this place!!  The food we had was amazingly delightful!  The shake we had at the end was out of this world!  It was a creamy goodness that I had never experienced before. I was left wondering how they achieved it.  Even if you're stuffed get one just to see what I'm talking about. It'll blow your mind ;)"}
{"text":"Meat quality: average  Truffle fries : soft and no taste of truffle  Yam fries : decent  Onion rings : tasteless  Service : cordial but a bit slow on a semi-busy afternoon Price : good   Will not bother to recommend others to make a trip here or come back again."}
{"text":"One star off for their service. We came at 4pm, when it wasn't SUPER busy, and yet they took forever to order our food, deliver our food, and then give us the bill.  Food:   That strawberry with coconut pudding and chocolate cookie shake was SO DAMN GOOD. It tasted like heaven and 3000 calories, but well worth it. So so good. It immediately transitioned my annoyed mood to a slightly more affable one.  The burger: I got the Farm burger with the duck bacon. The meat was cooked perfectly. Bacon flavored well. So good! It was also huge!   The truffle fries- Good texture, however it was way too salty for me. Wished I got the sweet potatoes friends instead.  Fish burger- it was like a hot dog with fried fish. Huge and can be easily split with two people. I definitely liked the crispiness of the fried fish.  Mushroom burger- Delicious, my mom devoured the burger in a matter of seconds ( or she could have been starving from the ridiculously long wait)  Overall the food is legit, but the wait?!?! ridiculous!"}
{"text":"GO BURGER OFF!!!  That seems like something Chef Ramsey would say! Unfortunately I will never know because Gordon was not here tonight.   When I walked in, the bar was completely packed and about half the tables were full. I then saw there was a counter by the pass to eat at.  I asked to sit there and they said yes! Why wouldn't anyone want to eat there. You can see all of the food being made. The chef calling out orders. Yes there is some action but nothing like you would see on FOX! I did hear one F word by the sous chef but it was harmless. I needed more.  This is Vegas give me a show.   I was trying to take it all in.  The waitress asked if I wanted a drink. I think she was hoping I would say, \"Coors Light!\" But I had to be difficult and ask her what kind of beers they had. She ran off to grab me a list. They had so many they were all listed on an iPad for me to scroll through. I did like looking at the photos of the specialty drinks. The pictures do make it easy to order.  I decided to order the Roasted jalapeño poppers to start with. They were stuffed with cheddar bacon and had a dipping sauce of cheddar ranch. One of the gimmicks was that only one jalapeno had a fiery surprise. Since I was eating all 6, I knew one was coming my way. It happened to be my 2nd jalapeño.  I like hot and it was really good. The sad part is that the others did not stand up, after that. The manager Scott happened to come by and see how I was doing.  I suggested that the restaurant have an option for all 6 to be fiery. He liked that idea. So hopefully he will tell it to Gordon but I'm not holding my breath. I'm sure Gordon has bigger things to worry about.   We did have an issue but the waitress jumped on it with the sous chef. I told her I wanted to enjoy my poppers first and I wanted my burger after I was done with them. She told me not a problem that it would take 20 minutes.  A few minutes later she realized I was the only ticket on the board and she told the chef to push back my burger. The cook did not look happy.  I diverted my eyes, so I wouldn't get in trouble. So much for me wanting some action here. I was getting a little scared.  I'm so glad the waitress looked at the ticket board while we were talking. I would have been not happy.   I decided to order the Hell's Kitchen Burger which had oven roasted tomatoes, roasted jalepeno, avacado & asadero cheese! I also ordered it medium rare.  I asked the waitress to have no extra salt added to my burger when it hit the grill. She told me that they would never do that. I had to disagree with her. She called over the sous chef who then informed the waitress they do hit the burger on the grill with salt, pepper and garlic. I am so glad I was sitting at the pass or my order might have been screwed up so bad. The waitress then asked the chef, \"How do I even write that up?\" He looked at her and said, \"Check no seasoning on the ticket!\"  I had to wait a lot longer for my burger then expected.  I almost thought that they forgot about me. I looked at the tickets and there were a bunch up there. So I was hoping I just got pushed back. It did give me a little time to do some social postings for BurGR. When I go out to eat it is starting to feel like a job, but I'm glad to share these amazing food experiences with others.   The best part about sitting at the pass was that my burger was delivered by the sous chef. I also saw him wipe off a spot of blood from my white plate. Somewhere Gordon is smiling. It was also a good feeling to know that my burger did not linger up at the pass waiting for the waitress to pick it up.   I must say that the burger was really good. Everything worked together.  I loved how the tomatoes and jalapenos were roasted. The fresh avacado was a nice touch. I also liked the asadero cheese which I had never had before. The bun was fantastic too. I also learned that they are baked on site. You can tell because how fresh they are. I also taste some butter in there.   Chef Ramsey you put together one tasty burger. I'm so glad I don't live in Vegas because my fellow Yelpers know I don't need another burger joint to obsesses over plus I don't think they can handle all of the delicious photos.   So when you come to Vegas, BurGR is a must visit. Thanks to the Aria and the Cosmopolitan because this area of the strip is the hot place to hang. BurGR is located in the Planet Hollywood. Fastest way there is from the street. Do not go into the shops! Head into Casino door and it is right there by the front! Another tip is to have your Rewards Card with you too because you will save about a dollar per item. I saved $2...winning! Hey it's Vegas. I'm totally ahead now! Thanks Gordon!"}
{"text":"Eh. The decor was amazing. The food was ok. The milkshakes are amazing!!! The service was not good. Which is ironic considering who Gordon Ramsey is. I'm for certain he would fire the two female bartenders that were there on Wednesday. No professionalism at all. Lazy. The Black guy that was at the bar that day was picking up all of their slack and most of us weren't even his customers."}
{"text":"Service was great and the prices were reasonable. We only waited 10 minutes for a table and 20 for food. Everything was flavorful and efficient. Highly recommend the truffle fries."}
{"text":"We ate here as we were staying in the Elara which was connected to the miracle mile shops and Planet Hollywood. The service was on point but you could tell they definitely are trained to up-sell drinks and side items. Their food was excellent and this was probably the best burger I have ever had/will have in a while. I definitely recommend this restaurant should you be in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and decent service.   I was at a table with my boyfriend and a bunch of his guy friends and they ordered a ton of appetizers and sides, allowing me to try a girly bit of everything.  Chicken wings are tasty and not too spicy. Jalapeno poppers were displayed a bit strange (like fingers sticking out of a shot glass) but also delicious and dipped in ranch to balance out the hot seeds inside. Sweet potato fries and regular fries were perfect and I really liked the curry ketchup.  Burgers are HUGE and did not disappoint. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger which I wished a bit spicier but still tasty and juice with flavor. I took a bite of the bf's Farm Burger and really enjoyed the fried egg that it came with. I think I liked that burger more than mine.    Shakes are too sweet for my taste when I took a sip of the bf's but everyone that ordered one seemed to enjoy theirs.  Service was friendly but they could have been a bit more efficient with removing empty plates etc."}
{"text":"great burgers, they were a lot bigger than i expected. it was cooked to med rare perfectly. i also loved their onion rings! it was fantastic. this place is really modern and loved the service. i knocked it down 1 star just for the pricing and also long wait. i saw many tables unfilled. they have to get their system down better ... to try to accommodate more people."}
{"text":"Without Chef Ramsay's name baiting tourists in, this restaurant would sink like a lead balloon.  1.  You need to wait in a line out the door to get seated. Reservations are not accepted.  We waited 30 minutes.  2.  Restaurant is crowded and noisy.  3.  Upon placing our order we were informed by our waitress that hamburgers take about 35 minutes to make and be served.  Really????   This place's forte is ummmm burgers. What takes so long?  One would think during lunch hour at this line-out-the-door place, the cooks would have hamburger patties loaded on the grill cooking full speed ahead.  4.  Making people wait 30 minutes in line to get seated, PLUS wait time at the table to place orders, PLUS 35 + minutes to be served burgers that cost $15-16 dollars each, the bar of expectation gets set high.  For the extraordinary wait time and extraordinary price charged,  the hamburgers should be extraordinary.  They we not.  5.  Our order was served to our table after a 40 minute wait.  I immediately called attention to our waitress that we ordered our burgers cooked \"medium\", and what we were served appeared at best, \"medium rare\".  (The outside of my  hamburger was brown. The inside of my patty was red-pink).    The waitress offered to send our food back to the kitchen.   As my husband was ravishing hungry and didn't want to wait longer to eat, he kept his burger, but I sent mine back to the kitchen.   After 7 minutes the waitress returned to our table empty handed and asked if I wanted my burger recooked. What?!!  And what was her purpose in taking my raw burger back to the kitchen in the first place?  And why didn't she just return to our table with a properly cooked burger?  Who knows.   Discouraged and no longer in the mood to wait more time to be re-served a reheated burger that had been double handled by wait and kitchen staff and out of sight in limbo-land for too long, I told the waitress to cancel my order.   She called the manager to our table.   6.  Manager came to our table and had the audacity to dispute our burgers had been cooked improperly.  I showed the manager my husbands burger as evidence that they were not cooked \"medium\" as ordered.  The manger declared my husband's burger , \"if anything, is cooked medium-well\".  We politely told the manager we had a strong difference of opinion.   7.  Below is a photo of my husband' burger.  Does the patty in the photo appear to be cooked \"medium-well\"???    8.  Finally, the manager was not conciliatory nor apologetic, but when our check came, we noted there was no charge for my husbands hamburger.    The best thing this restaurant has going for it is Chef Ramsey's name and its location in Planet Hollywood.  Other than that, it is an unmemorable, overpriced, poorly managed hamburger joint."}
{"text":"It was good. I stood in line for about 12 mins before I was seated at the bar ( my choice). The bar tenders were not in a rush which is okay. The turkey burger was juicy and good. Blueberry compote was nice just not enough of it on the burger for my taste.  Fries were really enough for 2-3 ppl easy. I had the sweet potatoes fries....they were sweet potato fries. With a light dusting of powdered sugar. The beer selection is good. I'm not a beer drinker really but wanted to try the Blue Moon Peach ale and it was nice. Overall, it's a nice place. A burger joint. Higher prices because if chef status.  You'll get a good burger but it didn't blow my mind."}
{"text":"One last meal in Vegas before my flight, and I came upon here after my group left...after being disappointed from Shake Shack I was craving a better burger and GR piqued my interest.   Overall, this place delivered nicely for me. For lunch on a Monday, place was pretty empty which had me worried, but it filled up pretty nicely as I finished up.   Got the Hell's Kitchen burger on Medium, and it came out more on the Medium Rare side, but I didn't mind that too much. It had the spicy kick it advertised, and the burger was well-made and very tasty. Definitely the artisan burger I was looking forward to as I stepped into the place, and for my buck, much better than Shake Shack the other day.   Truffle fries hit the spot and they do give you a ton of fries. I was hungry enough to get through it but on another day I probably wouldn't come close; definitely something to share.   Typical hiked-up prices like everywhere on the Strip, but I'd come back, even if Planet Hollywood isn't my first choice as a casino to visit. Service for me was fine but I sat at the bar and the attractive bartender was always in front of me, which didn't leave much room for failure there."}
{"text":"Well this was our second time at brGR. The first time was about 18 months ago when our then five year old fell asleep during the hour and fifteen minute wait for food. If I remember back, one of our complaints then was that there was no option for a smaller kids sized burger. For all Gordon's professed love of kids I was surprised that there was nothing special for them. We had forgotten how much of a bummer that first trip was and today decided (sans kids) to try it again. Btw: still no kids options. Not sure they want a foie gras burger.  Our server, Ashley, was bad out of the gate, overly fake and with no knowledge of the menu. We sort of limped through ordering. I was already a little bit bored with the menu before I even ordered and in retrospect we probably should have just left.  It's so unbelievably loud in there and the chairs are so low that my 5'1\" wife was like a second grader at the table.   I got a coffee Shake because I have an 8 hour drive ahead of me. Maybe that was the problem - if I'd had a few drinks it might have been manageable. In any event, the shake was not cold and too sweet. It's hot out there I figured so maybe that's the problem.  My wife ordered the fish and chips sandwich - no bread, because she wanted fish and chips. She likes malt vinegar with it (which matters to this review later). The waitress explained that it's a fish and chips SANDWICH after my wife had already asked for it with no bread. Not a smart girl our waitress but also not necessarily a big deal. I ordered the euro burger and the gooey fries cheese and egg on them.   Food came out pretty fast although not fast enough because it was so loud we weren't having much conversation.  My wife asked for malt vinegar. Ashley went to check, came back three seconds later and said they didn't have any, didn't apologize or offer another option and walked away. My wife didn't want the meal without it.  I went and found the bartender and asked if he would check. Our waitress clearly didn't care one bit whether we were happy so we double checked. In the end he couldn't find any either but at least we knew he looked.   My euro burger was boring and a little sour. Nothing to make it worth $16 without fries. It was fine, but I'd take In n Out over it 16 out of 16 times. The gooey fries were just gross. I can't explain the nasty cheese sauce or bits of salami or the weird egg yolk that splatted all over the table when poked but I chose it bc I thought it might be different. It was different. Gross different. Ashley never offered me ketchup. It might have tasted better with malt vinegar. We didn't get to find out.  Finally I asked one more person, the busboy who was the only person who checked on us if he had malt vinegar. It's a huge casino I'm sure someone has it! He told Ashley. She came back and yelled at us that they didn't have malt vinegar. With that she lost her tip. By now my pissed off wife told her to take the fish and chips away. I ate half my burger. We spent $71 on lunch and had about 6 bites and the shake.   The busboy apologized. He should get a raise.   Side note: I'm going to write a 5 star review for Carmine's, where we had dinner last night. We marveled at how attentive everyone was from the water pourer to the managers, their eyes were constantly moving and checking and refilling. No one, except this busboy, gave a single crap what was happening at brGR. Boring gross good. Horrible service for a second time. My fault for suggesting it. You got our $71. That's all you get. Forever."}
{"text":"I was walking down the Vegas Strip and saw they fliers for Gordon Ramsay's  BRGR.  It is right at the entrance to the Planet Hollywood casino and is My curiosity struck because I have seen his insatiable passion for efficient customer service and rich flavorful food.   I got a seat at their bar to avoid the long wait for a table. Initially it took about 10-15 minutes for someone to take my order which got me saying to myself \"5 more minutes and I'm walking out.\" Luckily the waitress came over, apologized for the delay and took my ordered.   I decided to try the Hell's Kitchen Burger Medium Rare and a side of Truffle Fries.   The staff was very nice and made sure my water and ice tea were never empty. The time to get the burger, however was on the long side as well. The fries were very well seasoned and full of flavor. The burger was a solid, good quality burger.... but no a $15 burger. I have still yet to top an incredible burger place just outside of DC that made incredible burgers for half the cost.After an indulgent weekend in Vegas, I could not find anymore room to try the desserts, but they did look delicious. I have a huge sweet tooth and the concept of pudding topped milk shakes sounded and looked incredible.      Next time I am in town I may stop in for a milkshake, but probably not for a full meal.."}
{"text":"I'm a huge burger fan, and this places makes a great burger. Also highly recommend the truffle fries."}
{"text":"Food was amazing as well as the service! I ordered the blue burger, onion rings and the Oreo shake with creme brulé pudding and it was fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. I'm a vegetarian so that is really saying something.  We waited for awhile but they have a great beer selection so we didn't mind.  The service at the bar and at our table was outstanding. Everyone was incredibly friendly.  We tried the spicy margarita with the jalapeno infused tequila and it was amazing!!  I ordered the earth burger which is a burger with a portabella mushroom instead of meat and the waitress told me she could so any other burgers on the menu with mushroom instead. I went for one with roasted jalapenos, the \"burger\" was unbelievable.  We also had the truffle fries and the onion rings. Everything was outstanding.  I went back two days later and had lunch at the bar because it was so delicious.   If you are in the Vegas area, this place is definitely one to check out!!"}
{"text":"Just incredible. I had the \"earth burger\" and sweet potato fries - both are just excellent.  The mushroom burger was clearly inspired - the bread was incredibly fresh and perfectly toasted.  The sauces and cheeses were perfectly heated in a way that brought out the oils.  The mushroom wasn't heavy on the balsamic vinegar, perfectly flavorful and not overwhelming.   The fries came nicely sweetened with sugar - not too sweet, and it didn't over power the natural yam taste.  Apparently the ketchup is made in the store - it's interesting.  The only perhaps weird part is the fries also came with a lemon meringue dip - I didn't have much after a few exploratory swipes."}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious and the chocolate shake was decadent and wonderful, however the truffle fries were old and cold, which was so disappointing.  There really is no excuse for that especially since they are ordered separately from the burgers and come in their own special cone."}
{"text":"Best Burger and even better milk shakes. I already forgot what their burgers taste like, but the  taste of the milk shake was so unique and amazing I still remember it vividly."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay BurGR! There's a huge flame wall outside the restaurant. You can't miss it. The entrance to it is kind of weird if you're entering from the casino side... gotta make a loop around to enter.  == Food ==  Hell's Kitchen Burger. Was it supposed to be spicy? Where's the heat. Bring me the heat! Sadness. Great tasting burger otherwise. Juicy with a nicely done bun.  Jalapeno popper. There's 5 that are mild and 1 that's really spicy. It's a roulette game to see how the sucker is. The popper tasted great even the spicy one.  Truffle fries were delicious with their sauces.  == Service ==  Wait to get in kind of sucks. It took around 20 minutes to get in even though the place was pretty big. The waiter was really nice and really tentative! Huge kudos to him. Wait for the food is a bit long also, but good company can make up for that.  == Overall ==  Slow to get a table and it's slow to get your food. The menus make a nice souvenir and the waiter can give you a coaster also if you want one. The burger is overall good! Truffle fries and Jalapeno popper were delicious. Didn't have anything that I didn't like here."}
{"text":"Amazzzzzzzzzzzing burger. I always wanted to taste one of his burgers and it tastes really good, not overly pricey for the location, quality and ambience."}
{"text":"This is my second Gordon Ramsay establishment I've visited. The first was The London in West Hollywood, which was an amazing experience.   I got the chanterelle burger and we split truffle fries. The burger was delicious but nothing special. The mushrooms were a bit too subtle and the figgy-onion jam was a bit too sweet. The whole thing was surprisingly very forgettable.  The fries on the other hand were spectacular. Thick cut, perfectly salted, and generously covered in Parmesan cheese. It came with two different dips. One was a truffle aioli. I don't even remember what the second one was, but the truffle aioli was like crack. My brother and I fought over the fries like vultures and they were nearly all gone before we even touched the burgers. We then took the remaining truffle dip and spread it over our burgers as well. Seriously amazing. Next time if I'm ever in Vegas I'd probably just order multiple orders of fries and eat them until I feel sick.  Oh yeah, the figgy pudding push ups were great as well!"}
{"text":"This is our newest favorite place to make sure we go when in Vegas. We haven't had a bad burger yet and thinking about going there makes my mouth water! The truffle fries are amazing, though the onion rings are pretty lackluster. That's ok because there is plenty else to order! Specialty cocktails are also great. Love it!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here because I love Gordon Ramsey and wanted to see his creative take on burgers.  First thought was the layout seemed very cluttered and it was so loud.  The menu was pretty neat looking and the food descriptions looked fun inside it so I had hope. My boyfriend wanted to try their truffle parmesan fries which  ended up being super thick cut fries, and the truffle portion was in this goopey mayo dip, it just was not  appetizing.  I like bachi burgers way better.  I got the euro burger.  I thought the oven roasted tomato would be roasted long enough where it created a sweet acidic contrast to the goat cheese it just was so bland tasting, and basic for being 16 dollars. My boyfriend got the hells kitchen burger and the porportians were way off and was overloaded with avocado so you only tasted that, and the jalepinio was barely registering.  My boyfriend wanted the creme brulee oreo shake and once again just not proportionate.  What small amount of oreo shake was in it was super yummy but the creme brulee portion took up like half of it since the bottom of the glasses where the shake is are skinny.  Creme brulee is a very heavy custard and is best served in a shallow dish, and then has the nice crackly caramelized sugar on top.  It would have been better if they had used this component to accent the shake rather than take it over, and it would have been nice if they actually had the crackly caramelized sugar on top, without it, its just creme...The service was at least very good, I will give them that.  So overall I wouldn't go back, if you want a great fancy burger go to bachi burger it's much better, and less expensive. This place is way overpriced for flavor profiles that are not executed properly, and lack balance."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch on a Friday.  It sits just inside the Planet Hollywood Casino.  We had to wait about 25 minutes for a table.  When we got to our table, service was slow.  It took a long time for the food to come out.  I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger.  It has jalapeno, avocado, cheese, and tomato.  It was cooked to perfection.  It was really good.  Also had the stuffed jalapeno appetizer, which was good.  The fries were just okay.  They have three different kinds of fries.  Sweet potato fries, truffle fries, and regular fries.  I had the regular fries and they were just regular.  The weird flavored ketchups they give you with the fries were not a hit for me.  A little pricey but I knew it would be being that its a Gordon Ramsay joint.  All in all, I think this place is pretty good and worth going.  I would compare it to Eureka Burger as far as atmosphere and quality."}
{"text":"Great service and quick response to spills! Delicious food too, and the wait wasn't so bad :)"}
{"text":"First time here and we're craving a burger. Thought this would be the perfect spot. It's very casual, wait wasn't too long, but server was extremely courteous and helpful. We ordered 2 burgers and the poke sliders. First off, I've never had poke on Hawaiian bread. We ditched the bread and loved the poke. But pretty small portion, which makes sense for the bread. First burger was the Chanterelle burger.  It was OK. I expected a little more from a renowned burger joint. Almost too small to share if you're hungry. I can't say it was bad, but felt like It didn't wow me.  The second Burger we got was the Gordon burger which was on special and added mushrooms. It was EXCEPTIONAL.  We sent it back because it was cold (I rarely do this, but a $18 burger needs to be hot). It was probably the best burger I've had. We also go a side of fries which weren't impressive either and the BBQ sauce had a spice that I didn't care for (maybe cumin?)  Overall good, hence the 3 stars but probably won't be back unless it's convenient or someone is dying to try it."}
{"text":"This place is everything a burger place should be. Don't be afraid of the weird burger names. They're all delicious. The meat is cooked perfectly and the burgers are very juicy (not greasy). And don't forget to try the shakes. Definitely a unique twist on the everyday dessert."}
{"text":"I am speechless oh my god was the truffle burger to die for and the truffle parmesan fries! Got a little sick after from stuffing my face with all that delicious food! Service was the part that wasn't too great, staff wasn't friendly but overall I would come back again for the food!!"}
{"text":"Delicious perfect burgers- what more do could you want?  We got the farm burger, the all American (I think that's what it was called), and shared a regular fry. Large portioned and burgers were cooked perfectly. We came during prime dinner hours and although we had to wait in a long line, it moved much quicker than expected (20min) and our food came quickly. Recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"I try my best to give honest opinions so that other tourists can make the best decision regarding visiting an establishment. With that being said...  My wife and I were starving lol. We walked into planet Hollywood and saw this restaurant. There was a good size line, 20-30 people. You stand in line outside and wait your turn. You are in Vegas so you expect busy.   When we got up front the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit at the bar. We looked at the bar, which was empty, and said sure (we were so hungry!). It was kind of odd because as busy as they were no one else was at the counter height bar that over looks the kitchen.   Service: since we were the only ones at the bar, we were our waitresses only couple not at a table. As such, she was EXCEPTIONALLY slow to do anything for us! She was busy and I get that. But then don't sit us here! We literally had to ask other waiters that stood in front of us waiting for food to help get our food! The guy filling up the ketchup and preparing the food gave us our appetizer because he saw it done and we were staring at it salivating!   Food:   appetizer: we ordered the jalapeño poppers. Remember when I said the waitress didn't give us our appetizer. Well apparently ONE of the poppers is like WAY hotter than the others. She was supposed to explain that to us, but again she didn't give them to us. They were in fact the best jalapeño poppers I have ever had! But my wife got the \"hot\" one and she was miserable from it!   Main meal: we both had hamburgers (obviously). I will admit, the hamburgers were AMAZING! Very, very good.   Aftermath: within the time it took us to walk back to our hotel, 15 minutes. My wife and I were both in the same boat. We had very bad, and very instant, diarrhea! The only thing we shared was the poppers, and we didn't eat anything before this for many hours! Not sure what it was, but it made us sick. Now, even still, the food was very good lol.   So the 3 stars was for service and the fact that something didn't agree with us."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: When we stopped by BURGR, the only thing I'd had all day was a half-yard Fat Tuesday so I was pretty drunk so keep that in mind when reading this review.  So first off, my family and I are a little challenged and walked all around Miracle Mile and the casino floor looking for this restaurant. If you're coming in from the strip, BURGR's literally right there... by the other entrance 50 feet away from the entrance that goes into Miracle Mile.   Anyways, so even on July 4th weekend (clearly I'm super punctual with my reviews), we only waited about half an hour for a party of 5 which was sweet because my drunk ass needed food in my system. I ordered The Farm burger and man it was good. The patty was perfectly juicy. The duck breast bacon was a little dry but the egg yolk kind of balanced that out.   We also ordered the truffle fries & onion rings. I didn't think the onion rings were that special but the truffle fries were on point. They each came with two sauces but I only remember liking the truffle aioli that came with the truffle fries and chipotle ketchup that came with the onion rings.  The server was super friendly and accommodating with everything. The only snafu was that we ordered a beer which took awhile (basically when we were half done with our food). The server asked the bartender what was up and I guess they make every drink in the order they're received even though the beer would take like 5 seconds to pour. That's not unreasonable but don't expect to have your beer with your food. Overall, a great spot to stop by. Sign up for a Total Rewards card to get a dollar off each item."}
{"text":"A great beer selection, maybe best on the strip. We only had the jalapeno poppers as a \"snack\" & they did not disappoint. Being from NM we love spicy & these babies were on point however, I don't know which one was the fiery mystery pepper. We will return again for sure & try more of the menu. Staff were amazing & the atmosphere was on point."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Go to Bobby's Burger Palace if you feel you must eat a celebrichef burger while in Vegas.  Half the price, better burgers, better service, little to no wait, no tipped employees.  Don't believe everything you see on TV! I'm so disillusioned. Gordon, you were my favorite celebri-chef. I forsook Anthony Bourdain for you! I have been following Gordon religiously and watching every show of his I could get my hands on ever since I discovered F Word and the original Kitchen Nightmares on BBC America 12 years ago. My husband and I have been quoting him for over a decade. I have even made Amy's Baking Co references in a Yelp review. But the food here was NOT \"simple, fresh, and vibrant,\" as Gordon could often be heard barking at hapless failing restaurateurs.  The fries were hard and over-seasoned. The burgers, which we ordered blue rare, came out well done. Sending it back did not fix it (and I fear the saliva added by our disgruntled waiter did not improve the flavor either). They also tasted burnt and oversalted, and both burger and bun were dry and crumbly - the former because it was overcooked, the latter because it was old (tasted even older than the bread we used to throw away for being too stale at the bakery I worked at while putting myself through college). The shakes were too sweet to choke down more than a mouthful or two and had way too much crap going on. Not just the shakes, EVERYTHING down to the sauces was needlessly complicated: some additional flourish for the \"coolness factor\" or something, not actually contributing anything to the flavor, and often going one step beyond to actually detracting. The food was as gimmicky and smug about its cleverness as the name BURG(ordon)R(amsay). No hint of simplicity, freshness, or vibrance. Just over-complication, massive overcooking, and smugness.  We left 3/4 of our food untouched, which is like a 9th circle-level sin for us. The servers just cleared our plates without caring to ask if there was a reason we didn't eat very much of it.  So not worth the hype, the price, or the long wait.  If I were Gordon I would want to make sure that every restaurant that bore my name and likeness had service and food I was proud to put my name on, but I guess he would rather watch his bank account grow than work to protect the reputation he sweated blood for years to attain.  The only reason why I can't say this was the worst overpriced meal I've ever had is because BEAST exists."}
{"text":"It's rare for me to want to wait in line for more than 15 min to eat. We did end up waiting a good 45 minutes even though we were in the very front of the line. Of course, fiancé wanted to try out this place due to the severe hype, and what do you know, It's honestly overly hyped. Hype hype hype. Not that it tastes bad, but once something is hyped, I have very high expectations for it.  Hamburgers were okay.. Nothing special or mind blowing. Just overpriced.  The truffle fries however were amazing :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars just for the oreo creme brulee shake and service  Burger was good, but not amazing  Chicken wings were juicy and the sauce was delicious but I couldn't taste anything else afterwards  Truffle fries, good but had better  Asian salad with soba noodles - don't order. noodles were super overcooked  Service was great and seemed like everything was running smoothly.  We enjoyed our meal here and will be back for the oreo shake!"}
{"text":"Hands down best burger I've ever had. The meat is cooked over applewood and you can taste the difference in the burger.   I ordered the char siu burger and the bf ordered the farm burger. They were both impeccable. He even said it was the best burger he ever had. The service was also phenomenal. Our waiter checked in on us at least 4-5 times within the hour we were there, and it was not overburdening.   The burgers are about $12-15 each, but well worth it. Also, it's on the strip so everything is more pricey!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Burgers are a bit smaller than most gourmet burgers but they are well worth it.  Had the truffle parm fries, roasted jalapeno peppers, farm burger, and britannia burger.  All of them were full of flavor and cooked perfectly.  It was a little hard to find because it's not listed on the Miracle Mile directory but the food, ambiance, and awesome dessert definitely got that 5th star back."}
{"text":"Located inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino, they have a decent central strip location. We walked from the south strip so I can't speak of parking. On our last trip to Vegas some friends had talked us into joining them for dinner here, we were a bit apprehensive after talking to them about their last experience. With the long wait, I was not all that thrilled about our experience for dinner and won't be looking to go back. Service was just ok, for the hype this place has the service should have easily been 4 stars. We had other people in our party get their appetizers before they brought out our drink order. I was not thrilled and when we flagged down the manager and brought the issue to his attention it still took a while for them to come out as if the server never put the order in to begin with. Staff including the manager seemed to be in such a hurry to help people, it just didn't appear they wanted to help us. Even when we spoke with the manager regarding the drinks we got an attitude from him. They had a good menu and since the wife and I decided to share we ordered the Farm Burger. It was good, but not even in my top 5 for best burger. I was happy they at least cooked it to the proper temperature. I thought $15 for the burger wasn't bad as far as pricing but that didn't include fries. A side of \"Just Fries\" was $8! They were undercooked which made them very underwhelming. I'd say a solid 2 1/2 stars for the total experience, I'll round up to 3 but they won't be seeing us again next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! You'd think that with a restauranteur plastering his name all over everything, the seating would be more comfortable. It's not necessary to seat people in a chair that puts their face in the food. We're capable enough to carry the burger to our face. Service today was pretty unfriendly compared to past visits."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. In the Planet Hollywood hotel, it has an overall fun vibe.  The fiery sign catches your attention immediately Beer batter onion rings are big and very tasty. Some of the best I've had in recent memory.   I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger which is very tasty. I usually add ketchup and tabasco to my burgers, but between the chipotle ketchup and chillies on the burger, it had the full flavor profile I look for. The roasted tomatoes really add a great depth of flavor too.   Service was great, attentive, never had to ask for water or a refill, and I felt well taken care of. They also provide an iphone to fill out a survey on the service, so this might give added incentive for the staff to be on the ball.  Its in my top 10 for burgers. 4.5/5 stars"}
{"text":"First of all... The burger meat here is HALAL(blessed) for all fellow Muslims. So here is somewhere fun can go to when you are in Vegas!  Make sure call for reservations or go early because it always seems busy.  7 thumbs up on the Euro Burger... My siblings got the Hells Kitchen Burger and loved it but were jealous of mine because it was really really that good. I didn't know what truffle aioli was until this day and I realized that I have been missing out.   All in all amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I could give this place a higher rating. Before heading to Vegas one of our top priorities was to eat at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We chose this one due to our budget limitations ( I would have given my left eye to eat at Gordon Ramsey steak, but it was not in the cards).  We were seated quickly, and greeted promptly. The outside decor is to die for, so modern and cool. I did not like that it was open to the casino floor, but that can't really be helped. The menu was so fun, it opened in a way that I have never seen before (see pictures for reference). The drink menu was also intriguing and not too long, I hate being overwhelmed by 30 specialty cocktails.  We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Parmesan Truffle Fries, as well as two Bourbon Lemonades. The highlight of our meals were our drink and our fries. I so desperately wanted to fall in love with the burger but the best adjective that I can come up with is soft. The bun was soft (like fast food), the patty was soft, avocado was soft, and the additional dressings were soft, I think you see the trend here....  For a place that is supposed to be all about the burger that is what I enjoyed the least. It was not satisfying, and I was sorely disappointed.  Now for better things. If you go for nothing else, go for the fries and a cocktail. The truffle fries were mouth watering. There was cheese on every fry, and the truffle was not overpowering. On top of that they were served with a curry ketchup and an aioli that truly melts in your mouth. We are not talking mayo mixed with some garlic here, but rather whipped olive oil perfectly infused with herbs and spices. I was in awe. Our bourbon lemonades had the perfect balance of tart and sweet, and they complicated the fries wonderfully.  Would I go back, YES!, just not for a burger."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal. The fries can easily be shared with 2-3 people. Truffle fries are my favorite but the sweet potato fries with powder sugar is a nice treat."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers but ridiculous wait for no reason since there were at least 20% open seats once we got inside. Also seats are uncomfortable and service, although friendly, is slow..."}
{"text":"A lot of burger places have been popping up around Southern California. I've had some fancy burgers for the past year, so I was skeptical that this place could really have a great burger.  I was wrong. I ordered the Farm Burger. It came with Duck Bacon (Is this real?!), English Cheddar, and an Egg. I ordered it medium rare just to see if they would actually nail it. This was one of the best burgers I've had in my life. The meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The toppings were great. The buns, which are always a key component to a great burger, was delightful. *drools*  Our table also ordered truffle fries, beer battered onion rings, and fried poppers. They were all really tasty. The truffle fries were really rich. I felt the weight gain pretty quickly.  The reason why I didn't rank this place with 5 stars is because the service was kind of eh. They weren't too responsive or checking their tables too often. We waited for help for long bouts for refills on water and requesting additional sauces."}
{"text":"I got the chicken burger with some sort of BBQ sauce (forgot the name) and my date got the American burger with bacon. We started with fury chicken wings. The wings were: perfectly spicy, tangy, tender, and big for a wing. My chicken burger taste like it was perfectly grounded because when you bit into it, it is so juicy and it falls off the rest of the patty. My dates American burger with bacons honestly was nothing special.   Burgers do not come with fries. They cost extra.   Our server was nice and really funny. I liked how she was truthful with us about the food suggestions.   They would've got 5 stars if we didn't get charged twice on our card. So we paid for someone's dinner."}
{"text":"I went to Gordon Ramsay BurGR twice now. First time with one friend & the 2nd with a party of 10. I'm a HUGE burger person & Gordon Ramsay's biggest fan.. seriously.  Upon arriving you will most likely see the longest line ever right along the fiery walls of BurGR. (It's only for parties of 2 so it worked out my 1st visit there). Being in Planet Hollywood & a Gordon Ramsay F&B chain, I wasn't surprised. The place itself is surprisingly small. Probably because it only got a small space near the busy foot traffic exit/entrance of the hotel. It's actually not bad if you're with 1 other person & can wait in the line, but my group of 10 was split between 2 tables in the end & we waited almost 5 hours before I got a text  saying our tables were ready (They DO NOT take RESERVATIONS). And our 2 groups of 5 never saw each other throughout the entire meal. I'm pretty sure it was a slower day. But thanks staff, for the attentive & great service from beginning to the end :) Waiter recommendations were also spot on & helpful.  THE FOOD:   I ordered the HONEY-PIG BAO BUNS b/c they looked delicious on the menu. It was $13. For TWO (2) Bao Buns. The pork was probably not imported or magical I assume. Each finish-able in 2 bites each & just slapped together really quick. Such a disappointment when it only tasted okay & I could make a better one at home.   HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER. The meat was cooked & seasoned well, but again the size/portion was a little disappointing. Also, I wish the burger had more contrast in texture. Great flavors.. but roasted jalapeno & tomato, cheese avocado are all mushy ingredients.. Saved by the brioche bread though. Yum.   I also got the DAMNATION CHICKEN BURGER. (Thanks BurGR for letting me take out the blue cheese!) It was okay. Probably better if you like blue cheese & didn't omit it. But the chicken burger was juicy & I totally understood the flavor concept. I ordered this when I went with the group & I wasn't too hungry.   My friend ordered the FARM BURGER. How can you say no to bacon?! Especially if it's duck breast bacon! And who can say no to a fried egg?! It was great & I know one of the most popular menu items.   Also got a side of TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES. They were deeeelicious & a good portion :) Love the truffle aioli too.   Lastly, GET A SHAKE. Shake #4 CREME BRULEE PUDDING OREO SHAKE... It's amazing. The shakes are all crazy delicious flavors & ingredients creating 5 unique shakes. SO WORTH IT.   My final opinion? If I lived near Vegas, I'd definitely go & try every burger if I could. Burgers are my favorite food & this place pioneers innovative & creative flavor concepts/ideas. Beyond the waiting in line it's pretty great. I gave 4 STARS because of the OVERPRICED appetizer & the QUALITY of the dishes didn't reach my standard. I know they're busy & they need to keep tickets going but.. I felt like I always received my food as if it was thrown together quickly.. :( poo..  BUDGET: $$ ($25 per person) Burgers: $15 avg // Sides: $10 avg // Shakes: $9 ATMOSPHERE: unique, modern, stylish/hip, lounge, bar. TASTE: 5 of 5 FILLING: Content. Filled when you share the fries or a shake! CONVENIENCE: Not group friendly :( Get ready to do some waiting..."}
{"text":"Even though the line was long, we only waited aprox 10-15 min to be seated. Our hostess and waitress were very friendly and nice. We got refills instantly on beverages without having to ask - a HUGE plus. But it took 37 mins to get our burgers and fries. Our burgers were cooked to our asking but lacked any taste, definitely needed more seasoning, salt and pepper are not provided on the table. The tomatoes in my burger were about 1/2 an inch thick, had to remove them so's to get a decent bite, because the burgers stand tall. The fries were equally bland, hardly any flavor and very dry - McDonalds fries win hands down! My husband was upset that we didn't get regular ketchup. We received 3 different flavors, which one was spicy and bitter, one was sweet/hickory and bitter, the 3rd was just gross. The fourth flavor was a Parmesan something-or-other, which was the better tasting of all. The music was really loud, felt like my husband and I were shouting at each other. Overall disappointing considering it's Gordon Ramsey, we expected more because it is Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. Needless to say, we shan't be returning but the experience was fun. Because it was our anniversary dinner date, rather than getting upset, we passed the time making fun of our food."}
{"text":"Don't forget to show them your \"Total Rewards\" to receive $1 off EACH item you order! If you don't have a player's card, you can get them for free in the casino.   Came here with high hopes since it was a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.... I was surprise to see how small and open the restaurant was. The service, branding, and ambiance was pretty nice and flashy, but the food was a bit too salty.   There's a separate line for people with parties of two or less. Parties with three or more can go straight to the hostess and add their name to the waiting list. They take down your number and text you when your table is ready. Apparently, you only have 10 minutes to get to the restaurant before they give away your table.    Our waiter was very nice and knowledgable. There's a ton of fancy ingredients with a variety of cheeses and truffle oil.  The hog burger is apparently their signature burger and the pork is recommended to be cooked at medium temperature. The waiter explained that the burger was like the kobe beef of pork. Minus the quality of the meat, and how it was prepared, my friends thought the burger did not have any other special 'kick' to it. Their Earth Burger was surprisingly good though it did not sound that interesting since the patties were portobello mushrooms. It was quite filling and delicious.  The fries, onion rings, and parmesan cheese fries were okay. Again, not spectacular, but it hit the spot.  But what made this place so special? Their delicious fatty milkshakes! I got their #2 milk shake, which was coconut pudding strawberry milkshake. It was quite delicious though it was EXTREMELY sweet. I've also noticed the milkshake also did not taste like a typical milkshake. The shake wasn't cold, nor did it have that chunky ice cream taste.   I also got the privilege to try my friend's Creme Brûlée pudding Oreo milkshake. That was a lot tastier than mine, and I would probably recommend that over the Strawberry milkshake.   This place closes late, so I would recommend coming here after a few drinks or during off hours."}
{"text":"Really good, really filling.  For two: get a burger a piece and share either an order of fries or a shake.  It'll be tempting to get two burgers, two orders of fries and split a shake.  You'll feel bad if you try to finish it all and you'll also feel bad not finishing because it's so freaking delicious.  The euro burger is wonderful.   The oven rotasted tomatoes add acidity that is much needed. My guy appreciated the farm burger, even let me try the duck bacon.....SO GOOD!  Glad we waited the 45 min or so in line.  (Line is for parties of 2, any others save your time and approach the hostess stand. There's a sign towards the start of the line...) Well done, Ramsay, well done."}
{"text":"The burgers were worth the 1 hr. wait. But they could have accommodated us. They gave us a booth and we had 2 ladies walking in a cane. We requested for a table instead because it was hard to slide in. They said another 30min. wait. Come on!!!! There were empty tables around. No respect for senior citizens and handicap women!!! Ramsy should hear about this. They should add more servers!"}
{"text":"Just recently re-visited this place. Somehow it doesn't taste as good as it did last year. The burger's meat tasted dry. The service was not really accommodating either, it was a bit difficult just to get some more sauce and our check, I guess our server didn't really check-in on us."}
{"text":"Love hitting this place up anytime I come to Vegas now that I discovered it. I come with friends or by myself if I just want to slip into the bar and not wait for seating (yes it's that good that I will leave my boys at the hotel). It's a must try if you're in the mood for one of the best high quality burgers you'll ever have in your life. I love the decor and the service is always top notch. And you know with Gordon you're always gonna get the best!   The menu is pretty straight forward and not overwhelming with your great basic backyard comfort food choices with a kick. The place has great ambiance and feel to it and is always buzzing with people. The bar area has nice big flatscreens to catch a game at, great liquor choices and the bartenders are super chill which I like.   Your food is brought out on high standard plates and the sides in decorative funnel cups with amazing dipping sauces that give you two wonderful choices of flavor with whichever bite you choose. I had the farm burger with duck bacon, sharp cheddar and a fried egg which in and by itself would of been incredible but then you add the super huge battered onion rings to your burger and it puts your tastebuds into a whole other stratosphere! I also hear that the shakes and hotdogs are very good and I guess the next time that I'm in town I'll have to try those to check them off my list! Trust me...I don't think that you could go wrong with anything that you order from here and it's worth the wait if there is a line. Just make sure you block out a couple of hours to eat if you have 4 or more people."}
{"text":"I always walked by this restaurant but never had he chance to come in because the lines were ridiculous. I went on a weekday so lines are good. If you have a party of three or more they will text you and you don't have to wait in that line. The food matched the hype. So good.   I started off with the roasted jalapeño poppers. They were delicious. Served in individual shot glasses with a flavorful ranch dipping sauce at the bottom. 6 total poppers in one order. I also ordered the Caesar salad. It had kale it in. I love kale!! He Caesar salad also had sliced green apples in it to cut he richness of the dressing.   I ordered the chanterelle burger. Talk about umami. I love the arugula. Doesn't come with fries so I ordered the truffle fries. *drool*   To top it all off I ordered the Pudding shake #5 which is a hazelnut pudding with a coffee shake. Think Nutella pudding and then washing that rich thick pudding with a coffee milk shake. Pretty glad that was a chill night and not a clubbing night."}
{"text":"MMMMM pretty yummy! Some odd sounding burgers.but pretty good. I regret not stepping out of the box and ordering some thing else."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and i went here for my bachelorette dinner back in October.  It was AWESOME.  The place is not as pricey as you may expect from a popular hot spot in Vegas, the drinks were EXCELLENT, the food was amazing.  We had so much fun, the waiter was very attentive (wish i could remember his name).  It helped that one of the girls knew somebody and we didn't wait in line at all.  I usually hate waiting in line.    All in all, great times were had! Highly recommend for group dinners!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here while we were in Vegas a few weeks ago, and we have not stopped thinking/talking about the burgers here since!!  We came in here with very high expectations, since we are avid Kitchen Nightmares watchers and figured this restaurant had the highest standards, and I'm pleased to say every expectation was met.  Our burgers were literally the best burgers we have ever had and we have been craving them ever since. We also loved the fries! The come with 2 delicious dipping sauces, and there was one that I LOVED, but I forget what the name of it was. The prices were also very decent for the quality of food we received.  I HIGHLY recommend BurGR if you're looking for an awesome burger!"}
{"text":"The wait: Ridiculously long.  The burger taste: Absolutely fantastic! The price: Outrageously overpriced.  The environment: Unexpectedly casual for GR.  The shakes: MUST TRY. Oreo. Get it.  The name of the burger is escaping me at the moment, but it's the one with arugula salad and fig onion jam.  I'm still drooling over the jam and how perfectly cooked the burger was.  The multigrain bun it came on was also soft and fluffy, just the way I like it!  The truffle fries were delicious but I was slightly disappointed because they tasted like they had been sitting out for some time.  Now, onto dessert! You have to, I repeat, HAVE TO try their Oreo shake....it is simply mind blowing! My two favorites: Creme brulee and oreo....genius combo, put into one shake.  The two paired so well together.  If I wasn't clubbing that night, believe me, I wouldda finished that baby like no other, but poor me had to worry about fitting into my tight skirt that night!   Overall, this just might be the 2nd best burger I've ever had (first being Father's Office)."}
{"text":"Food is solid, which I expected from a Gordon Ramsay establishment.  I ordered the Britannia burger (recommended) both times.  The first time, we went during the mid-afternoon when the place was starting to slow down from the lunch crowd.  Burger came out perfect, truffle fries (a must) were solid.  The second time, we went during dinner time.  The food was good, but not as up to snuff as the first time.  The price is what it is, considering the location.   Prepare to wait on line.  The wait is unnecessary long, considering how many empty tables I saw when I left the restaurant.  Not sure if it is a staffing issue or a \"let's make it look prestigious\" issue.  Doesn't take anything away from my opinion of the place, though."}
{"text":"Being big fans of Gordon Ramsey, we just had to try this place out. We went here a couple months ago while visiting Vegas. They were pretty busy but when we put ourname in, they had us sit in the entry lounge/bar area. Very nice, especially with all the walking, my back was hurting so I was ready to sit.   The staff was very friendly! The food was delicious. We ordered the hummus and sweet potato fries. Both were VERY yummy!! My husband ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and I ordered the hot dog. My husband really enjoyed his burger and my hot dog is clearly not your average size hot dog. It extended a couple inches out of each side of the bun. We we're sitting at a table across from a booth full of guys. Yeah, I was NOT about to bite into this hot dog with them sitting there...lol. Good thing for the handy dandy fork and knife. ;)  Prices were a little more than your average restaurant but come on, you're in Vegas. That's to be expected. We enjoyed the service, food and atmosphere that we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for the poor service at the  reception desk.  We were texted to come to the front desk, told our table was going to be ready in just a few minutes as they were cleaning it off and it took 25 minutes after we explained we had a plane to catch and we asked to talk with the manager.  However, the burgers were great."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have been here before and loved it, I still loved it the second time around. I am rating it three stars based on service. We were there for Nascar weekend and also my daughters 21st birthday. I put our table in at 8 adults and TWO children, we waited about 40 minutes. They put us at a high bar stool table that only fit 8, so I told them I said two children as well and they re-seated us within a reasonable time of about 5 minutes with a perfect table. I asked the server if they do anything for birthdays, just something simple to acknowledge why we were there as my daughter loved the place and she said yes they would bring her a push pop dessert. The food was excellent! We got the gooey fries (TO DIE FOR) and 2 orders of onion rings as appetizers, it was perfect, all ate up nothing left over no problem. Everyone loved their burgers and my daughter, husband and myself all got the crisp fish sandwiches, so good, the malt vinegar chips are the perfect touch. When the check came for over 250.00 I was happy with that, but the server had forgotten to acknowledge the birthday, it really was not that big of a deal to me, but we had two kids there, one who is a toddler and at that stage, she doesn't believe a birthday happens without a candle and fire and a cake! All in all, we will be back, but the service could have been better having to wait for a second table and not remembering the birthday."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was great. I used to be a big Gordon Ramsay fan but I'm kind of bored with him now that he is so famous (and he doesn't seem as genuinely angry anymore so his cussing is not as entertaining). I definitely had no interest in going to his steak restaurant in Paris, but a quick Gordon Ramsay burger sounded like something I could throw in my schedule.  I got this coffee milkshake.. with pudding on the top. It was one of the best milk shakes I've ever had!   Their truffle parmesan fries and onion rings were very good. I also tried some \"farm\" burger and brittania burger. I liked the brittania burger a little bit more.. but both were some of the best burgers I ever ate.   The location is very convenient and I will return there a few more times if there is not too long of a wait.   Also the menu is really annoying looking... kind of scary. It's basically Gordon Ramsay's face and it splits open and splits his head in half. I guess it's kind of funny."}
{"text":"We had dinner here at midnight. At that hour, you kind of expect mediocre service and food to kind of just get you by. This was one of the best burgers I've had. I had a turkey burger and it was perfection. At first the fact that it was topped with blueberry compote sounded odd, but it worked so so well. Our truffle fries were fresh and fantastic, and my friends blue cheese burger was great.  A little pricey for a burger from the outset, but keep in mind it goes with Vegas prices, and you're eating GR creations.  Would definitely recommended for any occasion!"}
{"text":"I was SO disappointed with my visit to Gordon Ramsay's BugGR. And it wasn't with the food. Both my boyfriend and my burger was excellent. (I had the farm Burger with duck breast bacon OH MY GOD) so good.  My disappointments arose from the service. Our waiter came over after a bit... He asked right away what we wanted and when we asked for a drink menu he rushed off with little explanation. Then he returned with a tablet with our options. He said he would get my food order while I looked and I told him I wasn't ready for either. He left and the tablet glitched so we still couldn't figure out drinks. When he came back and we still weren't ready he helped fix the computer and took off again... I mean I know you're busy but come on. At least make a few suggestions. Then when they were out of the beer I wanted I decided on a cocktail. Easy enough. After ordering my cocktail I asked our server what burger Gordon would get if he were dining at Burgr (being a HUGE master chef and HK fan I was excited to hear what his favorite was) our server scoffed and said \"ummm I don't know\" and kind of laughed it off. I felt like it was pretty unprofessional to so blatantly not care about the restaurant where you work.  When our food came the girl who dropped it off barely made eye contact, just dropped it and walked away. I saw another server do the same to the table next to us. Lack luster service making a place that should be great, because of the quality of burger into a very very poor dining experience."}
{"text":"It's a nice place but I would have to say if you don't like burgers don't go. If you do like burgers it's one of the better restaurant  located in the Vegas strip! It is located in the Planet Hollywood hotel right outside of there casino. The restaurant itself is pretty nice although my dad and I didn't sit in the restaurant we ate at the bar. I felt that the service was nice for us because we didn't go to the restaurant at dinner time. We went around 2 and it wasn't crowded! The food took a little while to get to us and everything is a la cart so be prepared to pay for everything and nothing is under 10$. There also isn't free refills so when my dad got the bill he was shocked at the price. We got 2 burgers which where basically 15$ each and regular fries which where 8$ and then unfortunately we got 3 refills of our drink which where not free. So our bill was 65$! The drinks where small too so that's why we got so many. I would recommend getting water! Also my dad got the American burger which looked really good and he confirmed that it was really good as well. The French fries where good and we got there ketchup which was a chipotle ketchup and the ranch which was good but not as flavorful as you would expect for Gordon Ramsey. So in conclusion I would say if you are a big Ramsey fan and you like burgers go because it's good but you might be surprised by the price at the end but then again everything in Vegas is expensive weather they say so or not."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a special occasion and thought that Gordon Ramsay's BurGR would be a great place for dinner.  I tried to get a reservation because we were going to have a large group, but they don't take reservations.  And if you have more than three guests with you, you have to check in with the hostess to be placed on the list instead of waiting in line.  They will send you a text when your table is ready.  We had 5 in our group, and the wait was going to be at least an hour, so we went out and walked along the strip for a bit before dinner.    We were seated at a booth and promptly given an iPad that had their drink selections listed.  They have a great beer selection, so my boyfriend and I decided on a couple of beers (everyone else ordered water or sodas).  Our waitress was friendly and pretty attentive considering how busy they were.  The menu is basic with the different types of food you can order, but all of it is seriously elevated to a different level.  They have burgers, dogs, fries, milkshakes, salads and appetizers.  We started off with the jalapeno poppers and be warned, they have one that is extra spicy but they don't tell you which one.  I was the unfortunate one in our group to grab that one and my mouth and throat were on fire most of the evening.  We all ordered different burgers and then we ordered the parmesan truffle fries and the sweet potato fries to share.  The burgers were all excellent!  I had the Southern Yardbird and it was juicy, flavorful and a huge portion.  My boyfriend had the bleu burger and it didn't disappoint either.  The highlight were the sweet potato fries.  They came with a shaker of powdered vanilla sugar and who knew what an eye opener that shaker on sweet potato fries would be!  YUM!  The prices are higher than what you would expect for your typical burger and fries, but the quality, taste, presentation and overall portion size makes the meal well worth it.  For five people (burgers, fries, appetizers and a couple of beers) our bill was just over $150, but no one was hungry again until the next morning."}
{"text":"Will never come here again. My experience here was the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Me and two girlfriends stayed at PH and decided to come here for lunch since we were hungry and this was close by. Worst idea ever.   Two of us had I think the skinny acai lemonade which is supposed to have some liquor in it but it was so incredibly and overly sugary, watered down, and overall gross - it wasn't even refreshing like a lemonade. I can safely say it's the worst drink I've ever had.   The worst part was the ONE HOUR wait for our three burgers. After placing our orders and about 30 minutes of waiting and seeing later tables get their food before us, we asked the waitress (who was a sweetheart by the way) to check on our order. She apologizes for the wait - comes back about 10 minutes later and says that the kitchen had LOST OUR TICKET. She tells us that our burgers will be out soon, apologizes for the wait again, and says she will look into getting us any free appetizers (which never comes). One friend had a conference call so we asked for a box for my friend's food, the check, and expedited cooking/deliver/whatever it is called in the kitchen to make food come out faster for a table. It still takes another 20 minutes for the burgers to come. By this time we're all pissed but since it's GR's place we were still looking forward to an awesome burger...WHICH WE DID NOT GET. The burger was so salty that I probably drank two cups of water and my Hell's Kitchen Burger, unlike in the pictures, had one tiny ass slice of avocado in it - about a quarter of a dollar bill's. I paid about $17 total for this f-ing burger and I regret every f-cking penny of it.   All this time, the manager never comes up to us to ask how things are going, if we need anything, why we all look pissed off - we were here for about an hour and a half in total and he never approached our table even ONCE. He's just walking around with his nose in the air acting like he's a big deal.   F- for this place. Worse than any chain burger or restaurants I've ever been at. Yelp really needs a zero star option. If anything, the one star is for the waitress who apologized many times and did her best to help."}
{"text":"I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. I have had better and cheaper.  It seems a little egotistical to not have salt and pepper on the table.  The jalapeno poppers were excellent though."}
{"text":"The best burger I've ever had. The food was amazing, the servers very pleasant, attentive and professional. Atmosphere is great! Went there 2 days in a row"}
{"text":"Oh Chef Ramsay, must you be so awesome?...  I kid of course...well, in a sense I do.  To be honest, I am the last person you would find buying into the hype of a celebrity chef.  An on screen persona is not enough to judge  one's culinary prowess or personality in the kitchen, since of course everything is likely played up for show.  And on top of that, going to a restaurant that tauts the name of a chef without having them present to prepare the food also lessens any impact their name would have.  I imagine Chef Ramsay was involved in the restaurant to an extent, however, and to be fair to all parties BurGR did nothing to discredit any claims of greatness on his part.  To set the stage for our trip here, you should keep in mind that we drove in from Southern California the day after Thanksgiving, and due to the festivities of the prior day had not eaten all day.  By the time we had checked in, found the place, and got in line it was already past 10 PM, a full 24 hours since the last time we had eaten.  I will try not to let my delusional state from that ordeal affect my overall impression, but I feel it's necessary to add it as a footnote (a footnote smack dab in the middle of the review, mind you).  Anyway, on to the experience itself.  The wait wasn't as bad as I had feared, but it was still a decent wait (I think when all was said and done it came out to around 30 minutes).  The hostesses were friendly and regularly checked up on the line to give updates, which I felt was a nice touch.  My fiancee and I had already gotten a chance to review the menu by the time we were seated, in an effort to expedite the process as much as possible.  Our waiter was...I struggle for a word...fantastic?  That sounds a bit excessive, but he was very good.  He was welcoming and attentive, refilling glasses without needing to be asked, and was more than willing to provide answers to any of our questions.  But I'm sure you want to know about the food.  We ordered the onion rings, Parmesan truffle fries, and then the 'chili' dog and farm burger.  The onion rings surprised me a great deal.  It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but they were definitely some of the best I have ever had.  The fries, on the other had, had a good flavor but also had a weird consistency to them, almost soft and thick (but not like normal steak fries). The chili dog is almost false advertising (despite the menu listing all of the ingredients) as it didn't really have anything resembling chili on it...really more of a chili inspired dog.  My fiancee didn't enjoy it as much as I did, but then I am a fan of red peppers.  The farm burger (might as well highlight the food item that gives the restaurant its name) was probably one of the most decadent burgers I have ever had.  Burger with duck and a fried egg on it...I can feel my circulatory system clogging up just thinking about it.  It was a good burger for sure, but I hesitate to say it's the 'best burger ever' or some ridiculous claim like that.  It did not disappoint, however.  Price wise...what can I say?  It's a celebrity chef's restaurant in Vegas, of course it's going to be a little pricey.  But I didn't feel like we were getting ripped off, just that we were splurging a bit.  I recommend, though I do not feel it warrants repeat visits."}
{"text":"It was just my boyfriend and I, so the wait wasn't too long; we sat at the bar which didn't bother us.  We ordered: -truffle fries -sweet potato fries -Hell's Kitchen Burger -Farm Burger  The bartender suggested since the fries were in large portions that we opt to have one of our fries come out before the burgers, and the other with our meals. We liked that idea and the sweet potato fries came out within minutes. They were amazing. They definitely live up to the hype. I'm going to be honest in saying that the burgers took a while to come out. The burgers were pretty good. Not the best I've had in my life, but definitely better than your run of the mill. My boyfriend thought his burger could have been spicy-er. The truffle fries were good, but I liked the sweet potato fries must better. The aoli that comes with the truffles fries is to die for though.   The bill was about $50 for two burgers and two fries. Pretty typical. Overall it was a good experience and the food was yummy."}
{"text":"The waiting staff was excellent!!!  Very friendly, helpful and always checking in if we needed anything else.   The food is simply amazing!!!  My fiancé and I order the pork buns for our app. The pork was cooked to perfection. I ordered the Hog Burger which is a best seller for the past 4 months and after eating it I can see why. My fiancé ordered the Damnation  Chicken Burger which she loved. The real gem was ordering the Parmesan Onion Rings!!!  They are to die for.   This was the first Gordon Ramsey restaurant I've been to but it definitely won't be the last.  Also the drink menu is on an iPad and your bill comes with short survey on an iPod touch, very cool stuff!"}
{"text":"A few words to sum up my 5 star review of BurGR: MY BOYFRIEND CRIED TEARS OF JOY. SERIOUSLY.  Get the Hell's Kitchen burger (INCREDIBLE oven roasted tomato and jalapeño slices, tons of avocado, and asadero cheese melted on and around the edges of the meat) and truffle parmesan fries. We both got the same burger and shared the fries, and agreed by the first few bites that this was hands down the best burger and fries of our lives. We couldn't express enough gratitude to our server or the co-owner of the restaurant, who was personally going around making sure that every table was satisfied. We went a second time during our 4 day Vegas trip (that's how you know it's good) and we got the same awesome meal and treatment.  Perfect service, perfect food. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place but for the price it's NOT worth it. $15 for a burger that tasted like a dirty grill. I couldn't taste anything but the char taste. So sad. The parmesan truffle fries were good though. In the end we paid $56 for 2 burgers and fries. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Prior to our trip, we were looking for places to eat while in Vegas and this happened to be one of them. This place is inside Planet Hollywood. We tried to get there when they opened to beat the long line. We later found out that the line outside was for parties of 2. If you're in a larger group, you should ask to have your name put down. The wait for us was about 45 minutes, and when our table was ready they texted us.   The place itself was really nice. I ordered the farm burger and it was filling since the meat is pretty thick but it didn't wow me. I didn't really taste the egg that was in the burger. It was definitely a good experience though, but I'm not sure if I would come back for a $15 burger.   What I found pretty cool was that at the end of your meal when they give you your check, they also hand you a iPod touch...which they have their satisfactory survey on."}
{"text":"The best burger ever and even the salad and the fries were amazing . But the waiting for the food was very long but the manger was too nice he took care of it for us"}
{"text":"Great customer service and very good on refills.  We waited for 20mins for early dinner.  The hostess and staff were very friendly.  Our food came on time.  We order shake, fries, and couple of burgers and girly drink.  Great burgers and fries.  The shake was delicious too since there was chocolate pudding at bottom of shake.  Besides the food, I love the menu with Gordon face on it.  The utensils, especially the knife was a interesting design.  Anyway, I highly recommend this place.  Great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! This place is amazing! Gordon Ramsay delivers with this restaurant. The whole experience was awesome, from the time you put your name on the wait list, order drinks, get your delicious food, and then leave satisfied!   They have a cool wait list system. They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. Very convenient!   When we got seated we ordered our drinks. I got a Mike's hard black cherry lemonade and it was so dang good! My boyfriend got a \"draught\" (that's how the restaurant spells it) Redds Apple Ale that was also just as good!  We ordered the farm burger and American burger both medium well. We also ordered sweet potato fries and regular fries. Wow it was all so good! My farm burger had duck bacon and and over medium egg on it. The duck bacon was so amazing! I have never even heard of duck bacon but I loved it! And the egg added amazing flavor too! My boyfriends american burger was great too! He loved the pickles. He said it had the best pickles he has ever tasted! The meat was cooked perfect as well. The sweet potato fries were bomb! I was in love with them. The regular fries were good because they came with a really good dipping sauce.  We were so excited to try this place and it delivered! When I go back to Vegas it will be a go to place every time!"}
{"text":"For a $19 burger (including tax and tip) I would have expected that at least the meat was cooked to what I asked for.   I asked for medium rare, thinking that it is Gordon Ramsay and a burger that goes for that price, they should know how to cook the meat.  Well, my burger came out Medium.  Very disappointed.  The egg was also overcooked.  They described to me that the egg yolk would be dripping down all over the burger.  It did not happen.  It was cooked.  That is why I gave a 2-stars.  It was expensive, meat not cooked to what I ask for, and nothing special - at least for me.  Did not get the fries, but they looked very good - thick, evenly cooked, and well seasoned.  I would have ordered it if I could have shared it.  The young guy sitting next to me only ate  about less than 10 fries, and that was not even 1/3 of it.."}
{"text":"Second time here and it was great again.  Try the chili hot dog it's amazing!! We will be back."}
{"text":"Well my first impression was a bummer!! I did not see the sign that says line up here so I walked to the hostess stand and said.\"2 Please!\" She said \"Get in line!\" And looked annoyed. Then, it only went down hill from there. \" I said I don't understand.\" She said even more curtly this time, \"get in line!\" Maybe I am dense, I was confused because there was a lot of  people standing around not inline. So then, I fired back with so all these people can go ahead of us I'm confused? Once again curtly she said \"GET in line!\" So I was feeling stupid and almost left but I'm a big Gordon Ramsay  fan so we stayed. Then a few minutes  later she looked directly at me and whispered to the other hostess. Now, I'm just annoyed! It's my first time here,thank you Tierney for making me feel stupid!  You are extremely rude!!! The food was great but it's hard to overcome rude"}
{"text":"The husband and I came here after a concert. The sign specifically says to check in with hostess before lining up - USELESS. After talking to them we were directed back in line with no changes BUT like after 5 parties behind. Why would you have directions that you guys don't abide by?! Anyway, this place has a very different feel. The workers' uniforms look they belong in the Star Trek movie. Our waitress was nice but she dropped the husband's glass full of tea. Said a sorry and had someone else clean it up. A glass of tea nor water was not offered after. The Just Fries came out cold - of course they would since they were just sitting out like the other sweet potato and parmesan fries. Hell's Kitchen Burger was pretty mediocre. Their buns are thick and filled with too many black sesame seeds. It was a first time experience, don't ever see ourselves coming back since we'll most likely get Earl of Sandwiches instead. On the bright side, I DO love their wide spacious and comfortable chairs!"}
{"text":"Saw the good reviews and it being Gordon's restaurant so thought I'd check it out, but IMO-don't believe the hype!   Came here on a Sunday around lunch time - there wasn't a wait for 2. Burgers run for around $15 or so... Which isn't a big deal for Vegas. I had the Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings & Farm Burger. I don't think they were anything special.. The flavors actually tasted a little weird to be honest!"}
{"text":"I rarely eat burgers so I figured if I'm going to splurge I'll head to Gordom Ramsey's BurGR! I ordered the blue burger and sweet potato fries! Way too much for me to finish, but so freaking delicious! I thought everything was awesome, including the service! Can't wait to go back to Vegas and try his other restaurants!"}
{"text":"The burger was good, but not great. I ordered a medium rare Euro Burger, which comes with truffle aioli, goat cheese, and arugala. The flavors made a good combination, but the patty was totally wrong. First, it was slightly over cooked (closer to medium well), and the outside was way too charred. Also, the patty is a little on the small side...I don't expect a monster half pound patty, but for $16, I felt it was a little weak.  On a higher note, the truffle parmesan fries were outstanding, and I enjoyed them much more than the burger itself.    Not a bad meal for around $25, and the flavors were all great, but the cooking style needs to be tweaked before I'd say this place is a knockout winner."}
{"text":"Monstrous wait with a bs publicity line situation (keeping people waiting  in line despite many empty tables), horribly slow service (took an hour to get our food, 10 mins before any server came by our table to take an order). Burger quality was pretty good, on par with Umami, which I can get at home without so much hassle. Not the best I've ever had and not worth the hype at all."}
{"text":"Hearty sizes and excellent flavor. I enjoyed my burger with mushrooms and a fig-onion jam. It was a welcome stray from my typical burger fixings. Truffle fries were on point! Seed bun was good - toasting it lightly would have made it savory (but hey, Gordon is the expert). Nice selection of beers. Duck fat bacon was really interesting and lovely. High tech paper and electronic menus and credit card payment methods make it in to the atmosphere. Staff was attentive. Place is a bit loud, but what is quiet in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Best burger ever thanks Gordon! We split the black and bleu burger it was amazing. So juicy and flavorful seriously we might go back again today. Also split an order of truffle fries I loved both the aioli and chipotle ketchup.  And we got the Oreo shake with Creme brûlée pudding. Totally worth the calories!"}
{"text":"If you want a burger, this is where you need to go.First of Gordon's restaurants I have ever been to and it did not disappoint. Jalapeño poppers are worth going there for even if you don't want a burger. Chicken sliders were good as well. Everyone loved the burgers you really can't go wrong no matter which one you get. It was a little pricey for a burger, but it's Vegas so everything costs more. Fries were nothing special, I would get one and share or just get an app and skip the fries. Oh and the menu itself is a nice touch by Gordon, we definitely took that home with us."}
{"text":"What can I really say about a burger joint...?  With the influx of GR shows, restaurants and promotions going on, I thought it might be wise to stop by one of his cheaper yet tantalizing establishments.  Burgr is located in Planet Hollywood, which is connected to where I stayed over the weekend.  Just a quick walk through the miracle mile and there we are.  A couple steps away from the craps table, Burgr looks like a leveled up diner.  Booth seating in and around and a tables scattered between.  The wait staff and servers all wear fashionable casual attire.  GR jeans?!  That was pretty laughable for us, but their uniforms fit GR' personality well.  Being a burger joint I insisted we all get burgers, but a few of the group opted on the chicken sliders and pork belly bao.  Both were surprisingly tasty.  I split the Bleu cheese arugula burger with the sis and another buddy got the farm burger.  The burger was perfectly cooked medium rare, but nothing really blew my mind.  To cap off our order we added the truffle fries and onion rings.  All in all, the food was good, not great.  They look organized from the top down and you can sense that GR was once here overseeing some of the operations.  With that said, service was either slow or nursing the previous night made us antsy for our food.  Took a litlle over 30 mins to get 2 burgers 2 appetizers and 2 sides.   I'll stick to my review and one day I'll be back, but there are just too many other restaurants to go back here for now.  Definitely worth trying, besides it's Gordon Ramsay' place!"}
{"text":"Had to try this place because I am such a fan of Gordon. Stopped by here with some of my girlfriends. They really wanted the Vanilla powdered sugar on sweet potato fries. These fries were good, but I'm more of a savory person so I wasn't too excited for these. The vanilla powder were very unique and actually went pretty well with the sweet potato. We were all going to get the Hells kitchen burger, but our waiter told us that there was a special Gordon burger for the day and it's quite unique so we should try it. He also explained that the jalapeno in the Hells Kitchen burger varies from burger to burger in spiciness unlike the relish in the Gordon burger. Our waiter was knowledgeable and was able to explain the foods well. We got both and shared them, of course, because we're girls.  The Hells kitchen burger which has jalapeno and cheese, which I thought was good. I enjoyed the jalapeno which gave it a bit of a kick. The Gordon burger had relish and duck bacon. The duck bacon was pretty good and unique but made the burger quite salty. The relish was okay, I wasn't much of a fan. Our burgers, which we asked for medium rare, came out more like medium, although the patty meat was still quite tender.  I'm not sure that this is a must have when in Vegas, but it's not a bad burger. The burger is a big pricey especially since it wasn't even cooked the way we asked, but flavor is not bad."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar to watch the chefs. If was really fun and interesting. We also got to speak to the chef. Super cool!  I had the Hell's Kitchen burger."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. Expectations were met and exceeded. I had the chanterelle burger and truffle Parmesan fries, because I was in a mushroom-y mood. Both were excellent. Loved the pickled onion on my burger, nice pop of sweet flavor with the chanterelle. Truffle fries didn't need the accompanying sauces but those sauces were a good way to balance the strong truffle flavor. Our waitress was super friendly and on top of our drink refills and checking up on us. Only reason this wasn't 5 stars was because I wasn't blown away, but overall great experience. Highly recommended. We had to stand in line to wait, but only for 15-20 minutes which isn't bad for Thursday dinner time ."}
{"text":"Sat by myself at the bar and received great service. I started with Shake #1, chocolate with caramel pudding, which was delicious! I was too hungry to wait for my burger. I got the American burger because I'm not the adventurous burger type. It was a little salty, but it was cooked perfectly. Just the burger and shake were pretty heavy, but 7 mile walk up and down the strip and through the hotel's made me feel a little better. This wasn't a cheap lunch - $25 before tip - but it hit the spot and I would return."}
{"text":"Ok.....now I get it. It's a simple concept that is executed brilliantly. The hog burger was the best burger I've ever had in my life. Second runner up is Chomp in Warren, Rhode Island."}
{"text":"Shoutout to Alex for being a wonderfully hospitable and friendly server, first of all. Helped my mom's birthday go about swimmingly and helped the whole family enjoy the lunch.  We ordered the onion rings, quinoa salad, farm burger, Turkey burger, and shake #4. Mom got a complimentary push up pop.  Everything was delicious from beginning to end. Notable details were the potato crisps on the turkey burger and the moistness of the meat. Easy to bite into and enjoy. Note: all burgers come in 1/2 pound form. They are deceptively filling than they seem at first glance, though.  Shake is creme brulee on top of a fairly thick oreo milkshake. Decadent."}
{"text":"I am not a 1 star kind of gal, but this place deserves it. A nearly two hour wait (though there appeared to be room), unpleasant hostesses, extremely bland food, and a strange behaving waiter, all conspired to an unenchanting evening wasted on this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers!  We ordered the jalapeno poppers for an appetizer which was awesome!   A must try!  We ordered 3 different burgers and split an order of truffle fries and sweet potatoes fries.  The burgers were excellent, especially the farm burger. The duck breast bacon on the farm burger was the best bacon I've ever had!   So here's the price, we had jalapeno poppers, 3 burgers,  2 order of fries, a coke and 2 waters.  The total was $77 before gratuity.   Its expensive for a burger joint but worth it.  The quality makes up for the price. A must try atleast once! And the waitresses an hostess were dressed quite nice!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Expecting the brand to be represented better than an Applebee's.  Pros:  Truffle fries were good. Very rich but tasty.  Prices. Server was friendly.  Cons: Hostesses were rude and dismissive to all the guests waiting for tables.  Hells Kitchen burger wasn't not seasoned. No salt at all. Great quality ingredients, but I ended up having to season my burger myself.  Ahi Sliders needed...some flavor. Some citrus or acid. Something. It was just like raw fish. Plain and boring.  Manager was standing around giving servers shoulder massages.   I could have had this mediocre meal anywhere."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here several weeks ago. It's located inside Planet Hollywood Casino. I had a Gordon Ramsey Burger, which included jalepenos and was very spicy, just the way I like it. The burger was outstanding. My wife had a loaded hot dog which was huge, and after having a bite, I actually wished I had ordered the dog. It was that good. . I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great burgers and very friendly and helpful staff!! Fries need some work! Maybe seasoning?"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed until my cousin said we HAVE to try it out!  The line to get in was long so I figured it might be good.  We didn't wait too long - maybe 15 minutes.  The line seemed to move pretty fast. Venue was nice and  cool with big screen TVs.    Service was great!  He was super nice and knew the menu!  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  I figured a burger is a burger until I took the first bite!  Wow!  Fresh and tasty!  The bun wasn't too bready (I haven't been into heavy duty bread buns lately) and every bite was worth it.  We also ordered the sweet potato fries.  They came with honey jalapeño mayo sauce and were powdered with vanilla powdered sugar!  Might I say that the combo of it all was taste-bud-and-mind-blowing?!?!?!  Overall, and to sum it up, I can't wait to have another of the same burger and sweet potato fries!  But i guess it'll have to be when I'm in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Gastro tour for my parents. First i ordered some appetizers truffle fries and regular fries fresh made to orders & their shakes vanilla and the shake no.4 oreo. And we got the euro, american, farm & Hells burger. All were so good, the beef patty is so juicy. The place is clean. Worth the price."}
{"text":"Unfortunate events brought my family and I to Las Vegas for a few days. Most recently my 10 year old has grown a fondness for Gordon Ramsay and watches everything GR from Hell's Kitchen to Kitchen Nightmares. So naturally I wanted to ensure that the trip had some up side's to it to balance it out a bit. It was after all my son's first visit to Vegas.   When we get to the line there is a sign that states if there are 4 or more guests in your party to check in with the hostess before standing in line. My sister went ahead and followed directions and gave her name and cellphone number and was told we didn't even need to stand in line we would be sent a text message when they were ready to seat us. Why doesn't every restaurant on the planet have this feature? I mean what is worse than standing in a line that is not moving, watching all the patrons inside eat their food while I sit outside, drooling and smelling everything coming out of the kitchen?!?!   So we are seated maybe 15 minutes after submitting our info. The place is pretty spacious. They also have it set up so it doesn't feel as if you are inside a casino (Restaurant is in Planet Hollywood). Booths are high so you don't have to watch your neighbors and in turn they can't watch you embarrassingly inhale your food like you had not eaten in days and are about to waste away lest you not get the entirety of your order down your esophagus to your belly!   Our drinks came fast. Waitress overheard us discussing whether or not to get a few orders of fries while we waited and she politely interjected that one order could completely be shared amongst the 4 of us. The drinks never got half way done, someone was right there to fill our drinks, and the fries came out expeditiously and came with 2 sides of chipotle ketchup. Then came our food. My son ordered a \"backyard burger\" medium well and I ordered some Hell's Kitchen Chicken Wings. I know who the heck goes to a burger joint know for it's namesake and orders chicken...what.the.heck! Anyway, everything came out in a timely manner and boy oh boy. The chicken was little drumlets of perfectly seasoned spicy chicken drizzled in some blue cheese a topped with a bed of shoelace cut carrots. On to my son's burger. I kid you not, the kid took his first bite and I swear the kid was transported to heaven. He couldn't have enjoyed his food more even if Mr. Ramsay had made it himself.  My son asked our waitress if Mr. Ramsay ever visited and she had to break it to us that we just missed him by 4 days and said he is the nicest funniest person in person ever. I think that is the only thing that would have taken our first run at a Ramsay establishment over the top was a visit by the Executive Chef himself.   Cleanliness: 5 Stars Service: 5 Stars Quality of Food: 5 Stars  Wait Time: Minimal Price: $15 for the burger and I believe my chicken wings were $13 and the Fries that were sufficient enough to share amongst 4 was $8. So it's not bad for lunch on the Strip in a well known Casino like Planet Hollywood in a well known Chef's restaurant!   I don't have to wonder why the man is a 16 Michelin Star earner? NOPE! Even something as simple as a burger he manages to make you feel as if you've never had a burger before..lol!   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"ordered their Hells Kitchen Burger and Truffle Parmesan Fries. kinda expensive, but honestly, you're in Vegas. esp, the Strip. food was actually pretty decent.    let me tell you something... if you are looking for a gourmet burger spot in vegas, come here.  don't go to fuku burger, bachi burger, or those other burger establishments with no celebrity chef backing. just sayin'."}
{"text":"WOW. What can I say-- WOW. WOW. WOW. The EURO burger is amazing! I don't know if its because I went from vegetarian to gradually eating meat , but the food here is amazing. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is conveniently located in Planet Hollywood perfectly located where my sister and I went to watch a concert. Coming out from Britney's Piece of Me concert this just completely sealed the deal with my overall evening experience. The concert was great and I just had a midnight snack craving so when I saw Gordon Ramsay's Flaming Signage I knew this was it. For the first time, the line and the Flaming Sign made me curious about what the fuss was all about. I tried the EURO BurGR and it was sOooO Goood. All the ingredients complemented my burger, it wasn't too heavy and it wasn't too plain it was just PURFECT. As for the Parmesan Truffle Fries, it was good, but it wasn't the best that I have had. The fries were crispy, but I couldn't taste the texture of the potato the creates the flavor within the french fries. The fries were over cooked and too hard for my preference. Otherwise this place would have been perfect. This is definitely a must go to place just to experience the BurGr but also the ambiance and evening hype.    RECOMMENDATION: MmmMmm.... Good*- MONEY-SAVER compared to other restaurants  1. Euro BurGr (BEST Burger I have ever eaten in Vegas 4.7/5)) ---WAY better than Bobby Flay's Burger    2.  Vegetarian Style Euro BurGr (Custom Made) (3/5)  3. Parmesan Truffle Fries (3.7/5)"}
{"text":"I tried this place for lunch because I wanted to miss the dinner crowd.  In Vegas, going out to eat by yourself can get some strange looks and the second look when you say, one please.  I know who Gordon Ramsay is so I was expecting a lot but I also reminded myself be gentle.  A better rating would be 3.75 stars.  The americano burger which is your basic american cheeseburger was very good.  I walked in here hungry and I ate it all.  It was good but somehow I felt a little let down.  It came to me as I ordered it medium rare.  Some places when you order it medium rare, it looks and taste like medium well.  Here they cook it to order.  That I really appreciated.  My favorite part of the meal was the truffle fries.  It was very good.  I enjoyed them more then the burger.  They tasted so good.  The sauces that came with them were killer.  Rating is strictly on the food.  Wait time for me was almost non existant as I walked in when they just opened.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Overall, I would probably eat here again if I were in town or make a run for his steak place."}
{"text":"It was a great burger, but the price tag doesn't support what you get (2 burgers, 1 order of onion rings and a drink = 75 bucks)... not this guy!"}
{"text":"Tried to have my bachelorette party lunch here and it was a two hour wait so we decided to come back the next day right when it opened. There was still a huge line, but the wait time was substantially less. I'm not impressed with their service at all since they made our party wait 15 minutes while they \"got our table ready.\" What do you mean? Shouldn't it already be ready since you just opened and half of the place was empty?    Then service continued to suck when they missed one appetizer order and proceeded to miss a burger entree. Then when dessert came, she brought 4 spoons to share for a table of 8. How does that math work? Does she expect us to share spoons?   Overall, the service is bad enough that I wouldn't come back and the food is mediocre at best. It's also very heavy so I didn't feel well after only 2 onion rings and half a veggie burger. I expected way more from Gordon Ramsey, but it's just your typical gourmet burger."}
{"text":"From what I remember the burger was ok.  Truffle fries dipped in the truffle sauce was addicting and good.  Push up desserts looked plain but tasted amazing.  Sat by the flames and you could feel the heat.  Service was on point."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for the GB Beer Mushroom Chicken. It's the best thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Best burger joint so far!! My experience of this place was obviously quite different than some of the reviews I read (which made me skeptical). Note that most of the bad reviews have to do with service and wait time ... not the quality of the food. Our burgers - farm and euro - were cooked perfectly (you gotta leave them a little rare to truly enjoy them). The truffle parmesan fries OMG OMG OMG sooooo good! And my big surprise was the crème brulée pudding and Oreo milkshake ... it was heavenly (and I generally don't like shakes). Go early because it's always busy (we waited 45 minutes at 6pm). It was worth the wait and certainly worth of future repeat visits! Way to go Gordie!!!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of Gordon Ramsay, I had to try his restaurant BurGR. I heard that the wait can be pretty long to be seated, but fortunately when I arrived around 5pm, I only had to wait 10 minutes.   I ordered the Chanterelle burger, the Britannia burger, and a side of fries. The meat itself was excellent and very juicy on both burgers. I prefer the Chanterelle because the mango chutney on the Britannia was a little bit too sweet for my liking. The fries were decent but nothing amazing about them.   Overall, I enjoyed my experience here, and the waiting staff was very friendly. I will have to come back again to try the Farm burger!"}
{"text":"No wait at 11:30a! We sat at the counter. Kinda felt like we were on the show watching them prepare our order. Waited about half an hour to get our meal. Truffle parmesan fries were good, came with a truffle garlic aioli sauce. I don't normally like steak fries, but they did a good job flavoring them. My husband got the Hell's Kitchen Burger which good, very filling. Not spicy at all! I got the turkey  burger. Not like any other turkey burger I've tried (in a good way). It was a good combination of sweet & salty! A little pricey, but worth it. Just be ready to wait a little."}
{"text":"Definitely a must go if you're in Vegas. It's inside Planet Hollywood. The wait in line (on a Saturday) was about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad considering it's Vegas.   The food, was amazing. I got the soba chicken noodle salad (no lettuce) & it was delish. My boyfriend got the hell's kitchen burger & he said it was pretty dang good.   The oreo shake was the best part, whatever you decide to get, make sure you get a shake. They are phenomenal!"}
{"text":"3 Stars for this place !We came at around 11am and left around 2pm. All the reviews I've read for this place sound so awesome and I wish I could of traded spots with one of these 5 stars reviewers! I'm not sure if it was because we went on a bad day...but my experience here was by far not what I expected.   My boyfriend is a fan of gordon ramsay and hells kitchen and he has always wanted to try this place, so when we came back to Vegas, we decided hey why the heck not! We waited about 40 minutes to get in the restaurant and another 5-10 mins to get seated. Just a FYI, this place is crammed with people. There were probably like 50 workers that day and our server went missing after I told her we were ready and took another 10-15 minutes to actually come back to our table to give us water and take our order. She disappeared after that and we waited another 40 minutes for our burgers. Seriously? its a burger.   The food! I ordered the Euro burger and he ordered the hells kitchen burger. The burgers came out a little dry, with every bite of the burger, I had to drink water to wash it down lol. The flavor wasn't bad though, just a tad dry. Thank god for ketchup right?? The fries were delicious though! But overall I'd probably come back... maybe.   When we were done eating, I didn't think it would be so difficult to find out server. I think she forgot about us :( ! We had to ask multiple servers to help us locate her...maybe if she had a navigation chip to locate her, we wouldn't have to wait another 20 minutes to get our check. So by the time she came to our table, she apologized and dropped off the bill really quick and walked away! She didn't even give me a chance to give her my card cause we needed to leave ASAP! We were at the restaurant for a good 3 hours for a freaking burger lunch, which was supposed to be quick. But after she came back she took another 15 minutes to return my card. By then I'm already pissed and she acted as if shes been tending to us the whole meal. Mainly what ruined this experience was her service, we wish we had another server!!! But overall, its kinda overrated for my taste, I can go to a yardhouse or even a Bjs and get good burger. But we still love Gordon Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Oh man. This BurGr place is incredible. It's worthy of a wait.  If you have more than 2 in your group, go to the front desk and they will text you when they have a table. Such a time saver for us.   The atmosphere is awesome, modern. (5/5)  The staff was excellent. (5/5). The iPad's they put at your table are awesome for reviewing the dessert and drink menu.   Food was incredible. (5/5) I had a the Farm Burger - the duck bacon was so savory, fried egg was perfect. Not too runny. Burger and bun were excellent.  Wife's burger - Chanterelle (spelling?) mushroom burger was great. Mushroom and arugula went great together.  Sweet potato fries with powdered sugar and aioli sauce are incredible. You get quite a bit of them and they are made perfectly.  The hot wings are super tasty, great pieces of meat. None of that awkward fatty meat you get when you usually order wings.   The milkshakes. Pudding on top of the milkshake. Genius. Oreo milkshake with creme brûlée pudding on top. Out of this world amazing. I would go again just for the shakes. The pudding is so tasty, a bit thicker than the milkshake. I wish the milkshake was thicker or kept more chilled, but overall the milkshakes we ordered at our table were amazing (5/5).   This restaurant is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place was everything you would expect from Gordon Ramsey. Food was delicious, service was excellent. Definitely recommend sitting at the counter where you can watch the chefs at work."}
{"text":"Fantastic. I had the parmesan truffle fries, which are a must. Normally I don't like onion rings, but I could eat their onion rings for days. The duck bacon burger was amazing even when I heated up the leftovers the next day. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed. Burger wasnt very tasty. Got the \"Hells Kitchen\" burger. On the far dry side considering I ordered it medium. Ketchup was disgusting. Tasted like \"fancy ketchup\" from Whataburger with spice mixed in. Worst Fail. Waitress only came by once to take drink/food order then disappeared until she came to tell us she was leaving and to introduce her replacement. Gordon Ramsey needs to try harder next time. Maybe he yelled a bit too much at these people and the food suffered for it."}
{"text":"Wow incredible...I had the Hell's Kitchen burger that was very good but the best was the fries with cheese and salami. The milk shake are crazy good"}
{"text":"As soon as the UFC fights were over, hubby and I were hungry! I didn't have a chance to read the Yelp reviews about this restaurant but we had a wonderful time at Gordon Ramsey's Steak so this place couldn't be bad, right? As a celebrity chef made famous by being going ballistic with other restaurant owners for bad food, service and decor I have held his restaurants to a very high standard. We had arrived and were seated promptly. Always a plus! I got a chance to see the different seating arrangements: Tall tables with bar stools, comfy lounge chairs at intimate seatings for two and booths. We were sat at the intimate table for two and I immediately sank into my chair. I came up to the table a little higher than my chin. After a few minutes it didn't matter because the chair was so relaxing. The yummy cocktail, Goodbye Blue Sky, was fruity luscious!  We had been waiting some time to our server, Daisy, was able to get to us, but she did stop to recognize us and apologize for the wait. Appreciated the acknowledgment. She took our orders and got back to whizzing around her other tables.   The place was busy with a few open tables, but when the Shania Twain show let out there was a long line and a lot of people at the bar behind me. Always good to see a busy place and it gave me a chance to people watch as I waited for my food. The food: We split a Caesar Salad. It was made with butter lettuce instead of Romaine and I missed the crunch. The dressing was made without anchovies. What?! That's so ridiculous!  If you don't like anchovies, don't order a Caesar Salad! And it was overdressed which  also added to the limp factor exacerbated by the use of the more leafy lettuce. I had mine topped with anchovies, but it wasn't the same. Disappointment I had the Fish and Chips while the hubby had the Shepard Pie. The fish was crispy on the outside and steamy, flaky fish on the inside. I requested the fries be extra crispy, but the slices were thick, so most of them weren't crispy. To be fair, I know that it's difficult to fry a thick slice crispy without burning it so I let let slice. It was ok, just limp. Hubby's entree disappeared before I finished, so I can only assume it was delicious! His father was a cook (and a fabulous one at that!), so when I asked how it was he just said, \"OK\" Thank so the detailed description, but the empty bowl pretty much says it all. I paced myself and didn't eat all the fries, so I was ready for dessert. I ordered the Toffee Pudding and hubby got the Spotted Dog. Both desserts were awesome! Both tasted freshly made and the sauces were so good! Our server poured the sauces over our desserts, but there was some extra bourbon sauce on hubby's that he poured into his strong French pressed coffee. Now this is how to end a meal! When we return, I will definitely try the Beer Flight with my meal!"}
{"text":"Burgers are interesting, shakes are divine, parmesan fries are tasty, but the Caesar salad- weaksauce!  It is supposed to have apples, but I discovered only 4 paper-thin slices.  The croutons were greasy and there was almost nothing as far as dressing on the salad."}
{"text":"Best Burger of the week!!! Great drink!! Truffle fries are out of this world (feeds 4)"}
{"text":"The best onion rings I have ever tasted!!!!  Hubby and I went here for my birthday. We had to wait about 10-15 minutes in a queue, but it was well worth the wait.   Hubby had the Hells Kitchen burger and I had the Chantrelle burger. Hubby was very impressed with his burger. I was over the moon for mine. My burger had the most amazing flavor combination.  Both burgers accompanied by Parmesan encrusted fries with a truffle dipping sauce. So yummy.   I highly recommend this place to anyone who has an hour to kill for food. Very much worth the wait and the expense. Great service and everything was consistently amazingly good."}
{"text":"A typical fancy burger restaurant. It was good but the wait isn't. Hostess said the wait time was 30min but ended up a 50min wait.   The overall experience is alright. Wasn't sure what to order - nothing was really up my alley.   The manager named Scott was very friendly. He came by the table and greet us and made sure we were alright. The problem is how come he was the one taking care of us such as from cleaning the dishes off the table to bringing us the check. Our waiter was no where to be found. Hmmmm?!? The waiter only take the order and that's it?!? Role changed?"}
{"text":"I can't believe I stood in line for 45 minutes for this place.  There was fireeeee everywhere haha.  This is a great lunch place if you're in Vegas and not having craziness 24/7 on your agenda.  B- : Hell's Kitchen burger - honestly, the ingredients were good but I didn't think it was ALL that.  The meat was fresh and juicy, perfectly cooked.  By the way, the burger just comes as is, no sides so you'll have to order the fries separately.  A+ : Chanterelle Burger - my sister, Julie got this one, she's been on a crave for mushrooms these days.  Well I had a bite of it and this one was a winner.  The sweet onion jam made the burger, was a palate teaser!   A: Truffle Parmesan Fries - carbs! YUM! I love the dipping mayo that came with it  Overall, I was happy and would like to come back and try other burgers if I have the opportunity :)"}
{"text":"Terrible dry burger. Got the farm burger with the duck bacon. I can't believe Gordon (my once hero) would allow a restaurant to serve food like this. I had good service and that's about it. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Loved this place! To quote my girlfriend, \" Yes! Gordon made a place for US!!!!\" Us being you average American hoping that prices on the menu don't go over $10.00, and they didn't! (For the most part) Behind the transparent walls of the kitchen restaurant goers could view the chefs preparing and cooking their meals. It wasn't just the ambiance that made you feel as if you truly were in a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, but the food was outstanding! The aoli garlic fries blew my mind but before I could get myself together my mango chutney burger came out and blew it out one more time. Portions were massive and we were able to each take half a burger and fries home for left overs.  - I love leftovers"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty food. I had the Hell Kitchen burger with truffle fries. The burger was good. I didn't feel like I needed to add anything to it, but the peppers could have been hotter.  The bun, was fantastic and made this burger stand out over many others. The truffle fries were ok, but not out of this world. I kind of wished I had some normal ketchup as opposed to the fancy, but slightly odd tasting gourmet ketchup.  I will probably come back to this restaurant again someday."}
{"text":"This was a great experience. One of the many places my wife and I hit during an anniversary stay in Vegas. Casual but great food"}
{"text":"Best part of BurGR was the service and looking at the giant picture of Gordon Ramsay.  Ambiance was upbeat and energetic.  The burger was good but the rub was a little salty for my taste.  I had the Hell's Kitchen (heck ya) and my friend had the American and we each said that it was a tad too salty.  Had reservations on a Wednesday and were glad we did because others wanted 1 1/3 hours."}
{"text":"This place was really nothing special. I'm disappointed because there was a long wait, and I expected more from a restaurant by Gordon Ramsey. I'm not taking off stars for the wait, because even at 9:30pm on a Tuesday, it's vegas and everything is always packed. The service was average. And so was the food, honestly. My boyfriend's burger was falling apart the entire time, and the onion rings crumbled into a thousand pieces when we bit into them. There was hardly a trace of actual onion inside. The food just didn't seem like it was made well at all! This was definitely a miss :("}
{"text":"Really liked the jalapeño poppers but the buffalo wings left much to be desired. The burgers were good and I'm very picky when it comes to food and I great indicator of whether I would come back or not is if after the meal I look at my boyfriend and ask him if he would come back and he said yes!"}
{"text":"LOVED the burgers and the onion rings. I knew Gordon wouldn't let us down! Our server was also very friendly and informative! We will return when we are back in town."}
{"text":"Got a chance to go here while staying at Planet Hollywood.  Went during the early afternoon and was able to get a seat at the bar without any wait time.  Started with a Stone Pale Ale (which I rarely find on tap) and their jalapeno poppers.  They were probably the best jalapeno poppers I've ever had.  Hot, spicy, extra crispy and filled with cheese.  Really great!  Then had the Hell's Kitchen burger which I also thought was fantastic.  The fresh bun alone was worth it.  The burger had the perfect combination of heat, cheese and flavor.  I didn't even realize until after I finished the burger that I never even considered adding ketchup or mayo like I normally do.  The included avocado was enough.  The only thing that was a little disappointing to me were the regular fries.  They were a weren't very hot temperature-wise, and not as crispy as I generally like.  The people on either side of me got the onion rings and the truffle fries, both with looked much better.  I only wish I was able to stay in Vegas long enough to go there again and try a few more things.  Overall I highly recommend going if you have the opportunity."}
{"text":"They do not do reservations for small groups. However we were seated in under 20 minutes. The Hells Kitchen burger is amazing! It truly lived up to my expectations. For sides we ordered the truffle fries, wings, and jalapeño poppers. The wings were the best of the sides that we tried, they were tender and had a great flavor. The fries and poppers were just average there was nothing special about them but they definitely weren't bad. One order of fries is enough for a table to share."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are huge fans of Gordon Ramsey's and  wanted to try one of his  restaurants while we were in Vegas. We ended up at  BurGR for a late lunch. The line went by pretty fast since we were eating around 4:30 pm however earlier we did notice the line cruved around the casino.   We ended up ordering the all-american burger, fries, and the kale ceasar salad. The burger was cooked perfectly however my bf said that it lacked flavor. The fries were good but we both weren't the hugest fans of the chipotle and curry ketchups. The salad was tasty but not anything spectacular. Basically a normal ceasar salad with some kale added in.  Overall we were both disappointed in the restaurant. Being from Los Angeles we had higher hopes for BurGR but the restaurant fell short."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after seeing Carrot Top (Hilarious) at the Luxor. I have seen a lot of Gordon Ramsey's shows on TV so my wife and I had very high expectations for this place.  Well I must say that BurGR did not disappoint. I ordered the Farm Burger done Medium and it was delicious. Very juicy and lots of flavor. My wife ordered the American done Medium Well since she doesn't like to venture out and try new things and she said it was the best burger she has had. We also had the Parmesan Fries and they were very good. They were not salty like most Parmesan Fries and the sauces that came with it were very good.   The staff was very friendly and explained the menu. Refills were brought to us without being asked which is a big plus. So if you're ever in Vegas and are looking for a spot where you can enjoy a good burger and atmosphere, this is the place. Oh and by the way my wife and I were sober when we went here.  Almost forgot that we ordered the push pops for desert and they were also delicious. Not too sweet or salty and just enough to keep your taste buds guessing and wanting more."}
{"text":"Gourmet burger price minus the gourmet sums up this place well. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger with the truffle fries. The burger was mediocre, underwhelming in taste and quality. However, the most disappointing was the truffle fries. It had good reviews from other patrons, but mine was soggy and warm - as if the fries were left out in the warmer for an hour. Overall, in terms of value and taste, its 2 stars worthy."}
{"text":"Omg so damn good...  got a farm burger with just fries.  Ordered it medium rare and it was perfect.  Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I'll be honest...I wanted to go to Gordon Ramsay Steak, but we couldn't get a table due to it being the week of CES. Since my co-worker and I were playing hard at the PH tables, we opted to dine here so that we could easily pick up where we left off.  It was somewhat difficult to get a table, since the hostess informed us that the many open tables in front of us weren't available. The place didn't look that crowded, but there was definitely a draft of cold air since the entrance to the restaurant was adjacent to one of the hotel's points of ingress/egress, so perhaps they were doing us a favor...but as soon as we asked about the few more open tables further back, they seated us.  The menu is fairly limited, but caters to a sophisticated palette. Unfortunately, you won't find much bacon here, other than the duck bacon, which isn't really bacon. However, you will find several burger selections that will blow your mind away, and even classics, like a farm burger (it comes with a fried egg!). If you aren't in the mood for a burger, you can also have a hot dog. Accompanying your entree can also be sides of parmesan truffle fries, onion rings, and other delicious fried finger foods. For dessert, try one of their fabulous shakes. May I suggest the ones with any variation of peanut butter, chocolate, and pudding?  You also have a variety of hard-to-find brews available, so have a peek at their fancy iPad menu and let your taste buds indulge. Our server was nice and friendly, and the manager even came by to make sure we were satisfied; something he wasn't doing with everyone."}
{"text":"Super delicious . Anything you choose is yummy. Staff is super from beginning til end. I had the euro burger with a beef Pattie , goat cheese, duck bacon and arugul, it was Perfectly done. I also had the jalapeno poppers and the truffle fries.  Definitely amazing experience ."}
{"text":"I think it's expensive because of the name, but it's a good burger option in Vegas.  The burger was medium as I order.  The fries good be more crispy."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers; pretty unique and well-presented. I wish the environment were not as busy but this won't overshadow your experience at BURGR. I recommend the farm burger and the Oreo shake. Great value. Friendly staff. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Food was good, served quickly - worked out great after the Britney Spears concert for dinner. At times I feel like places like this try to do too much with items on the menu just to be different but overall it was good. Ketchup for example was just odd, we tried three different ones, all were a bit odd.  Had the Hells Kitchen burger, great flavor.  Server was a bit inattentive, the other table helpers did all the work while he was chatting with another table for an extended period of time.  A bit pricey, but then again it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Bit pricey ... Even for the name. Fries and burgers was a above average but nothing spectacular. Poppers were well presented. Will come back for the chicken burgers.  Highly recommend the truffle Parmesan fries!"}
{"text":"I had the pork Burger recommended by Hillary our server and it was delicious! I will definitely tell everyone how good the meal was! Joanna one of the managers and ensured that our meal was great!"}
{"text":"I had the farm burger it was great and the truffle fries was great but this place isnt worth the hype. I don't see myself come here all the time maybe once in awhile."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the whale of a meal I'd already had at bacchanal or the way the waiter oversold my burger to me, but burGR did not live up to the hype.   Not to knock on our waiter, he was extremely professional and very enthusiastic. Service here was certainly a plus factor. But when I go to a place I'm generally more interested in food than service/ambiance.   Let's start with the good: - The beer! With lots of beers on tap I was super excited to pick one I'd never heard of before. Le fin de monde (or is it du mond? Cant remember french when I most need it..) was a great beer and I'll be looking for it on menus in the future.  - The parmesan truffle fries were a bit thick cut for me, but the truffle aioli dipping sauce was amazing. I've never ordered seconds on a sauce before (ok that's a lie, I love sauce) but the waiter offered and I couldn't say no.  - The boy's chili hotdog. At first i rebuffed him for ordering a hotdog at a burger joint but turns out he had the right of it. The dog was longer than the bun which i LOVE. Hate it when my dogs are hidden in a sea of endless carbs...but I digress  And the negative: There's really only one negative, but it's a big enough one to bring this review down to 3 stars, and that is the burger itself.  The waiter highly recommended the Hog burger and sold it to me with high praises. I went with it and was sorely disappointed.  The meat was not nearly as juicy as it could have been and there was no flavor to the burger.  After a few bites I had to resign myself to just eating the fries (and that sauce, mmmm). Eventually I scrapped the arugula off the top of the burger while leaving the meat untouched. The boy looked on incredulously, when I choose a veggie over meat there's something direly wrong.   So, sorry BurGR, everything else was GReat but your burger was NOT, but I wish it had been. I truly do."}
{"text":"The truffle fries! Omg the truffle fries!!! The burgers are amazing. My mom used to watch gordon on tv so i really wanted to try this place with my family. Even the hot dogs are good."}
{"text":"I got the Farm Burger. It was aiight. The pork belly appetizer was outstanding. Overall happy with the experience and the price was right. Gordon could easily have charged double given the star cred but he doesn't and I can respect the heck out of that."}
{"text":"Despite the reputation, I wasn't expecting this to be the finest Burger I've ever had. The food was incredible, the service was phenomenal, and the relatively long wait to get to the front check-in desk was more than worth the wait. I can see why so many people line up to dine here, and I will happily wait again, no matter the length of the line. If I could give extra Stars, I would!"}
{"text":"Best shake ever!! Fries was great! Everything was sooo good!! Always appreciate the good food!!"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! I had the Hell's kitchen burger. A lot of heat, but I like that. Fast. Friendly service. Would go back again & again."}
{"text":"We tried to call for reservations..... no one answered the phone, it just rang and rang. Decided to just go and give it a try. Some other reviews I read said that they were seated rather quickly.  BurGR really need to work on their front end system!! They do not take reservations... Only parties of 3 or more get to give their number and go wait for a text until their table is ready. Parties of two must stand in a miserable line resembling a line for a casino buffet. Even the cheapest restaurants have a better system than this. Waited 45 minutes in line, then another 30 at the table before our order was taken. It was a Friday night, but come on, their has to be a better way!!  The food.....The stuffed jalapeno appetizer was really good. My husband ordered the hog burger and I had the hells kitchen burger. We shared the Parmesan truffle fries. My husband said his burger was very flavorful. Mine was good... not great... but good. I guess my expectations were a little high. I am a local and for me to battle the Las Vegas strip on Friday night for a burger it needs to be worth the effort.  Maybe I will give them a try for lunch during the week when it isn't so busy. The table next to us ordered the hot dog and it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Just ok - I think I had higher expectations."}
{"text":"Blah. Not impressed.   First off I want to say, what a waste of gas that's fuming at the front of the store! NOT NECESSARY.  Anyway the vain Gordon Ramsey is everywhere in this restaurant. You see his face in the front, throughout inside the restaurant, so creepy, felt like he was watching me eat my food.   The burgers were just OK. Very described and difficult to picture. It's also very messy. Also their jalapeño poppers are fried to brown and you dip it in some mayo that does not sit well after you eat.  The staff was friendly though :)"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure to dine at a couple of Ramsay's high end restaurants in Vegas and London, but this would be my first return trip ( I know it's cheating because Steak is right next door at the Paris).  I didn't feel like waiting and flying solo, so took the seat by the expediting station or \"the pass\" or whatever you call it.  The farm burger was out of this world, perfectly executed.  Even the bun was fantastic, obviously fresh,  with a slight sheen and both white and black sesame seeds. The burger was perfectly cooked medium rate and plentiful, with duck bacon and a fried egg, heavenly.  Fries, generously served, perfectly fried, wide-cut truffle fries, I have tears in my eyes just thinking about it.  I couldn't even finish, took 1/2 to go.   Best burger I have ever eaten.  God bless Gordon."}
{"text":"The onion rings were great and the service was excellent. I had the farm burger medium rare. It can medium and after one bite I knew it was mistake. I reordered the American to replace it. It was a good burger but I have made and had better. For the price I expected to be impressed. I wasn't."}
{"text":"As a burger-fanatic, I've been waiting and wanting to try this place for an eternity. Every time I go to Vegas, it was difficult to come here, b/c everyone would be too hungover, want go to a dayclub, or gamble. Fortunately, I was finally able to see what the hype was about. We were extremely excited and wanted to order everything off the menu. We ended up starting with the Fury Chicken Wings, ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Euro Burger as our main, and got a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries.   Fury Chicken Wings: the wings were surprisingly tasty. The sauce was slightly sweet, yet tangy. It wasn't too vinegary like many buffalo sauces and other condiments restaurants usually drench on top of their wings. They were also clean and easy to eat b/c it was like a lollipop, with the bone as a handle. The blue cheese crumbles accompanying it was really sharp and pungent. It complements the wings well, but eating it alone was a bad idea (I usually don't like cheese, especially stinky cheese).   Hell's Kitchen Burger: the first bite was pretty decent, but the subsequent bites deteriorated with taste. I thought that the buns were stale and dry. The patty was cooked to my liking (medium), but it seemed like something was missing.  Euro Burger: I thought that this was better than the Hell's Kitchen Burger. It was slightly savory, but again, the buns didn't compliment the burger as a whole. I prefer my buns (burger buns) to be soft and slightly fluffy (like Hawaiian Rolls).   Truffle Parmesan Fries: although they were only fries, I thought that this was my favorite item that we ordered. The fries tasted like they were freshly cut, texture was crisp, and it wasn't too greasy. One order is good enough to share between three people.   Overall, the restaurant didn't live up to the hype. Unfortunately, I was disappointed after my meal. Although I did leave with a full stomach, I was hoping to have had an amazing burger. Compared to other burger joints I've been to, this place is just average. Due to all the hype, and it being a Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, it's a good place to try at least once. However, I wouldn't wait for more than 20 mins to eat here again."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Wait wasn't that bad but the line does move awful slow. Environment is loud. Sweet potato fries and the Hell's Kitchen burger are phenomenal. As are the truffle fries. The person I was with was also impressed and was not exited about going so... that's saying something. :) I would definitely do it again. Even though it was $80."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night in the summer around 930. They quoted us a wait time of 70 minutes. We had our hearts set on this place, so we said we'd wait. But the best part was that they take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. This was awesome! We got to hang out in the casino and get drinks until our table was ready. Once we were seated we were shown the drink menu. The drinks all looked amazing. Unfortunately, I was the DD for the night. We ordered parmesan (sp?) truffle fries and they were AMAZING! No joke, the best fries I've ever had in my life. The burgers were absolutely delicious. They were cooked to perfection. I hardly ever order a burger medium, and get a burger medium. It's always too well done. But this was perfect. Two friends I was there with ordered their's medium rare and you could see that theirs were absolutely medium rare and noticeably different from my medium. My husband and I keep a list of our top 5 burger places (similar to 'the list' from Friends), and this place shot to the top. We also ordered the Oreo shake and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Sticky toffee pudding is one of my all time favorites, but it was not at all good here. The shake was good, but I wish they had a malt option. Still, the sub-par desserts weren't enough to detract from the 5 star rating. Also, the servers' outfits are absolutely hideous, truly the most unflattering ensemble I could imagine for a server, but that's my only real criticism, which is hardly relevant at all."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, but I was pretty disappointed.  My friend has some Platinum Rewards card so we only had to wait a few minutes even though there was quite a long line to get in.  Score!  We started off with the Truffle Parmesan Fries.  Yum - you could definitely taste the truffle.  each got a burger of course.  I wish the fries had been more crisp however.  They also came with two yummy dipping sauces.  $10 for fries is way too much, though.  We all ordered a burger, of course:  Farm Burger (came w/ a fried egg), Euro Burger, and American Burger.  My burger was seriously burnt on the outside even though I ordered their recommendation, Medium Rare.  Ugh.  I would have returned it, but I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for my burger.  My friend had them put the goat cheese for her Euro Burger on the side, but then made the mistake of smearing too much on it before she discovered she hated goat cheese.  :P    A trendy restaurant that doesn't deliver.  Not sure why the line is so long - I am assuming these are people who have never eaten there?  I liked Bachi Burger in Vegas much more and it was more affordable.  Burgr charges about $15 per burger and the patty isn't that large (and mine was burnt - did I mention that??)."}
{"text":"Yum!! This was a good burger! I had the Euro with goat cheese and hubby had the fish and chips. The fish was like a strip. It was small but good. We split the onion rings and that was more than enough.  We decided to sit at the bar to avoid the 20 min wait. All of the staff was very personable and helpful. I would return."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place ever since I heard it opened.  Honestly......it was ok.  Not what I expected from Gordon Ramsey.  I had the American burger and onion rings.    The burger was cooked medium just as I ordered it. The meat was nicely seasoned. The lettuce, tomato and onions were all very fresh.  The pickled (bread and butter type) were also very good.  While the burger tasted very good it wasn't anything special.  As for the onion rings.....they were way too greasy!!!  I liked the dipping sauces that came with it.    All in all, I would not put this on my list of places to return to. :("}
{"text":"My most fvorite food experience in vegas. The whole experience was a rock! Service was great, the burger was cooked to perfection and the ambience was just great! I loved every minute of my time there and just wished i had more chances to go back to this pace to try all other cool stuff like wings and some dessert there. My facial expression when tucking in the burger was so expressive that a server just shouted, R U enjoying it? And I couldnt manage even to answer bcs couldnt stop eating hahaha!"}
{"text":"Saw them featured on Buzzfeed and was really curious to try what this place had to offer! We ordered the pork belly hotpockets ($12), Gooey fries ($13), and Hell's Kitchen Burger ($15).   I really recommend the Gooey Fries and the Hell's Kitchen Burger. $13 seems pricey for fries at first but it's literally a HUGE platter of delicious fried potato wedges topped with egg and melty gouda cheese, no regrets....Definitely worth it! We chose the Hell's Kitchen Burger b/c that seemed like a popular favorite on yelp and that didn't disappoint us either.   I would not recommend the pork belly hot pockets. They were good but $12 for two tiny pockets half the size of my palm is a little overpriced in my opinion.   Overall, great experience and great food here!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  We came at a rather awkward time (3pm) after flying in that afternoon, so there was no waiting! The parmesan truffle fries were absolutely the best I've ever had on the planet!  The burger was perfectly flavored, perfectly cooked and perfectly served.  Our waitress even let us keep our menus as a souvenir!  I definitely plan to attend BurGR every single time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Long wait, over 35 mins wait in line outside of the resturant, I don't understand why they don't have better method for table waiting like giving a pager, when u have a resturant in a casino hotel, isn't a better idea to let people free to hang around n play?? The long wait is not fun. Lots waitress but it took 10 mins for waitress to show up say hi. Slow service. Well, food is really good and in a very good price, 12-16 a good burger is cheap in Vegas. If they fix the wait problem n slow service it's a easy 5 stars for them"}
{"text":"Here's the skinny:  Dined in last night on 3/27. Got in the walk-in line at 7pm. The hostess/seaters were great; they were friendly and informative on how long the wait would be. One girl went down the line and told us the update a couple times.  735: we were seated and immediately placed our order.  We ordered truffled fries ($11), Hell's Kitchen burger ($15), and the Farm burger ($15). 800pm: Got our truffle fries...only. We saw other tables get fries along with their burgers.  805: waiter comes by and says he had our fries sent out first bc he saw the kitchen was taking longer than usual.  815pm: Almost finished with the fries (which was 6/10), we signaled our waiter to ask why the long delay. Before we said anything, he told us they may have messed up our ticket and that he would find out. We were watching him before and after. He was busy and running around. I get it. But at the same time, it was his responsibility to check on our food status for us, and maybe he should have aggressively pushed the ticket for us.  820pm: two parties who were seated WAY after us got their meal already.  This is where I got upset and loss my appetite. Flagged down our waiter and told him it's been 40-50 minutes since we place our order and asked him if this was a normal thing. He fumbled with his apology and told us he would let the manager know and would make it up to us. 830pm: Got our burgers. They looked fabulous! Was it worth the wait? Sighhhhh, you know when you wait too long to eat and then you're no longer hungry? We were disappointed since our appetite was gone. Plus we were kind of full from eating all those fries in the beginning.   Our waiter made it up by getting us desserts on the house. I'm not much of a big dessert person (don't have a sweet tooth) just 1-2 bite and I'm done, but felt like its a waste if we didn't get it.   When there is a legitimate issue, we brought it to the assigned waiter's attention, he tried his best to resolve it. However, to tip off the scale of how our night went, the manager (this young guy dressed professionally in a gray suit) was walking around, he looked at us and did not approach us all night. Meh, not nice. BUT WHEN HE APPROACHED OUR ADJACENT NEIGHBOR TO APOLOGIZE THAT THEY GOT THE WRONG ORDER - I couldn't help but feel that was a little  messed up.    That's when we felt that the restaurant failed us. If there was an error to our order bc GORDON RAMSEY WAS SCREAMING IN THE KITCHEN AND THE BILL WAS ON THE HOUSE, then we would be fine with that. But nope, none of that happened!  Will I come back again? Nope. I'll stick with in-n-out burger, which never disappoints me.  Gordon Ramsey also said that one of the first things he eats when he goes to California is In-n-out. I think he likes it better than his own BurGR haha"}
{"text":"Amazing! Simply amazing!! The food is great. We had the onion rings for an app plus the farm burger and the fish and crisp sandwich for our entrees. The service was great! Must go!"}
{"text":"Pretty good!! Got the chicken burger with some fries and the pork bao for an appetizer!! Chicken was nice and moist; also it was well seasoned. Good burger joint"}
{"text":"This place has horrible service!!! Horrible service!!!!! I didn't even enjoy my food because I was angry at the services we got! Not one waitress or waitor asked if we had our food. We we're the very first person in line and everyone else behind us got served. Then when we finally waived at the waitor to get attention and not one time they mentioned they will make the meals complimentary or at least one of them! Why the he'll did we have to mention first and to speak about the damn issue. Then the worst part is, while we we're waiting, we saw one of the workers eating people order! The meal would be good if you had great customer service. Never coming back again!"}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant after reading comments on yelp and I wasn't disappointed. Great service and great burgers at a reasonable price. The waitress did an awesome job guiding us through the menu and the beverage selection. The burgers were cooked as ordered and the selection itself was nice.  Definitely a place to stop if you're looking for good honest food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Has to be the best burger I have had.  The jalapeño poppers were very good as well.     The attention to detail and the staff's professionalism was Excellent.  The only bad thing I could find is the noise level in the restraunt was a bit loud, but being open on all sides to a Vegas casino you expect that.   I would recommend this to anyone looking for a casual meal."}
{"text":"Awesome burger!! This place was WAY better then most of food we had while in Vegas. The Gooey Fries were soooo good! I would recommend this for lunch, anyone who wants a great lunch and doesn't want to risk paying $60 on a crappy buffet.  More than enough food for your money."}
{"text":"Awesome.   Came with a group of 15.  We tried the jalapeno poppers, onion rings and wings for appetizers.  They were all great, and came with outstanding dipping sauces.  I had the Euro burger - rare.  It was cooked perfectly, and the quality of the meat was outstanding.  Also tried the truffle fries - wonderful.  The wait was pretty long, but when it's a Sat night in Vegas at a really great place to eat, that's to be expected.  The staff was very friendly, and the service was really good.  It's not fine dining, but it is as delicious as you're going to get.  As my cousin (a CIA grad) who was with me said, there's nothing better to eat than a great burger.  This was a great burger!"}
{"text":"Are here by recommendation from a friend that said the burgers here were world-class. The way the burgers are prepared and the level of service were very unique, a few of us friends went out to dine here and enjoyed the atmosphere. The wait times can be long to get in so make sure you have a reservation or a lot of extra time on your hands. The jalapeno poppers were a lot of fun"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! We came to Vegas for 4 days and are here twice! The best burger I have ever had. I had the American and my husband had Britannia. Anything on menu was great! Jalapeño poppers we're incredible and so were truffle fries. It's worth the wait!!! Highly recommend trying best burger on strip!"}
{"text":"High end burger joint.  Good food but fries are not not included as part of the (overpriced) entree. You need to pay extra ($8-10) for fries on top of your burger of choice ($15-18). I would rather pay $20 and be guaranteed both, as per normal burger shop arrangements.  Gordon Ramsey is everywhere in their branding and looks down approvingly like big brother. If you weren't convinced that Ramsey is an egomaniac, you now will be."}
{"text":"Good food. Portions are good size. We had fries as appetizer, burger and fish sandwich. The fries were ok, it was large cut fries and we prefer thin fries. Burger was ordered medium but came out on the well done side, so ask about the temp when you order. Fish sandwich was huge, but had lots of crust. Loved the shoe string potato chip/fries on top."}
{"text":"Great service. Knowledgeable, attentive, fast, and friendly.  I ordered the chicken sliders and they were perfect. The chicken was breaded and perfectly fried while keeping the inside super moist. Loved the toasted sesame seed buns too. Co-worker had the hells kitchen burger and said it was amazing. Side of fries were a big soggy and disappointing though. Came with two different kinds of ketchup so that was cool."}
{"text":"Had the Hells Kitchen burger, beat burger I've ever had hands down. Good beer selection too, though I do wish it was a little more well rounded and offered a stout, a porter and a barleywine. But what they did have was pretty good.  There was a bit of a wait to get in, but it moved pretty quickly. Once we were seated the service was stellar. Our waitress Tammy was great. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've idolized the man on TV for such a long time but I had never stepped foot in a GR branch until BurGR. I was ready to spend at least $20 on some kind of burger considering the fact that it's coming from the mind of Gordon freakin' Ramsay. It's a restaurant I will think about eating at every time I'm in Vegas. Very modern feel. There does tend to be a line outside, but it moves faster than you think.  I actually never crave burgers and would prefer so many other foods over burgers. This review might be extremely biased but I fangirled hard and I still can't deny the cohesiveness of my experience. I thought the burgers were going to be small, maybe the size of Umami's burgers, but they were bigger than expected. We requested to have our burgers cut in half for sharing purposes, my friend had ordered the Farm Burger (which has an egg in it), the waitress came back and said the chef refused to cut it in half due to the desire of proper presentation - at first I thought it was silly but I actually loved that about the restaurant. Not only is the quality of food amazing, the presentation and service is well thought out.. even if it's for burgers - a type of food that's made to eat messily.    I had to stick with a classic Hell's Kitchen burger (medium rare). The taste of the roasted peppers actually made me smile. The meat was so soft and juicy, it practically melted in my mouth, and the sesame bun is pretty and tasteful. Thinking about it makes me crave a BurGR burger right now. We also ordered truffle parmesan fries and the beer battered maui onion rings. The fries I can live without (almost typical), but those onion rings are definitely the best onion rings I've ever tasted by far - I usually never order onion rings, either. My onion ring experience had always been stringy, crumby and just not that satisfying before I tried the ones here.   Pair your entire meal with a good old brew and you've got a great burger experience in the heart of the strip."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I've never had a tastier burger. As soon as I bit in to it, I could taste that the meat had been perfectly seasoned and was cooked just as I had ordered. The sweet potato fries were lightly dusted with powdered sugar ( I know right!!) and were served with a lime/jalepeno aoli. Very tasty!! Too polish off my meal, I had a banana shake topped with butterscotch pudding and served with a snicker doodle cookie!! Yum-me!!!!!  The service was terrific as well. Constantly checking back with us on how our meal was. Always smiling. While we didn't have to wait, when we left there was quite a line and I've seen extensive lines here before. Try to get here during off times if you can.  Lastly, the price was not bad either for a famously renown chef's restaraunt. If you can, get a rewards card from the Planet Hollywood Casino. It helped us save $5 on our food orders."}
{"text":"Holy mother of fucking earth!  One of the best burgers I've ever had. I can't get over how delicious the burgers are here and the pork belly sliders are ridiculously out of this world.  My review does no justice for this place you must come check it out for yourself.  Staff  is very friendly and attentive, nice decor, and the service is fast.  I will be coming back that's for sure.."}
{"text":"I have to choose the right place for hamburgers since my better half love them so much again thanks to Dora B we came to this place !  They were super pack thats a good sign .  Wings to start and shared a hamburger with their truffle fries . It was great those fries were great and they were also on point with the refills and checking on us .  Gosh gotta love amazing customer service and with Amazing food"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food, but i believe the stars for me were their milk shakes I have had a lot of milk shakes but i have never had a milk shake like the ones you get here, they are so creamy and thick. Plus they mix the shakes with different puddings and creme brûlée. So as you can see from the various pics posted. The glass on the top has a sugary biscuit, followed by pudding and milk shake at the bottom. Also the serving size on the fries is big enough to share between 3 ppl and are really hot (so be careful) and good. Cant wait to go back here. Cheers"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  We chose the House special \"Hells a Kitchen\" burger with truffle fries.  For dessert we had the Creme brûlée milkshake. Wow was it good. We had no reservations, wait was 45 minutes on Thursday night.  If there are any negatives I could think, it's the tables and small chairs, I mean seriously, I thought I was a guest at Hobbit Nation.  I mean really, I felt that I at 6 ft tall needed a booster seat.  Food was excellent thus 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious burger and sweet potato fries. Mine had the mango chutney which was a little sweet for me, but it was still delicious. I would recommend this place if you want a really good burger with a variety of cheeses they come with."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! My bf and I loved it so much we came here for dinner both nights we were in Vegas! We were in the mood for burgers so we stopped here before heading out for the night! Both nights we were seated with no wait.... And the service was great! The waitress and waiter we had were super friendly and so great! They checked on us frequently, refilled our water and asked us if we wanted more drinks! Based on their recommendations we ordered the euro burger, which has goat cheese, arugula, oven roasted tomato and truffle aioli sauce. It was delicious I have to say! Very rich in flavor, the goat cheese and arugula gave it a nice touch! The night before I tried the Hell's Kitchen burger (asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado and oven roasted tomatoes). This burger was also great, with a nice added kick from the jalapeños! But the avocado was nice and creamy to counter the spice! We also ordered the truffle Parmesan fries, which we shared. These were the best fries, hands down! Steak cut fries with shredded Parmesan and aioli sauce... Provided with their special aioli sauce and house made ketchup! Definitely recommend trying them! And lastly, for dessert we got the Oreo Shake with the creme brûlée pudding....OMG  it was amazing! The pudding was delicious and the Oreo Shake below it was so good!  Sadly we had missed Gordon Ramsey in house when he came an hour before we stopped in for the one year anniversary of BurGR with a large burger Cake! So cool!  Burgers range from 14-17$ so be prepared to spend a bit and the fries are extra (11 bucks, normal fries are 8 but the portions are large enough to share!). And they have a good drink selection and beer selection is also good, with 7$ draughts!  Overall, expect to pay about 30 dollars per person before tip and taxes, but it is Vegas and TOTALLY worth it! Definitely my favorite burger I've had so far!!!"}
{"text":"A month ago, we decided to go try Chef Ramsay's Burgers. Definitely one of dee BEST food that I ever ate in my life! THIS IS FREAKIN' AMAZING!!! The first thing I noticed is Chef Ramsay's face on the menu. It made me laugh because his expression is hilarious. Idk that's just me hehe. The food here is definitely expensive for sure; of course, that's what do you expect from a michelin star chef ;) When I ate the hamburgers, I noticed how well the meat is cooked, how tasty and flavorful the hamburger bun was, and droolss. I'm in hamburger heaven!!! :D The fries were also delicious and it comes with two different kind of sauces. I like how seasoned the fries are. Oh and did I mention about the shake? OMG. So good! There's like a cookie on top of the pudding, which layers above the actual chocolate shake. It's very creamy and smooth compared to the all of the milkshakes that I ever tried. There's no sign of ice and chunks of chocolate; it's pretty much well-done. WOW. There should be more restaurants like this in the bay area!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent on the whole, but Gordon, skin on the chips? Really? Thought you knew better than that!  The service however was very poor, asked staff twice for malt vinegar and ended up finishing our food before it arrived! Then, despite asking for the check several times, still took longer for it to arrive than it took to eat our food!  Bit of a let down Gordon, suffice to say we won't be recommending your place to any of our friends!"}
{"text":"Just when you think, \"What could you possibly do to a burger to make it better than other places?\" you eat here.   On a recent trip to Las Vegas I walked into the Planet Hollywood and noticed the Gordon Ramsay Burgr restaurant which has been on my bookmark list for a while so I decided to try it out! I have to admit that I am happy I came here. I swear I was able to experience \"THE\", best burger experience I ever tasted and possibly ever will. First let me say I love Burgers and I am always in search of the Best of the Best Burger. Living in California there are always Burger wars in search of what and where is the Best Burger especially in the East Bay area (Northern California) which I have tried most of them and agree with some and not so much with others.   But, I have to say, I have now experienced the absolute Best Burger of all time and in my opinion it will be hard to ever replace this Burger from my Top Number 1 position. Perhaps it could be the Best Burger in the USA ok, maybe in the World. Yes, I am Serious.   I was able to experience the Hell's Kitchen Burger and OMG, ORGASMIC! I know, I know it was a Burger, but you have to understand it absolutely was and is THE Best Burger. The reviews about this burger are off the wall so I highly recommend and suggest if you get the chance, try it and you will be pleasantly amazed. It was ecstasy and a Burger Lovers must try. To sum it up, Perfection Simply Perfection!!!!  Variety and taste are amazing. Wow. Even the bun is good. Yes, I could even eat just the bun that is how good they are; perfectly seasoned, cooked to perfection, and just nice to look at. Did I mention the truffle parmesan fries I had? They were delicious, crispy and fresh tasting.  NOW...I can't lie...The Lines can be long so get there early. I like that if you are a party less than 2 then you can cut the line and sit at the bar if anything bigger then be prepared to stay in the long line!  When it comes to pricing, I think the burger was around $14 and that is just the burger, fries or whatever are extra. The staff were very attentive and compared to casino prices the bill was not painful.  This place is a must go to if in Vegas for a burger. This meal was worth every penny.   BTW: $1 off if you have a totals rewards card! Yay baybee!"}
{"text":"Let's start from the start over an hour wait which is lame but for Vegas a busy weekend plus it being owned by Ramsey its know. To be busy. However when I wait then another 35 minutes for my food and get my onion rings after I finish my burger is totally unacceptable. Burger was a solid 10 sevic was a solid 1."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, what with Gordon Ramsay's face plastered on all the print advertisements on the Vegas Strip and all.  In short - it was okay. Food was okay. The Farm Burger I ordered was just an overpriced, average burger with a fried egg in the middle. The burger was small, especially considering how pricey this place is. We shared the truffle fries with everyone, and they were just that - simply fries.   Thankfully we went right when it opened on Saturday morning, so there was no wait at all. If I waited as long as the other reviewers had (1-2 hours?!), I might have thrown a fit.. I would much rather save the money from this meal for a buffet.  In-N-Out is way better. Too bad there's none on the strip in Vegas. :("}
{"text":"Tried this place out awhile back with the family.    Service: The upside was that we got seated relatively quick.  Though as soon as we got seated, it was pretty slow service after that which is surprising since it wasn't packed at the time we came in.  Felt like all the servers were just chilling/hiding to gossip and whatnot instead of attending to their customers.  Price/Taste:  I honestly forgot what burger I got here but I do remember sharing with the siblings.  Personally do remember feeling that the burgers were overpriced for the quality.  It's better then fast food burgers, but not up there compared to other dine in burger joints. Maybe this place was just too hyped up.  Well at least we tried right?  Truffle fries, shoot. I'll get truffle fries anywhere, any day, regardless of price (which actually was decently priced for the amount they give out).  Honey-Pig Bao Buns:  I've had better elsewhere.  Wasn't too special.  Where I come from, we can get this left and right but if it's something that you haven't tried before, I'd say go for it.  Overpriced and probably not something I'd get again.  Overall: It was an experience. I ate and conquered. The end."}
{"text":"This place just gets worse and worse.. The line is horrendous and the food sucks here. You pay about 15-20 for mediocre burgers and fries. I came here 3x and the first time it was really good because the winner of the show was there (I forgot her name). So I came back a second time and everything tasted so bad. The food quality was way worse and even worse the third time back. Gordan Ramsy would have been freaking angry if he had to try that garbage food in his own restaurant. Not worth the wait, not worth the price, and will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best hamburgers I have ever had in my entire life. The F word burger is an absolute bomb! Aged New York with rib meat. If you go more than a medium rare you should be arrested for abuse. Next time I'm going to consider it rare it was so good."}
{"text":"I'm giving a 4/5 mostly due to the fact that the rest of my party absolutely loved this place. I'm still on the fence because I think I got the wrong burger.   To start, we all shared the Gooey Fries. While I absolutely loved how they were loaded with cheese, I'm just not a fan of steak fries. I wonder if they'd let you swap them out for sweet potato fries?  Mr. and Mrs. S shared the Truffle Burger and raved about how flavorful it was. I got the Turkey Burger because the idea of blueberry compote sounded awesome. But it had more sweetness and less tang than I was hoping for. Also, my manchego cheese wasn't melted - disappointing.   However, their crazy shakes were very interesting. Mrs. S got the coffee shake topped with hazelnut pudding and a praline cookie. She said that while the Shake was awesome, the pudding and cookie were very so-so.  Both my husband and myself got the Oreo shake topped with Creme Brûlée pudding and an Oreo. Hubby was 100% in love. I felt the shake was only decent. But that pudding was completely delicious and definitely my favorite part of the meal! I'm not particularly convinced that a shake and pudding really needed to be combined...I found myself eating them separately. But oh well. It was certainly an interesting idea.   Next time we return, I'm thinking I need to try their epic bacon-wrapped BBQ burger. That one could convince me that a 4/5 rating is accurate."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch on Saturday 8/9/14  Delicious!   The server was super friendly, nice guy from Santa Cruz (forgot his name).   We got 4 appetizers because they all sounded amazing! They were!! Chicken wings, poppers, bao, onion rings...I would eat them all right now again!  And the burgers, oh the burgers between us we got the two chicken burgers,  the spicy burger, and and I forgot the last one.  They were all amazing!  Great food, great service, great time!  Only one complaint,  there's a line out front DO NOT GET IN LINE! Check in at the host stand...stood in line for 15 minutes for nothing...they should get rid of that line."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a while.  Burgers are huge.  Their shakes are like a meal on its own.  I would recommend getting the shakes after your meal or else you'll be too full to enjoy the burger."}
{"text":"My friends and I joked that this meal changed our lives but I might just be serious.   Honestly, BEST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD! And I don't even like red meat. I also highly recommend the Parmesan Truffle Fries."}
{"text":"a bit over rated !! The burger it self is very good, but it comes alone on a plate.. You have to order fries separately!!!!!! Reallyyy???!!!neve heard of burger with no fries!!! It is like asking for pizza with no cheese on top  We were lucky to come at a quite time so we didn't need to stand in line to get a seat!!! I'll wouldn't say no to this place but don't have to much expectation"}
{"text":"Yes. I love burgers. I love good burgers. This is the place to get good burgers. Service was decent and friendly Wait wasn't too bad actually - spent most of our time in line just goofing off. Me, thinking of Gordon Ramsay...haha.  Burger patty was perfect! Loved the chantrelle mushroom burger...moist and just enough savory to it.   One of the ketchup sauces had too much vinegar in it.  I recommend getting two totally different styles of burgers and splitting with whoever you're with. ...Who doesn't do that though? ;P  I would like to come back!"}
{"text":"Great! First off the service is on point.   I ordered the Farm Burger (duck bacon and fried egg) and its full of flavor and cooked perfectly!   I'd recommend ordering your burger cooked a bit less than normal. The meat is ground so it tastes differently. Usually get burgers medium but it already made the meat a bit too tough for me. Will go with medium rare next time I come!  The truffle fries are amazing! The truffle sauce and house made ketchup are delicious also. Definitely don't skip out on the fries!"}
{"text":"Loved this so much! Very modern and fun for a burger place. Ordered the sweet potato fries for an appetizer... *mic drop* the burgers are delicious. Best chicken burger i have ever had. I wanted to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I bloody love Ramsey so naturally I had to try this place out. Being a local I somewhat dread coming to the strip because of the long lines and overly priced food but this place definitely made up for it. Yes the burger was expensive for what it was, but wow it was delicious! And the wait ended up being not too bad, around 25-30 minutes for a party of four on a Tuesday night.   Food wise my boyfriend and I split the euro burger and onion rings. The goat cheese on the burger is really what sealed the deal for me and the whole thing was cooked perfectly. The onion rings were great too. I really enjoyed the thick breading and ranch type dipped sauce. The one draw back was the sprinkled cheese on top since I'm not a huge cheese fan. Overall very good quality and worth the premium pricing.   The service was great too which is usually expected in the heart of the strip. Our waitress was very attentive and offered her suggestions on the menu. I must say I was too keen on the outfits though, I would have appreciated a more upscale look as compared to Twin Peaks but eh guess that's Vegas for ya. In the end I'm glad I came here and would recommend this place to burger lovers world wide."}
{"text":"I came here this weekend on a Saturday for dinner. Arrived at 5:30pm to avoid the dinner rush. We made it just in time, because for a party of 3, we only waited about 10 minutes for a table, while groups that arrived immediately after us had wait times of 15-30 minutes. It's good that they take the phone numbers of parties that have wait any longer than that though, so they can go roam the strip until they get texted that their table is ready.   I tried the Farm Burger, Truffle Parmesan Fries, and the Shake #5, which was a coffee milkshake with sticky toffee pudding.   The Farm Burger was delicious, although it was a little messy to eat. The yoke of the egg kind of just bursts out, which is absolutely delicious, but it does get all over your hands while you take bites of the burger.  The Truffle Fries were a little expensive, but definitely worth the taste. The combination of the fresh parmesan and truffle aioli made it all the better. The portion was pretty big, and can be shared among 3-4 people.  The milkshake was delicious. I usually don't like milkshakes because I get tired of the sweetness, but the combination of the shake and pudding made the taste a lot more bearable for me. The shake was sweet, but not overbearingly so, and the pudding was light and not all too sweet. The cookie on top was great too!  I think anyone looking for a good burger should check it out. It's often pretty busy during peak meal hours, but if you go just before or after, it should be okay. Even if there is a line though, you can gamble in the casino or go shopping in miracle mile ;) The waiting service was also great! My friend ordered a Raspberry Tea, and every time it got even close to low, our waitress would come around with another one! Gordon Ramsay did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"My burger was pretty amazing and the rest of the menus looked pretty darn good too. Burger is in top 5 I've ever had and place was a lot cheaper than expected. Overall I recommend with two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The waiting line to this place was really, really long, like 40 minutes long. Fortunately we had a friend with us, who helped us skip the queue and go straight to the table. Otherwise, I don't thing we would have enough time to eat there. The decor was kind of more modern American diner style. Lots of red, yellow and orange. Not really my style. The service was great, especially my male friends thought so, as they hire only really nice and pretty ladies :).   I ordered Damnation Chicken Burger and Truffle Parmesan Fries and Jack with coke. The burger was very original in taste and simply one of the best burgers I ever had. Certainly, it was the best chicken burger I ate. I order them sometimes, when I want something more light, but usually they have a very mild taste. People just don't know how to make them right. But it was not the case here. Chicken, fiery hot mayo, maytag blue cheese, celery and carrot slaw may seem like a very bland combination, but I assure you, it was great. And the truffle parmesan fries were the highlight of the meal. Great taste! Waaay better than normal fries. I don't really remember what my companions ordered, but it was all very meaty - beef and bacon and stuff. They were also very happy with their meal. I also tried Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops but they were nothing special and not really worth mentioning. The burgers were big for a girl like me, but for my companions it was probably just enough. Although if you add fries, I don't think you could walk out hungry. The prices are probably high for that kind of food, but with comparison to other Vegas venues, still pretty bearable. If you don't mind waiting for your food, you definitely should try this place!"}
{"text":"Overall - 3/5 Food quality - 2.5/5 - Hit or Miss - some items are good, some are way below average Ambience - 3/5 - I am not sure what, but something about the inside of the restaurant makes it feel extremely busy, hard to relax at a setting like this one. It's OK, and since this resto is competing with the best of the best in Vegas, my take on ambience was jus meh .. Shakes - 4.5/5 - Yum Service - 2/5 - Very average service for those prices; service is just like any damn gastropub where you'd get a burger for ~$9. Come on guys, you are promoting yourselves as a top notch burger joint and you've gotta do better than that on service.  Factors of annoyance - Huge (I mean insane) Wait Times .. I can understand the line outside, but taking over 50 mins for 1 chicken burger and 1 fish sandwich is WAY too much, I don't care how busy your resto is.. In sum, not at all pleased with this place, can't see myslef going back here especially when there are options galore in Vegas ..."}
{"text":"Had the Farm Burger (friend egg - Australian style). The meat itself was cooked a perfect medium. Fresh bun, and nicely spiced ketchup. The regular fries were great as well, and a nice selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"It was great, not a big fan of having to purchase fries cuz it doesn't with the burger. The Burger was awesome! bun was perfect. The burger patty was alittle burnt on one side. tho I like that. Its a must go if you love burgers when you are in Vegas. The only reason Its 4 Stars, I asked for ranch with my fries, didnt get it. asked again when they brought the food, didnt get it. asked the server again, didnt get it. Manager was walking the tables I asked her, STILL DIDNT GET IT. $15 for the Farm Burger and  $8 for fries. My wife got the American Burger."}
{"text":"Solid burger joint, but nothing to wait in line for.  The ketchup was too thick and rich.  I would guess it was made in-house."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch based on yelp reviews. The poppers were very good. The urber cheese burger was delicious. The truffle fries a definite must  great device and plenty of TVs for game days.  A bit pricey but you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Tell me what the rave is about? 45 min wait in line and we dominated the burgers within minutes. I ordered the damnation burger which was chicken and dilled pickles with lettuce wrap. It was more or less a protein burger. The flavor wasn't great, and was disappointed. My boyfriend ordered the euro burger and it was much more flavorful.    If you go, order beef burgers, it looks big, but it's because of the bun. The service wasn't bad I suppose, quite nice and burgers did take awhile to get to us. They mentioned that they make everything as orders are placed to ensure freshness. Ok, I give you that.  But will I return? Um..not likely and I'd try other burger places on the strip. For the wait, cost, and taste? No.."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We've tried a few of RAmseys other restaurants and couldn't wait to come try this one in Vegas. Location is great, staff was so friendly and helpful.   The chicken burger was wonderful, even tho the bartender told me it wasn't a real burger, I would recommend it. -_____-  Husband had a \"real\" burger and we got the Parmesan fries as well as the hot peppers. Go! The price was right too!!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey is our favorite celebrity chef right now and you cannot go anywhere in Las Vegas without seeing his face on a billboard for one of his restaurants.  We've been wanting to try BURGR for a while now, and decided to eat there tonight. The ambiance was great: buzzing with people and large screen TVs while to watch while we waited.  Our server gave us an iPad to order drinks, and after realizing it was not working properly, gave us another one to review the drink menu. Much to our dismay, the iPad was more of an electronic menu then a tool for us to order from.   I opted for a shake instead of an alcoholic beverage, and decided to share it with my sister who is underage. When the server returned and took our order, I asked if we could split the shake as I have seen it done in pictures on Yelp. Her reply was \"NO\". Not an, \"I can bring you an extra cup\" just a straight up, NO. Rude.   The wait time was a bit long, and our shake (that could not be split) came right before our food did. The other members in our party were already on their second round of drinks. Didn't see much of our waitress between ordering and the end of our meal.  Other servers replenished our drinks and brought our food. The food was amazing, and the ingredients were put together in such a unique way that made everything taste interesting and delicious. If not for the food, this rating would have been a one star.   The bill was presented with an outdated iPod that gave us a survey and an opportunity to rate the restaurant. We were honest in our opinions, giving the service a C- and the food an A. The bad service was disappointing but did not put a damper on our night at the strip. At the end of the night I just couldn't help but think....would Gordon Ramsey approve?!"}
{"text":"Do not know what  the rave is about with these burgers. I had a burger yesterday in Vegas and I ate the most horrible burger ever. I asked the girl for a simple burger, nothing hot and she assured me that there was nothing hot on anything, asked for no ketchup, no pickles and no mustard. Burger came with everything I requested not to put on it. I asked for well done and it came mediam well. Extra dry fries. She served it and never came back, sent a cowoerker with 2 extra sodas and said she was busy. Never will ever enter this business again. Rip off."}
{"text":"So delicious and worth the not outrageous 35 minute wait. I had the chanterelle burger medium rare. The beef was flavourful and juicy. It had just the right amount of pinkness inside. Loved the truffle fries. I'm not a cheese fan (sacrilege I know!) but I enjoyed the salty, savouriness of this. Bonus was that they let us bring in and drink the frozen takeaway cocktails that we got from another store while we were waiting for our table!"}
{"text":"Arrived in Vegas and was starving, which means I needed a burger. Naturally pulled out Yelp and found BurGR not too far away. And as a burger fanatic, this place still stands as the greatest burger I have ever had. I had the Hells Kitchen Burger, which is a must for those who like Jalepenos on their burgers. Absolutely incredible. The Sweet Potato fries are also the best I've ever had. If I could pick this place up and bring it with me, I would. A must first stop for those looking for a meal after arriving in Vegas."}
{"text":"To start this place made me realize I like ketchup or at least theirs.  I had the über cheese which was definitely the best burger ever.  It was the best grilled cheese sandwich on top of the best buger.  The boyfriend had the blue burger.  This is that item knocked the score down a star.  This might be the fault of a burger place at home where they have an equally amazing maytag blue cheese burger.  If this was our first time having maytag it would be a 5."}
{"text":"what to order: farm burger, chicken wings, truffle fries tip: waiting isn't so bad with the texting system, go drink & gamble!  went with 4 of my friends on a Saturday afternoon after dayclub. I like the way their seating is set up, you tell the hostess how many, they quote you a time & they send you a text when the table is ready. we were sat within 30min!   we ordered: jalapeño poppers, chicken wings, truffle fries and the farm burger.   the chicken wings were surprisingly really good!! I liked them better than the jalapeño poppers, which were a little too mushy and I didn't like the sauce. I really liked the truffle fries too!  the farm burger was really good but I wished they had a side or the option of lettuce, onion and tomatoes.. I was too full to ask. the burger was too heavy on the protein side, it was lacking that fresh taste you get from the vegetables and ketchup.  I would definitely come back and try other burgers, the burger party meat was so juicy!"}
{"text":"Leave it to Gordon Ramsay to create the BEST vegetarian \"burger\" ever! Delicious. The peanut butter dessert was the perfect ending to a meal I'll be craving until next time...   And thank you to our wonderful waiter, Sergio!"}
{"text":"The hells kitchen burger was alright. The hog burger was worse. At 17 dollars, even though its on the strip, i expect my socks to be blown off. I have had way better burgers for a fraction of the price made in a food truck. Not impressed with the regular fries, sweet potato fries, or truffle fries. Sliders were decent. I would like to think a restaurant by Gordon Ramsey could beat a hole in the wall burger joint in Texas but sadly it falls way short. The two times Ive ate here the only thing thing that is in my mind is, \"Ive had better\"."}
{"text":"The menu is well balanced with several tasty sounding appetizers and maybe a dozen burger choices, they have chicken burgers and turkey burgers too if that's your style, as well as a few salads. It's a simple menu and not overwhelming at all which is great, sometimes we are offered so any choices it's hard to pick.   We ordered the chicken slider appetizer, with a Farmer's burger and a Hells Kitchen burger. The appetizer was pretty big for a slider and came with two. The chicken was fried which was a surprise but the flavors were pretty great. We didn't even finish our appetizer and the burgers arrived. The burgers come with nothing and we skipped fries because they're like $10 and no basket of fries is worth $10.   Alright so to be honest this burger was very well cooked, very juicy and fresh, and the flavor was there but it wasn't anything profound. My burger came with no condiments and they don't provide any, so it ended up my bun was just a little dry. The Hell's Kitchen had a sort of pesto sauce and some avocado to provide some sort of moisture to go with the bun and worked nicely, but still the flavor was just a little lackluster. My biggest issue that really just ruined this for me was the temperature of the entire burger. It was barely warm. I want a nice HOT burger. The meat, the bun and everything inside had dramatically cooled down by the time we got it and it just was an instant boner killer. I don't think I would come back, the price of the burger doesn't reflect in the value we received. There are better burgers at a cheaper price point. However I will say, that our server was really great. If I could, I'd give this place 3.5 stars. The food is quick and overall very tasty, the service was top notch and the menu options are pleasing to everyone. Attaching the name Gordon Ramsay you expect a memorable experience, unfortunately we left slightly dissatisfied."}
{"text":"For a moderately priced option on the strip this would be hard to beat. First the downsides, was an hour wait, but it was Saturday night, and with people watching on the strip, the mall, or throwing money away at the casino you can find someway to spend the hour doing. I got a hotdog and the rest of my party talked crap because I didn't get a burger, but joke was on them when it came out, crazy delicious, bun overstuffed with cheese and peppers, ridiculous. But the best thing we got were the sweet potato fries, I really don't think I can ever order them from anywhere else, because they just won't measure up"}
{"text":"Fabulous.  That was amazing food.  We had the Maui onion rings, American burger, Farm burger and Gooey fries.  Everything was delicious.  Service was great, very prompt and attentive.  We probably only waited about 15 minutes for a table and that was during prime lunch hours.  Would definitely return if we lived closer."}
{"text":"After watching all of Gordon Ramsey's tv shows, I had high expectations for Burgr.   We tried the Farm Burger which had the duck bacon and the egg. I normally put egg in most of my sandwiches so it would make it more rich. But with that, the burger was bland.  the burger definitely needed cheese or something salty to balance out the neutral taste of an egg (like how eggs always need salt/pepper, soy sauce). For me the flavor of the burger was lacking in that department. I rarely say it but it def needed a tad more sodium :/   My group shared order of sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries.   Truffle Parmesan Fries: I was expecting to love this but it was soggy and a bit colder than fries should be. I was disappointed that it was so soggy. and the flavors did not seem to come through for me. I barely detected any truffle.   Sweet Potato fries: I was pleasantly surprised by how flavorful these fries were! The vanilla powdered sugar really boosted the flavor of the sweet potato! It was scrumptious and I normally don't like sweet potato fries very much. :] MUST try this!  All in all, for the price, it's still pretty hefty for a burger but it's vegas. :/ I would definitely try something different the next time I come here."}
{"text":"Got the Soba Noodle Chicken Salad - It was great - A spicy sriracha chicken, edamame, carrots, cucumber, avocado, sesame seeds, and the cilantro-honey-peanut dressing wrapped everything up the buckwheat noodles nicely. The dish contained a lot of pasta compared to the amount of chicken - would of loved more sriracha chicken.  The sweet potato fries were great - comes with more powered sugar and a warm jalapeno aioli dipping sauce. The best!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this but huge disappointment. It gets 3 stars because the waitress did everything she could to make our experience better. The hostesses saw us in line and pretended not to seat us for 10 minutes because they were leaving. Add 10 more minutes of waiting because the new hostesses decided to chat with the outgoing ones. 5 minutes later we get seated. We order two burgers  a beer and a soda. We go our drinks fast but it took them 28 minutes to get our burgers done. In addition, I noticed that the couples that were in front and behind us in line were eating 10 minutes prior.  The burger were cooked to our liking, but Ive had better.  It was an indication that I wasn't coming back for sure.  You notice how they always take time to bring your food but your bill they bring quikly?"}
{"text":"A very good but, the most expensive burger I have ever had. The restaurant was very nice and had a neat theme. I gave BuRGr four stars for the fact the the food was good and the cool experience. $48 for two beers and a burger with a side of fries. Wow!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the farm burger and it was one of the best (if not the best) burgers I've ever had. Seriously perfect in every way. The sweet potato fries with honey mayo were amazing as well, and one order of fries was plenty to share for two people. Gordon Ramsay himself was at the restaurant when I was there and he was nice enough to take pictures with the guests :) I would definitely return next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"3.5  Farmhouse burger was cooked more like a strong medium vs the requested medium rare. Patty was a little under seasoned. Bun held together well. Best part were the order of onion rings and fries. I think I prefer Holsteins."}
{"text":"\"Bloody hell! You can't even cook a burger properly!\"  After a visit to BurGR, I have lost so much respect for the hardball, no BS when it comes to food and service celebrity Chef Ramsey. BurGR at Planet Hollywood was actually quite a joke. I can't believe Chef would put his name on an establishment that has less than stellar service, BIG problems in the kitchen, rundown décor, and honestly marginal food.    The joint: No reservations, so be prepared to wait in line. It appeared long; however, moved quickly. The restaurant space is jam packed with tables (seriously...elbow room only), so tables steadily open up. BurGR is \"well worn.\"  I can understand a little wear and tear here and there, but the placemats were tattered, cloth napkins were faded, plates had half of what used to be the BurGr logo on them, and the painted floors were worn down to the concrete in several areas...definitely in need of a face lift.   Now onto THE important part - the FOOD: Husband had the Farm Burger with Duck Breast Bacon, sharp English cheddar cheese, topped with a soft fried egg.  I ordered the Euro Burger with truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomatoes.  Side order of \"Just Fries\" served in a large metal cone with curry and chipotle ketchups.   Where to start? Food was delivered...\"stone cold.\" Hubby's burger had died in the window, glaringly obvious by the congealed cheddar cheese and hard cooked ice cold (like cold from the fridge) egg. Mine burger was room temp at best. And, despite the fact that we each ordered different cook temps on our burgers (medium and med-well, respectively) they both arrived well-done.  We informed the waitperson (very lovely gal) and she offered to re-order. We were already an hour and a half in and had plans so we declined.    The General Manager, Joana Holtey, came to our table - offered a re-order...again \"no thanks.\" She was very apologetic. Thirty seconds later Joana returned with another egg on a plate...that was COLD. Haha Obviously, they are precooking eggs in the kitchen. Ridiculous! Two minutes later Joana delivered a perfectly cooked fresh egg...by then half the burger had been eaten.  Two comp beers to go and the offer to return and give another comp try were much appreciated, but sadly the damage had already been done and we had other plans for the rest of the week.   I think it's important to note that BurGR might have been having a particularly bad night. Prior to us ordering, we had a conversation with the couple sitting next to us about the issues they had with the Farm Burger - same over-cooked, cold egg. They sent theirs back 3 times and eventually just left without eating. Two people sitting behind us, three people sitting to the left us, and one person at the table in front of us all sent plates back. Wowza! And, that's just what we noticed in our little area of the restaurant. Not good Gordie! Not good at all! I'm going to heed the same order you so often give during \"Hell's Kitchen\" and tell myself to \"F*&^ OFF!\"...only this person won't be coming back. So disappointed.  Oh, I almost forgot - there was a person walking around the restaurant offering to take group photos for sale. Really?! Tacky!"}
{"text":"I have ate a lot of burgers in my life, but I have to take my hat off to Mr Ramsay.  We ate there twice while in Vegas and both times the burgers were amazing. The flavors are unique and the seasoning helps you remember why Gordon is so good at what he does. I love this place!  The one star that is missing is for the poor service from our waitress. She was too busy talking with one of the male waiters instead of taking care of the customer."}
{"text":"Slow service with over 50 minutes for two burgers from time of placing order.  Well over an hour from getting seated.  Burger was ok but not worth the trouble.  Over priced for the experience.  Last time i eat here.  Heading to IN&OUT next time."}
{"text":"Host was ok, service was very good. Food was good but to costly. Only ate here so the kids could experience it. Tkz"}
{"text":"After a 20 min wait we were seated, very fun decor in restaurant. We had an awesome server  Clark she recommended different drinks, burgers and sides. Minimal wait for drinks and food.  We ordered Euro burger, Hells Kitchen burger, onion rings and truffle fries. We were not disappointed everything was great."}
{"text":"Really. This place is average....  If you have more than 2 people, they can put on you on the list and will text you when your table is ready.   Truffle fries were awesome. Oreo and flan (or whatever it's called) is really good too!  The burger is just meh. Nothing really that great. I went to Shake Shack the very next day and thought the burger there was a lot better.   I would go somewhere else if you have to wait more than 20 minutes...just not worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"Me and my husband enjoyed this scrumptious onion rings, hell's kitchen burger and hog burger"}
{"text":"This place met all my expectation. I ordered shake that was out of this world! Creme brûlée with Oreo Shake is amazing. It is a must order on the menu. Don't forget to bring your rewards card you get a discount!  The farm burger is ohhhhh so good. The fries and onion rings is a must order I promise you will not regret it.  The server was just perfect and friendly!  Love this place and will return soon!"}
{"text":"Tourist trap alert!  Tourist trap alert!  That's what first came to mind when I dropped by to have lunch in the awkwardly-capitalized Gordon Ramsey BurGR in the Planet Hollywood hotel.  Even at 11am -- before the doors had even opened -- there was a *massive* line at the front door, wrapping along the ultra-sleek fire-and-glass exterior and extending into the casino.  My heart sank a little, since the prospect of a 3-hr wait did not appeal to me whatsoever.  The good news was the wait was only 5 minutes.  I skipped the line and went straight to the bar, which has open seating and serves the full menu.  (I recommend the bar to everyone trying to eat here.)  The interior is absolutely gorgeous, with no expense spared to make the atmosphere contemporary and hip.  Even the utensils are high-end.  The menu is long, and the portions are massive.  It's very easy for your eyes to overestimate your belly's capacity here, so choose wisely.  For lunch, I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and a side of Maui parmesan onion rings.  I was bummed at just how average they were.  The burger tasted like jalapenos and grease -- and nothing else.  I couldn't discern the beef, the cheese, nothing.  And at $14, this burger was wickedly overpriced.  I ate about half the burger before I didn't want any more.  The onion rings were better, but not by much. The crisp was nice, but the dish was underseasoned.  No salt, no pepper.  The dipping sauces helped a bit.  I preferred the aioli.  Service was fast.  Very fast.  Fast to the point that I was being rushed out of there.  I'll skip this tourist trap next time."}
{"text":"Burger was good, not great. Tried all the sauces to go with the sweet potato fries... they were all terrible! I mean, how do you mess up ketchup? $18 for a burger better be something special; far from it."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place out! First off as soon as you sit down starting ewith the menu it is already for unique.  We started off with thr jalapeno poppers that are very good and I loved the presentation.  The hummus with veggies and flatbread were very tasty.  I had the farm burger I was wanted to try somethinf different. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the duck burger was.  I jalapeno burger was also very good!  I quinoa salad was so tasty I would probaly order that next time  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Everything was very good.  The wait was maybe 20min cause they don't take reservations and were busy that night.  Also they are not the cheapest eats like this on the strip, expect to spend 100$+ for apps, mains and drinks for two adults (we didn't have dessert here).    I say all in all worth a visit, especially if you like fancy burgers."}
{"text":"The best burger on the planet. You want to hate this guy due to his celebrity status, but the man can create masterpieces with burgers. Added bonus: The sticky toffee pudding is a sinful sweet culinary delight. Gordon Ramsey is the best chef on the planet!!"}
{"text":"Four stars because I ate here twice during my vacation in Vegas, ordered the exact same thing, and it wasn't consistent. The first time it was the best burger/fries I've ever had in my whole entire life! I ordered the Uber cheeseburger and truffle fries. Cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. Couldn't stop thinking about it the whole trip so decided to eat there again before we left. The second time the burger was way too salty and the truffle fries were over cooked and dry. The service was amazing both times as everyone was super friendly. Our server said that Ramsey usually comes in once a month and is actually really nice."}
{"text":"3.5-4 stars  After spending the day at Grand Canyon West, we decided to \"swing by\" Vegas and fill our stomachs with burgers. Gordon Ramsay's BurGR had the highest rating & number of reviews, so we decided to try it. There was a long line at 6 PM on a Sunday, but it moved at a decent rate. The husband and I decided to sit by the bar since there were seats open. While they had several beer on tap, the choices were just okay.  Appetizer: 1) Fury Chicken Wings (tangy hellfire blue cheese wings; $14): we were thrown off at first because they did not resemble your typical wings, but they were so delicious! Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside and packed with all the right flavors. Definitely worth ordering if you're in the mood for wings  Entrees: 1) Hell's Kitchen Burger (asadero cheese + roasted jalapeño peppers + avocado + oven roasted tomato; $14) 2) Euro Burger (truffle aïoli + goat cheese + arugula + oven roasted tomato; $16) - the meat was just okay. I think Five guys serves better tasting meat, but they dressed the burgers up nicely. If I were to rate the burgers based on the meat, they would get 2-3 stars, but the extras on the burgers made it tasty.  (Side note: fries are extra)  The service is fast. The food is decent. The prices are a bit high, even for a gourmet burger. It's not on my top 10 burger list, but it was a decent meal."}
{"text":"Best burgers I have ever tried!!!! Waited 20 minutes to get seated. After our order waited 45 min to get our food. Service was ok. The food was worth the wait!!! Try thier sweet potato fries"}
{"text":"Went to eat here at 11pm on a friday night and the line wasn't too crazy long.  We had the jalepeno poppers, which were DELISH.  And the hell's ktichen burger, which looked huge, but was pretty manageable and tasted pretty good.  I was disappointed by the chili dog..the size of it wasn't disappointment but the taste. It was SUPER salty.    Decor was nice too.  If you're a Total Rewards member, you basically get $1 off everything on their menu.  And the staff there were super friendly."}
{"text":"All I can say is BEST burger I have ever had.   I ordered the euro burger and it was so good it was hard to believe I was eating a burger. It was just so good, I also had a side of onion rings. Just a heads up the onion rings or gigantic.   My bf has the hells burger with a side of Parmesan/truffle fries which he also loved.  The price was a little high but my burger was well worth it."}
{"text":"Sat at the counter rather than waiting for a table. My fiancé and I got to witness the amazingness of the kitchen. I had the farm burger medium rare and she had the wings. The truffle fries are awesome and very rarely do people know how to actually cook medium rare but the chefs here nailed it! Awesome food and wonderful service! Drinks were amazing!"}
{"text":"Best burger we have EVER had!!  Truffle fries are amazing and the Oreo Shake with creme brûlée on top was the icing on the cake!"}
{"text":"Great burger place on the strip! We've been to a few celebrity chef restaurants and this is by far our favorite.  The burgers are well seasoned and full of flavor. They were cooked perfectly and the buns were soft and airy.   We originally ordered the truffle fries and didn't care for them at all. They were mushy and crumbly and somehow chewy....not good. We told the waiter we didn't like them and he offered to bring something else, so we opted for the onion rings. The onion rings were delicious!! Seriously the best I've ever had. The outside was nice and crispy while the onion was tender. They were full of great flavor. I'd come back just for those.  To finish the meal we had the sticky toffee pudding pops....AMAZING! I'm a huge sticky toffee pudding fan so of course I loved it. The salted peanut ice cream paired well with the sticky toffee pudding. My husband devoured his too.   Overall, this was a great lunch on the strip. I would definitely come back, especially for the onion rings and sticky toffee pudding pops."}
{"text":"Stopped by and grab chicken burger again, it was good but wasn't taste as good as the last time. Next time I will have to try something else on the menu. Very helpful and friendly staffs. May be I should try out his restaurant at the Paris hotel or may be the other one at Caesar."}
{"text":"First time i ate here. The line was long and it took just over an hour for a party of 5. The cool thing was they check you in and then text you when your table is ready so you can go and wonder the casino. Not a beer person but there is a large selection. I got the Britannia burger and it was good... the mango chutney was just a sweet marmalade. I wish that fries came with the burger but if you want them they are an additional $10...a little pricey but this is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. Not really as upscale as I thought it would be.   Only reason i am giving 4 stars is cause I love Gordon Ramsey."}
{"text":"They ran out of duck breast bacon for the Farm burger on a Sunday during lunch. That was disappointing, also the egg was small. The farm burger and chanterelle burger were very good. The Pig burger was thick, juicy, and cooked perfectly, but overall seemed under-seasoned. The Parmesan  fries were good, but the ration of potato bits to whole fries was too high. Maybe we should've asked for a new order. The service was great. Overall, 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Love love love coming here when I am in Las Vegas! Everything is always all so great. Every time I have had dinner here I have never really waited for a table. It's crazy since I've usually seen such a huge line waiting to get in. Glad I didn't end up having to wait. Service was very good and on top of it. We had our refills coming very quickly, food was fast, hot and delicious. I love the Jalapeno Poppers! They are a must try! I tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was amazing! Loved every bite and was sad I couldn't finish my food since I was soo full.   Loved the quality of the food, service and ambiance.   The restaurant décor and lighting were beautiful and every bit of the place looked super clean. I will be sure to always stop by."}
{"text":"This place awesome . Not only was the burgers delicious ... But my waiter was absolutely handsome !! Lol hahaha yea I said it ... No but for real .. I order the Hell's Kitchen burger with a side a ranch . That burger literally melted in my mouth . The fries was just ok . The ketchup with spicy tho . But good . I would certainly recommend this place and get the milkshake ... Too good too pass up"}
{"text":"Love Gordon Ramsay. Had to stop at this restaurant for my 30th birthday trip to Vegas. This Hell's Kitchen burger was the best burger I've ever had. I even tried replicating it when I got home wasn't the same. The truffle fries were to die for same with their specialty ketchup and dipping sauces. Had to try a shake too and settled on the shake #5 which has hazelnut coffee and praline cookie. Best shake ever. Hard to choose from all those amazing flavors. Definitely would go back. The customer service was great too."}
{"text":"When I first saw this restaurant, I didn't know what to expect. The outside looked cool, but I thought a celebrity-themed restaurant just had the makings of a let down with a big sell and low performance. I couldn't have been more wrong. From the moment I walked up to the hostess stand, the service, food quality, and overall presentation were spectacular. The burger I ordered was cooked to perfection and stayed hot the entire time. The food is very unique (I highly recommend the Parmesan onion rings). You won't be disappointed if you like good meat and good burgers. This is on my to-do list next time I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place for a while and it did not disappoint. The cocktails were all really refreshing. Get the Jalapeño poppers! They were amazing. As were the onion rings! The fries were pretty standard.   I munched off all of my friends burgers so i got to try a lot of different ones and they were all good. Euro, Hell's Kitchen, Farm and Britannia(i think that's what it was called?). You can't really go wrong here."}
{"text":"The Yummiest burger ever had! It's called the southern yardbird burger. The chicken and pickle in it attracted me to pick it. We had fries with a tangy bbq sauce. The fries were fresh and super yummy along with the sauce. The not to forget the presentation of them- wow! A cone shaped metal cup and plate contained the fries and sauce. Then we had hummus with pita bread and veggies. Hummus was super yummy too. I licked them though. Veggies included carrots, beets, turnips, spring onions. Everything was good raw but for the green spring onions. Finally had the burger. I was tummy full by then. By the burger super yummy and warm, I just couldn't resist eating it. Stuffed myself till the last bite. I really enjoyed that chicken burger - it consisted of lettuce, chicken (with some veggies/ spices in it), pickles, honey mustard dressing (I guess). Mouthwatering right? I completely loved it. There was a long Q to this restaurant. It was super filled up. Beautiful ambience. The burger took a while to get ready, but was totally worth it."}
{"text":"Omg what an amazing restaurant. I just got done eating here and have been looking forward to this for a long time. I had the Hell's Kitchen and it was awesome. Ordered it medium and it came out perfect. Waited in line for about 45 mins but it was well worth it. Lots of tvs to watch and they had the game on, so that's a plus. Food came out relatively quickly for as busy as it was. I would totally eat here again. Wait staff was very friendly and filled my water glass when it was half empty every time. Ran the rock n roll half marathon and all of the wait staff that stopped at my table or nearby congratulated me."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for any burger with a fried egg on top.  This style is a standard in most burger places and I've tried it all over the country.  I ordered BurGR's farm burger with duck breast bacon and runny fried egg.  The burger was excellent.  The best part was the garlic spread they put on the roll.  I ordered the burger medium and it was pretty pink in the middle.  I didn't bother me but it's a warning to those who like their burgers well done (freaks!).  The only negative was that the service was slow.  I even texted my friend and told her that they must have sent the risotto back (a Hell's Kitchen reference).  I'm not scoring too low for the slow service -- I was alone at the restaurant and it just might have been my perception.  Had I had someone to talk to, it probably would have seemed better."}
{"text":"I give it a 3.5 the place wasn't as hyped up to be. I was really excited to try it despite the prices and the line. I'm a big Gordan Ramsey fan. The burger didn't have enough flavor for me and the fries can use seasoning. I got the hell's kitchen burger and was expecting a burger with a lot of flavor. It taste like a barbecued burger under seasoned. The wait wasn't that bad but it's hot because there is flames on the sign by the  window where the line starts."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the hype!  We were vastly disappointed.  The service was horrible; we apparently arrived as the shift was changing and our server didn't inform us or the new server that she was leaving, so we constantly had to look for someone to help us.  We had to order food with the bus boy.  The fries were cold and stale, and the burger was the epitome of mediocracy.  The burger lacked any sort of flavor for the 3 cheese burger with added bacon and was small.  Real talk: Go to Fat Burger and have a tasty burger that will satisfy that nasty, gnarly burger flavor your tastebuds lust.  I think what sells the burgers is Gordon Ramsay's face and name all over the joint."}
{"text":"Let's start off by stating the fact that I hold Gordon Ramsey to a higher standard. As a fan of his shows for many years, one can only imagine the amazing tastes that his chefs would create. With this in mind, I was finally able to eat at one of his restaurants; BurGR at Planet Hollywood.  It started with a line in which 2 people in a party have to wait in line while larger parties of 3 or more can actually put their name down. I suggested my wife and I wait at the bar so we may have some drinks while we waited and they said if I want a table, we would need to stay in the line.  The place looked good, the menu looked good, the chefs were working hard, and the presentation of the food was perfect, yet when I got to take the first bite of the Hell's Kitchen burger that the server had announced as the best burger on the menu, the taste was completely bland. I don't kid you when I tell you I can make a frozen patty at home more tastefull than this burger.  My wife had the fish sandwich and the fries, both also bland. Maybe it's partially my fault for expecting more from Gordon or maybe it's because I set high expectations on a place called BurGR so I thought there would be a chance I was about to have the best burger I ever had, but this was far from the case and if you are going to BurGR in hopes of eating a good burger, save your money and go to In-n-out."}
{"text":"Mr. Ramsey, what happened to the amazing chef I have seen on TV, sending back food for not being good enough. I guess that is only on TV.   We arrived late on a Saturday night so excited to experience for the first time a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. I am a huge fan of his and was excited to experience this place. The wait was not long at all. Our server was nice but seemed very rushed and not attentive at all. I asked what she would recommend and said that people order a lot of the Farm Burger- I think that was a recommendation, not quite sure? I decided to try it any way, since who could go wrong with Duck Bacon (mind blown) we also ordered the truffle fries and sweet potatoes fries. The food came out pretty quickly and the server who delivered the food very quickly went over what is in each burger. The farm burger had duck bacon and a runny egg. The bun was nice a soft and made in house. The burger just did not have any flavor or seasoning. It was very plain. The truffle fries on the other hand were amazing, jammed pack with flavor!    Overall it was nothing to rave about. For the cost, I will not be back to have another burger. For a chef who prides himself on flavor and perfection, this is far from it. I would be a little embarrassed if I were him."}
{"text":"Last night in Vegas so we decided to give Gordon's burgers a go and see if they really are all they are cracked up to be.  Firstly a bit of housekeeping - be prepared to queue to get in here, located in Planet Hollywood, we waited for around 15 minutes - one cool thing about the queue (never thought I'd say that) is that there are interactive menus as you wait so you can scroll through your options making your wait time whizz by.   Once we were seated we had a fair idea about what we wanted but had read online that there's a Gordon Burger that's not on the physical menu. I don't want to spoil the secret by telling you what's in it but it was seriously good!  The portion sizes are big - we ordered one cone of sweet potato fries and didn't even come close to finishing them. They also made a mix up with our order and gave us 2 cones by accident and obviously there wasn't a chance of getting through them all.  The burgers were excellent - really gourmet and not actually that expensive. My Uber Cheese Burger was $15 which is suppose is reasonable.  Service was good once we were seated, staff were really attentive (there's al lot of them) but then again what would you expect from a Gordon Ramasy restaurant - he couldn't have awful staff and then go on national TV telling other people to hire better staff!"}
{"text":"Meh! Overall Meh. I would not return at all. The wait wasn't bad, but the $14 burger was. I asked the waiter (who was wearing a uniform WAY too tight for him, and frankly all the server's uniforms were way too tight for any of them, even the skinny and buff ones! Eww!) between the blue cheese burger and the 3 cheese burger he recommended the 3 cheese. WRONG! I should have gone with my instinct and gotten the blue cheese burger, because the \"gourmet\" 3 cheese burger was dry and had barley any cheese on it. It looked as though they had tried their hardest to keep all the cheese right in the center of the burger and in doing so they made it poorly. All the other burgers tend to look over flowing with toppings and ingredients then there's mine. I cut the burger in half and we were asked right at that first bite if all was ok, so of course we said yes, but then didn't see our waiter again until we had to flag him down for our check. This was after the people next to us who arrived AFTER us got there food first and when my sister asked if they were going to get their onion rings we got the oops I forgot to put them in excuse of \"oh I thought you wanted them with your meal\"  VERY poor service! The waiter saw that mort than half my burger was still just sitting there and asked if I wanted it to go, I said I should have gotten the blue cheese burger and his solution was to answer \"Oh well not everyone likes it\" REALLY!?!?! OH WELL!  Then I thought oh good I can fill out a survey about the experience, said just what I did here for the most part and have heard NOTHING from them! I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsey, but not his restaurants!  Bad service + Bad food = you will never get another dime of mine!  Gordon Ramsey should take his own advice and stop fucking things up!"}
{"text":"wow, great place to eat with excellent  service. must have the jalapeños popper, the truffles fries, any of there burger ( the best taste turkey burger ), there cocktail drinks and please don't forget to save room for desserts."}
{"text":"It is very rare that I give out the perfect 5 stars on a review but in all honesty, Gordon Ramsay should be proud of this location, it's staff and the awesome food!  5 stars is definitely deserving!  I was blown away by our server who was one of the best servers I have ever had.  He was in it the while time and a perfect attitude that made me want to come back for more!  Back all that great service up with an unbelievable burger and fixings......and Mr. Ramsay has a winner here!  Big claps, high fives and just an overall wonderful experience!  I couldn't be happier!  I cannot wait to go back and try the chili dog now!  Yum!"}
{"text":"It's the milkshakes that brings all the boys to the yard. No, seriously. It's a 3 star joint, but an extra star because the milkshake was THAT good.  Place doesn't live up to it's counterpart, the GR over at Paris. Lines are always long, expect 30 minutes minimum on any particular time of day. It took us 40 minutes to get a table on a Monday.  We had the farm burger and hell's kitchen burger. Not bad. But not surprisingly good either. Were the ingredients particularly fresh? No really. Was the patty juicy? Not particularly. The truffle fries were good as they should be, you can't screw up fries.  But the main star attraction here is the milkshakes. If it's anything you need to make room for, it's the milkshakes! Not too thick, not too thin, just delicious.  We also saw the next table order the fish burger and it was huge, our neighbour devoured it. Maybe that's better than the average burgers. Bring your rewards card for a whole dollar off - whoopie. Until next time, Gordon!"}
{"text":"Loved this place so much we went twice!! Dont let the long line discourage you, the wait isnt very long and its well worth it.  The hells kitchen burger has everything you would ever want and more! We also ordered jalapeno poppers which were a little large for just two people but so good, truffle fries were fantastic. If you like beer this place is also for you so many options on tap!! I just wish they had one of these in Seattle!"}
{"text":"Exceptional burger place, for a reasonable price, considering you're at a celebrity restaurant on the strip. The wait is long, but worth it. The burger combinations are delicious, my favorite is the one with the fig spread. They are usually perfectly cooked. The thing that sets this place apart is the truffle fries and the desserts. The truffle fries are a concoction of beautifully presented fries with a generous sprinkling of light Parmesan fluffs (for lack of a better word) mixed with freshly chopped herbs, and truffle, of course! Love it! I could probably have an order to myself although it's big enough (and expensive enough) to share. The dessert combinations are also stellar, with delicious milkshakes topped with a wonderful pudding. It sounds weird, but imagine a milkshake topped with a somewhat chocolate mousse-flavored topping. Awesome!! The only flaw we've ever found is once the dip for the fries had a skin on it from being prepared ahead of time. The dishes are starting to looking a bit beaten-up, but considering the high volume of people, understandable. They should swap it out, though, and the placemats are looking a bit raggedy for the image. Not as much kid-friendly as Holstein's, no kids menu. I think Holsteins' burgers on a good day can beat BurGR when they aren't on top of their game. They can't touch BurGR's truffle fries or milkshakes, though!"}
{"text":"Very juicy and tasty burgers. Beer was delicious. Loved their fries and onion rings. Customer service is perfect."}
{"text":"Got the American burger. Hubs got über cheese burger. We thought meat was superior to burger we had a couple of nights before at B&B in Venice. Meat was tender and juicy but did not drip. Fries are hand cut. I rather prefer the shoe string fries but at least with hand cut you know they are fresh and they tasted fresh with nice toppings.  We were too full to get an appetizer or milkshake but they looked wonderful. We would go back."}
{"text":"Good but too salty. Sad to say but I rather have an In and Out or Tommy's burger.  It is a must try though.  The onion rings were very good."}
{"text":"Allora: hamburger divino, patate fritte (quelle grosse) normali, niente di eccezionale, servizio freddino ma cortese e sorridente, manca solo il bacon negli hamburger. Refill come al solito, la cosa che più amo dei locali americani. Gordon, promosso!"}
{"text":"The good:  food was really, really good. The bad: their short chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable, and it took almost an hour from the time we ordered to get our food."}
{"text":"Well, if you want a sub-par, mostly tasteless burger served to you by snotty \"I should be a model instead of a server at this tourist trap dump\", who will snarl at you through their fake eyelashes and caked on foundation, then this is the spot for you. Oh, you think it's gonna be a well crafted take on simple American fare? Well, my \"Hell's Kitchen Burger\" that I ordered medium showed up after roughly an hour. My first bite sprayed not juice, but undercooked, straight red blood all over my hands and plate. If your going to charge me $70 all in for two burgers, onion rings, and fries, then make me suffer through an hour of laughably narcissistic \"service\", at least have the decency and respect for your \"craft\" to rest your meat. You already made me wait an hour, at that point an extra 7 minutes to not twist the knife into the corpse of the fallacy that you called a meal would be a bare minimum. Congrats, you made a mockery of that too. Shame on you Gordon Ramsey."}
{"text":"That was the best restaurant experience I've had in a long time. I mean from the beginning, everything was top notch. Excellent food + great service = how every restaurant should be   1. La fin du monde-you are my new favorite beer 2. Shake #1 (chocolate shake)-where have you been all my life? 3. Truffle Parmesan fries- can I say bomb? The sauce just made it a lot more enticing. 4. Farm burger-how every burger should be made. Or what burgers in burger heaven taste like. 5. Char siu burger- gf says it was really good, but I can't comment because I didn't try it myself.  We'll be back next Sunday! I'm already drooling for more chocolate shake.."}
{"text":"Bomb dot freaking com. Came here during the last day of our labor day weekend trip and so glad that we did. The burger was so damn hood. I had the farm burger with duck breast bacon. So tasty. I don't eat pork so I can't comment on it's authenticity.   My boy ordered the hells kitchen burger and his exact words were \"I've never tasted a burger like this\". In other words the food is awesome.   Our waitress on the other hand was okay.  Took too long for waters.  The hostess were great though. We had to wait an hour for our table but that's expected at such a popular place."}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen burger, truffle fries, and jalapeño poppers is all I gotta say!! Absolutely fantastic. This is our go to spot every time my husband and are in Vegas! Customer service from the hostess's to the servers, to the bussers are always fantastic."}
{"text":"Most AMAZING Burger EVER!!!!  I have been looking forward to going to BurGR for a long time and it was definitely worth the wait.  To start with it is located in Planet Hollywood and there is always a line.  I was by myself so they sat me at the bar facing the prep/cook area and I loved it.  I got to see how they prepped orders and managed the kitchen.  There wasn't any yelling, but it was still fun to watch.  I started with the Jalapeño poppers which each came in an individual dip.  WARNING if you eat them right away you will burn your tongue!!! I tried eating them by just biting in, but you quickly realize that the whole Jalapeño will slide out.  TIP - take it out of the dipping sauce and cut it in half.  That allows it to cool down and you can dip both halves into the sauce.  They were amazing.  There was one spicy one, but nothing that will kill you.  I also ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger.....Soooooooo damn good.  The bun is so soft with seeds that add just the right amount of flavor.  The burger was perfectly cooked to medium and the combination of the flavors was exceptional.  The creaminess of the avocado, the slight crisp of the toasted cheese....by far the best burger I have ever had!!  In addition to the excellent food, the service was superb.  I had a waiter who made some suggestions and everything was spot on.  He was attentive despite being busy and made my experience here one I will never forget."}
{"text":"For something different sit at the counter. Not the bar, the COUNTER. IT'S A WELL OILED MACHINE!.  Here on a busy Saturday afternoon it was fun to see how professional and fast the staff was. Zigging and zagging... as if Gordon himself trained them,.. and yes, the Burgers are great!"}
{"text":"There was a long line next to the fire wall to get in, if you gonna go, make sure to bring someone that has a Diamond total Rewards card :). (probably cut the wait time in 1/2 maybe more) Burgers were pretty good. I had the Britannia burger. Definitely suggest the  Parmesan fries. For desert someone suggested the Sticky Toffee Pudding, which was pretty good as well, I had some of my son's Oreo shake and that was very good. I've tried steak at Gordon Ramsey Steak at Paris so next one is Pub & Grill."}
{"text":"To much hype on this spot...Food was Ok and reasonably priced but thats it..Chairs to close to floor also..annoying"}
{"text":"I had the burger with the truffle oil and it was extraordinarily flavorful. I did ask for medium rare but I received a decidedly medium/medium-well burger. Still, I guess the quality of the meat was high enough that it still wasn't tough. I'd totally go back.  Also my friend got the milk shake and it looked unreal. I'm pretty lactose intolerant though so I didn't dare try it. It's huge though, so if you get it you can definitely split it."}
{"text":"I work with people who love food. People who are so food-centric they can tell you an awesome place to eat in every city across the world. And these people love burgers.   We've visited a number of burger joints in Vegas; Holsteins, Burger Bar, Le Burger Brasserie Sports Grille and now, Gordon Ramsay's BurGR, which was top notch.  We ordered GR's take on jalapeno poppers (they come standing up in a shot glass of dip), pork belly buns and chicken wings. I don't eat pork or beef (which the poppers have), so I saddled up with the wings, which were phenomenal. One had a cilantro-styled sauce and the other was a buffalo wing version. Both stood out with flavors that popped.  Since I don't eat beef or pork, though, my burger options were severely limited. This is why BurGR gets only 4/5 stars from me - a veggie burger that's an actual veggie burger (not a portabello cap) would have been much-welcomed. I don't like giant mushrooms. They freak me out. I was instead inclined to order a salad, which was a noodle salad - and quite tasty. Soba noodles, asian-styled dressing, siracha-laced chicken. Yum. My colleague and I also split a chicken slider. Others who had the burgers raved. \"How is something that is so simple so delicious?\" The fries - we tried three varieties (truffle, regular and sweet potato) all hit the spot, too.  Decent beer selection for Vegas (they even had cider, which was a good surprise because one of our friends prefers that to beer) and the server was friendly and semi-prompt (some lags in drinks but eh, whatevr. - See what I did there.)"}
{"text":"I got the Oreo milkshake which was absolutely delicious. My friends ordered burgers and were very happy with it."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends well in town and hands down spur of  the moment dining I was amazed you cannot believe the level of service you receive from a Gordon Ramsey joint it's a step above all There is no one close to second place when it comes to this place"}
{"text":"Our dining experience here was definitely top notch. Waited in line for like 10 mins and got in. Service was definitely 5 stars due to the fact that the manager (Benji) sat us down and as soon as We asked him what was good there he took the time to ask how hungry I was and gave us a great pairing of of an app, entree, dessert, and drinks. The price was well worth it for high quality of food.   We had the stuffed jalepeno poppers with an awesome sauce for our app. It was paired wit a spicy margarita and a blue moon pumpkin spiced beer that was greatly recommended by Benji the manager. When my lady got get drink b4 the app came out he expedited it so she didn't have to wait to drink wit it the app. We had the farm burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger! All I have to say is taste it and don't just read about it! I'm a food lover and it was the best burger I've ate so far till something else de-throwns it lol. I also like how every time a dish came out it was kindly explained by the friendly staff. Then for desert we had push pop ice cream cakes that topped of our great meals! If ur reading this stop and just got eat there! That's all I have to say! Ask for Benji and tell em Dean sent u! Deuces!"}
{"text":"Excellent Service, Excellent Food. This is the second time I have eaten here and everything just got better. I had the Blue Cheese Burger with Onion Rings and the Jalapeno poppers. They were both great! The atmosphere is like an upscale bar which is relaxing. With the Good food and service you can't go wrong here. I will be returning to try other dishes this place serves up."}
{"text":"I was really really excited to try this restaurant. Not only because of Gordon Ramsey and his standards, but because the food looked amazing.  Got there and the line was quite long, which is fine. Went to the Asian hostess and ask for a table for 2 and she old me the wait would be 20/30 minutes. Sure, no problem. While waiting I got a call from a friend saying that he wanted to join us but wasn't sure yet. Asian Hostess comes to check again \"so table for 2 right? I'm just making sure\". I said, YES but a 3rd person might join us for drinks. She said \"oh no. That changes everything. Your wait now is going to be 1 hr. And I said ok, I will make sure he's coming and I will let you know ASAP. She looked at me and said \"AND DONT EVEN TRY TO SNEAK A 3rd PERSON TO A TABLE FOR 2, OR ELSE YOU'RE GETTING KICKED OUT!\" I was like \"excuse me? Get kicked out of a restaurant? Are you serious?\" She said \"that's how my manager is\". That KILLED my experience. I was really really upset. After that, I dont even remember how my burger tasted like. The straw is shorter than the cup... You have to fish it with your fingers to drink out of it. Definitely NOT the attitude I expected from a GORDON RAMSEY restaurant and his standards."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  The service was excellent. 100 % will be back. The hells kitchen burger was  amazing juciy and spicy."}
{"text":"I really didn't find the burgers here interesting or exciting. I ordered the farm burger, medium-rare, and it came out medium-well and a little dry. I think there are much better burgers around the area (Holsteins and Bachi Burger come to mind). I did really, really like the truffle aioli that came with the truffle parmesan fries though. That was spectacular. But overall, considering the burger itself and the service (terrible, we were waiting around forever for our check), I would only come back if there was no wait."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better burgers I've had in my life. This place is rather popular, so expect a bit of a wait (which you can skip if you have one of the top tier TR memberships), but it's worth it.   We got two burgers and shared fries, which came out to about $50 total before tip with two iced teas. So it's definitely pricey. I wouldn't say I would go back since the price is definitely up there - it's right on the fringe of not being worth the asking price - but I can totally understand the price considering that it's a famous chef's restaurant and the food is very good.   The service was good, but also prepare for a bit of waiting there since they seem just a smidge understaffed with one server working a rather large section. Also, all food is made to order, so there is a bit of an acceptable wait for fresh food."}
{"text":"BEST BURGR I've ever had. Normally not a burger person but a friend said it was a must  so my husband and I went. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burgr. I can't even begin to tell you how good it was. Perfectly cooked and all the flavors went together amazingly. Had the truffle fries to go with it. The catsup was out of this world good. Also had the wings, can't remember the name of them but we called them Chicken lollipops. Not like any other wing I've ever had. There is a secret Burgr not on the menu. I think it is called the Gordon Ramsey. Going back before we leave to try it."}
{"text":"We ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger, Chicken Burger, Parmesan Fries & Blueberry Mojito (Virgin)  The Blueberry Mojito (Virgin) was simply outstanding   The 2 burgers were good but not outstanding   The fries were above average & no great shakes  Place deserves 3 stars overall BUT the Mojito pushed it up 1."}
{"text":"I love the shake more than the burger.  To me, it was more of the hype than anything else.  But it's always good to try new burger joints. It's a bit pricey, but the atmosphere and the staff was great!"}
{"text":"5 stars for food and service 3 stars for the wait But i wont give them a lower rating on something they have no control of lol  One of the best burgers I have ever had, I always get the Farm Burgr with the side of fries Yea I hate when restaurants don't give you fries with your burger but what can i do? lol Fries are good size though so one order is good for 2 people  Burger is juicy and delicious, never disappoints when in vegas.   Gordon Ramsay makes a really good burger!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan. I watch Kitchen Nightmares, Hell's Kitchen, and MasterChef. That being said, I wasn't really expecting BurGR to be that amazing. It's a casual restaurant in an incredibly touristy location (the Strip), and it's not like Gordon Ramsay is there personally cooking the burgers. I was especially skeptical after walking into the restaurant and seeing all of the waitstaff dressed like the Mondo Burger employees from the movie Good Burger. Seriously, the servers wear ridiculously flashy and tight-fitting outfits that look like how people in the 1980's would imagine people in 2013 would dress.  Anyway, in spite of the unusual garb of the servers, the service was excellent. Even though the place was very busy, we were still seated quickly and received our food in a reasonable amount of time. The servers were knowledgeable about the menu too. We also had a view of the open kitchen and had our appetites whetted by all of the amazing food being prepared in the kitchen.   Simply put, our food was outstanding! I was worried that my parents wouldn't enjoy their food because they don't eat beef or pork. However, they really enjoyed their dishes. My mom had Damnation Chicken Burger. Although it wasn't \"fiery hot\", it was very flavorful. It was also interesting that instead of using a chicken breast, they made a patty out of ground chicken. It was a good way to keep in the spirit of creating a burger out of chicken. My dad had the fish and crisp sandwich, and he thought it was quite good. My parents both absolutely loved the fries. The fries were absolutely perfect in terms of shape, size, crunch, and saltiness. They also came with a curry ketchup that somehow made them taste even better. If there's one idea I'd like to try at home, it's to make curry ketchup like I had at BurGR.  My burger was incredible too. I had the Euro Burger cooked to medium rare. Everything about the burger was executed perfectly. The meat was juicy and flavorful, the goat cheese was rich and creamy, the arugula and roasted tomato were spot on. The truffle aioli is what really made this one of the best burgers I've ever had though. Normally when places have a truffle sauce, the taste of the truffles just overpowers the rest of the dish. However, in this aioli the truffle taste was more subtle.   For dessert, we tried the sticky toffee pudding push pops. I felt like they were a bit gimmicky though. The ice cream and the sticky toffee pudding were separated into layers, so I couldn't really mix them together. I would have preferred to just have them together in a bowl.   Overall, this place was definitely up to the high standards that Gordon Ramsay preaches about in all of his shows. If you want to try the best burgers in Vegas, you've gotta go to BurGR."}
{"text":"Lets get this out of the way first: whoever is in charge of hiring is doing an EXCELLENT JOB. It's probably just me, but wow, I've never seen so many attractive, friendly, comely ladies all working in one place, or maybe I just don't get out much. Regardless, it was decently eye-pleasing. Oh, the food was pretty good too. :)  Our server, I believe her name was Sabrina, who best fit the description above, was very professional, friendly, and communicated effectively in a place where it is very noisy due to the large crowd. She first gave us the drinks menu on a mini computer tablet, which I found to be a bit bothersome scrolling down the page to look at everything and reading all the descriptions as fast as possible because there was only one tablet and my friends all wanted to take a look at it too. She gave us a few recommendations, and highly suggested the Innis and Gunn draft beer, which I ordered. Sorry, I'm a gullible fool when it comes to beautiful ladies, but I love trying new beers, and this one did not disappoint. It was smooth, flavorful, aromatic, and balanced. It had a nice mix of bitter and sweet, crispy and bright, and malty and light. Excellent recommendation!  On to the food, we first ordered the Fried Jalapeño Poppers, and Sabrina told us that one of them has the seeds left in it, so someone will get a rude awakening. We all ate at least one, and I had two, but it didn't seem like anyone got it. Though, I admit that my first popper was hotter than the second one because the second didn't have any heat at all. If I did get the one with the seeds, I prefer all of them to have the seeds! Other than that, the poppers were very, very good. Loved the crispiness and lightness of the batter, the creamy cheddar fillings, and the tasty cheddar ranch sauce on the bottom. I liked how it was presented: shot glasses were used as the serving vessel for the poppers with the ranch sauce in the bottom served on a glass plate. A well-prepared and constructed dish.  The second appetizer we ordered was the Fury Chicken Wings. The wings were all frenched into lollipops, fried, and coated in a sweet and tangy sauce with crumbles of blue cheese and slivers of carrot. As simple as this dish was, I really enjoyed this dish. The sauce on the wings was incredibly tasty, and the creamy blue cheese added a nice savory and bitter element to the sweetness of the sauce with the carrots cutting into the richness and added crunchy element. This was a perfect bite of food.  For my burger, I went with the Chanterelle Burger, medium rare, with arugula with a fig-onion jam. First bite, WOW. The burger was a perfect medium rare that was well-seasoned, flavorful, and juicy, and the juices wasn't running out and going all over place! Finally, a restaurant that actually rests their burgers at the optimal time! Obviously not a fast food place. The arugula added the freshness and bitterness that almost balanced out the sweetness of the fig-onion jam. For me, there was a bit too much jam in the burger as it slightly overpowered the mushrooms and parts of the burger. The best part of the burger was the buns! The inner part of the buns were tasty and crispy while the outer part was firm and toasty with the inside still soft. This was probably the best or one of the best burger I've ever had.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here. The service was excellent. Sabrina was very attentive and friendly (and pretty). The food came out at the right amount time. Lastly, the burgers are great! With the Gordon Ramsay running it, it has to be.  I am definitely coming here the next time I am in Vegas!  On a final note, our lovely server, Sabrina, actually remembered us as we ran into her many, many hours later in the Planet Hollywood casino and she greeted us. What other server would even care to say \"hello\" to customers, or even remember any customers at all, especially going through so many during one shift? I suppose we were that memorable. :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch at the Las Vegas Gordon Ramsay BurGR reataurant, with my wife and another couple.  Our wait time wasn't too bad; perhaps only 20 minutes or  so.  Thought it would be more judging from the line! Very trendy place; very much in keeping with most places in Las Vegas at this level.  Service was okay, and I liked the tables, menus and even the fact that the server immediately brought another dish as my wife and I said we'd share an entree.  We had the Britannia burger, and it was very tasty, although on the smaller side.  The four of us shared a tower of onion rings; not usually my first choice, but this time I'm glad we had them.  Recommend it!"}
{"text":"I really shouldn't have gone here.  I watch Hell's Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares.  After eating here, I lost all faith in Gordon Ramsay.    Shakes are really delicious.  Got the parmesean truffle fries.  They are ok, but they needed more truffle oil.  Now for the burgers.  Granted they were nice and moist, they lack flavor.  Not worth the money you spend for them.  Google top burgers in vegas, yelp them even, and you won't see this restaurant on the list for good reason.    Kitchen Nightmares will never be the same again.  I should have never went here :("}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I wasn't sure if this was just hype or if the food was good. I can tell you my burger was exceptional!! It was cooked and seasoned to perfection, it didn't need any condiments to add taste or flavor to the burger. It was so good I craved eating it again the next day."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries.  VERY pricey, but this is Vegas!!!!  The seating staff were jerks and we had a party of seven and two ere on the way over and would not seat us until everyone was there.  NOT busy at all and our table sat empty as we were forced to wait for twenty minutes as we could have had drinks and apps.  Would I go back when if Vegas....maybe at best"}
{"text":"Came here on Sunday for lunch and waited about 15 minutes. Extremely reasonably priced for a Gordon Ramsey restaurant located in Vegas where most food is a tad more pricey. Portions are huge! Ended up taking half of our food to go   Burgers will range from $12-15. Patty is huge and juicy.   Gooey fries - fries top with cheese, bacon bits, and egg. Good but gets overwhelming quickly. Share it with 3+ people  Farm burger - comes with duck breast bacon and egg. Duck breast bacon was interesting. Good but more chewy and thick than regular bacon  Truffle burger $21 - the most expensive burger. Very good if you like truffle."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  The group shared the gooey fries which were outstanding.  I had the farm burger which was excellent.  In addition the service, decor, and price were all great."}
{"text":"For tonight's dinner: Hell'sKitchen burger with fries for the man & The Damnation Chicken burger with Maui Onion rings for myself. The coffee shake had Hazelnut pudding top, a perfect sweet treat. Nice touch with the Boba Tea straw for the shake! We'll definitely be back for more. It's worth the wait! (The line just continued to be as long from the time we sat down.  TIP: Try to get a seat at the bar, shorter wait.)"}
{"text":"My mom and I went visited this place again and our experience wasn't as pleasant as the first.   MENU: Burgers. Fries. Shakes. Appetizers. Typical burger joint offerings.   QUALITY: We ordered the Euro Burgr which includes a patty, goat cheese, arugula, and tomatoes. The burger patty tasted a bit gamey. The cheese was not overwhelming at all. We also ordered the Gooey Fries which includes cheese, salami, and a fried eggs. The toppings were great but the fries tasted old right off the back. This definitely needs to eaten right away or else the cheese gets cold and hard. We also ordered the Pork Belly Hot Pockets. The filling inside was tasty but I felt like the pastry could have been crispier.   PRICES: Typical gourmet prices. Burgers don't come with fries on the side so be prepared to pay about $20-25 for both. The hot pockets were not worth the $14 when we only received two.   CUSTOMER SERVICE: There's always a long line which means long waits, and we felt as if we were being rushed during our meal. My mom and I would break from eating and just talk, and we were asked several times if we were finished eating. Like, no bye. Then our waiter was passing by our table and accidentally hit one of our plates with his hip, which hit the glass of water and made a huge clank noise, but the waiter wasn't phased by this at all - just kept walking pass.  Overall, I'm disappointed in our experience. I was excited to eat here again because my first experience was so great. However, I'm hesitant in ever returning again."}
{"text":"This was one of the best flavored burgers ever! And the sweet potato fries were fabulous! No one liked the regular fries though, so we docked a star for that."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch on a Monday. The place was packed, the service was fantastic. All of the employees we could see looked happy and glad to be there. Our server was a nice looking gal with a lot of tattoos. She was very attentive and always had a smile. Best burger and fries EVER. ( A little pricey though)."}
{"text":"After a horrible service at the Sugar Factory, we moved to BurGR and loved it.  It was definitely expensive, however the whole experience was top notch.    From the start we were very impressed with their wait system to be seated. They take your cell phone and will txt you when your table is ready.  We had very little of a wait, but it was a nice touch that we could go stand out and enjoy the fresh air on the strip while we waited.  We had high expectations and although I'm not sure how, they surpassed them.  We eat out a lot and like simple food, so you could say my family are experts at burgers and fries.  We loved the food.  I heard several times from my wife and kids that the burgers were the best they've ever had.  My wife loved the Garlic Parmesan with truffle  sauce.    I had read about the sticky toffee pudding desert at another Ramsay restaurant so I ordered those for all of us and everyone loved them.  Their staff was a treat to be with also as they were friendly and top of things, including bringing refills before they were needed.  BurGR is a top notch place, great service, nice friendly staff and excellent tasting food.  It's no wonder why Gordon Ramsay is so successful as he makes his places the best hands down."}
{"text":"March 3017 - Had to come back a year later and it was still amazing. My husband described his burger to our son as \"outta sight\" and it was. We had the Euro burger again.   This was our first meal in Vegas after driving all day from Houston. We sat down and talked after ordering but the second the plates are down, there is more taking. Only yummy food eating noises. This place will never get old for me."}
{"text":"I wish we had this place in California, but I guess the drive isn't that bad from Los Angeles. I loved the burger here. To get seated, was at least an hour wait, there was a line around 9pm on a Saturday, but that wasn't going to stop me and my boyfriend from trying Gordon's burgers. By the time we got our food, from the time we stood in line, two hours had passed, so expect this. Good things come to those to wait. I ordered the truffle burger, and shared fries and onion rings with my boyfriend. I really loved the weird curry ketchup that came with the fries! I've never had anything like that with french fries before and I wish I could have it all of the time now. It reminded me of eating potato samosas and the sauce you get with it. The onion rings were ok. I don't know if they were suppose to be a little battery, but alone, they didn't have much flavor; I wouldn't order them again. The burger was packed with flavor. The meat  was delicious and I think the truffle and other dressings really complimented each other. This is my favorite burger in Vegas."}
{"text":"The first time I walked past the restaurant earlier during the day, I remember thinking to myself, what a tourist trap! I vowed never to support such an establishment that taught kids that burger was spelled b-u-r-g-r without the E. No wonder kids have poor spelling these days.   But after we ran the Las Vegas Half Marathon, my friends and I decided to pop into Gordon Ramsay's BurGR restaurant to stuff ourselves full of the fatty greasy foods that we deserved.   This restaurant had some oh-so-fancay technology. The hostesses checked us in with their ipads and then sent us a text when the table was ready.  This was great because it allowed us to go back to the room, freshen up after the marathon, and then come back down when our table was ready to avoid waiting in the horrendous line.  Of course the hostess seemed to have a bit of attitude when she checked us in and looked us up in down in our running gear and dirty tennis shoes. We were GOING to change! Sheesh.  Now, let's talk food.  The BurGR's were... very interesting. Not bad but also not melt in your mouth delicious.  Had the famous hog burger. The flavors were interesting and unique, but a bit too sweet for my liking. The Farm Burger was pretty delicious but again, not fantastic. Truffle fries were a win and definitely recommend but it is def a kickin dish that will keep you burping up truffle oil and garlic for the rest of the night.   I prefer the type of burger that has a flavorful patty filled with flavors that naturally mesh together into one delicious burger. BurGR was chic and pristine in presentation, but lacked in flavor and oompth.   It's Gordon Ramsay. Of course I will have high expectations.  Did the food meet expectations? Errr maybe but if it did, just barely.    Side note: If a restaurant is going to flaunt use of technology like ipads and iphones, I expect it to be working properly. Our bill had an iphone embedded in it! I kept pressing the button only to be informed by our server that the phone was out of battery since it's been busy all day, and also the phone simply displayed ads and had no actual function to serve toward making paying the bill easier. Lame."}
{"text":"I instantly fell in love with BURGR.  When we got there it seemed like the line would be long but we got through it fairly quickly, about 15 minutes. When we sat down, the waiter was quick. He knew his stuff. When I asked for recommendations, he was very knowledgeable about how to make my burger taste even better.   Now for the burger: I ordered the Euro burger ($16) which has goat cheese (which I tend to not like but went along with what the waiter recommended) and arugula, oven roasted tomato and truffle aioli. HOLY COW it was good. When it first comes to you, it doesn't look like a huge burger, but trust me, it is filling and just very satisfying. It was perfectly cooked to medium and the taste worked very well together.  My boyfriend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger ($14) and he couldn't get enough. He;s so picky too but really like how the flavors were on point.   We shared an order of just fries ($8) and they were kind of like steak fries and one order was plenty for the two of us. Te flavored ketchup (chipotle ketchup and curried ketchup) were good too. I'm not much or a ketchup person, but I was enjoying it.  Yes, the price for this plus a beer for my boyfriend was about $ 45 before tip, but it was completely worth it. We left full and happy with our meals.  We plan on going back before we leave town because it was THAT good."}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had. Ruined it for all other burgers in America. How can you enjoy a gourmet burger from anywhere else once you've eaten the absolute perfect burger. If you haven't been here before it a must next time you're in Vegas. Located in Planet Hollywood Casino. Top notch service and over the top experience to say the least. Thanks Chef Ramsey for making it impossible to enjoy a burger anywhere else. Either open one in Orange County California or help me figure out air fare to travel back to your place once a month. Don't think I can go any longer without withdrawals"}
{"text":"i was there for the experience for my sons 16th birthday but it was disappointing. the food we ate was o.k. then we told the waitress the hotdog was to salty then she said that she will just credit us the amount. then by the time we paid our bill the the credited amount was still there. then they maid the neccessary changes. After 3 days i check my account i was charge almost $300 dollars which my bill was supposed to be only $139.i was charge twice  then i called them to dispute this issue i asked for the manager  the holst told me what was the issue then i told her to just direct me to the manager i had the chance to say my name ask his name and i was cut off then keep on calling then never answer back. then i left my cell # still waiting for respond. what an experience ha? and I'm still waiting for there call to credit the amount they took."}
{"text":"We love watching Gordon Ramsay on TV so we have just had to stop at a couple of his restaurants while in Las Vegas.  We found this one just as it was opening.  It was a little early for lunch so we decided to just split the American BurGr with onion rings.  The meat was quite a bit overcooked.  We ordered it medium and there was no pink in it at all.  Seasoning was still good.  Onion rings were delicious.  Our server was friendly but we did have quite a wait for our bill. We asked for our check and she took off to take other orders.   Other than the server wait and overcooked burger, we would have rated it a 5."}
{"text":"I had the Gordon Ramsay Special Burger that was not on the menu and the Truffle Fries. It was good and service was excellent. The fries was big enough to share between 3 of us and there was still left overs. the burger was HUGE and I can barely finish...  I totally recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Worth any wait in line.  The farm burger with duck breast bacon and fried egg is amazing.  Also try the truffle fries."}
{"text":"O.M.G. five stars for the milk shake!!!!!!! get them!!!  three stars for everything else. the farm burger i got was very salty that i couldn't finish, fries were burnt... good thing i am a fan otherwise i might get tired of seeing his face everywhere in the restaurant? lol  i doubt i'll go back again though... but overall an OK experience!"}
{"text":"I decided to break my pescatarian streak for an \"American Burger\"and \"just fries\" because Gordon Ramsay is a bad ass,.. and because I'm in Vegas. After a long pool day yesterday I wanted a quick bite, so I was able to cut the long line at Burger and sit at the bar since i was solo. My girlfriend was napping.  I sat at the bar for about 10 minutes and neither bartender acknowledged me with eye contact,  \"I'll be right with you\" or  a \" can I grab you a beer? \". Instead of speaking up with an \"uuhum\" I just walked out since I was already too irritated. Probably not the best way to handle it but I was in no mood to complain.   Today I went back with a new attitude and again sat at the bar. Totally different experience with the same bartender. Food was perfect! I even got one to go..   The only downside is that they wouldn't whip up some thousand island dressing but they do have really good chipotle and curry ketchups."}
{"text":"Seriously wow. Was their 2 days ago and wow. Went in about 1230 pm and there was a wait. The lady whipped out her ipad and took our cell number and said wed receive a text when our table was ready.  Maybe just me being a goof but I thought it was super cool! Took about 25 minutes but was expected with the crowd so wandered the casino floor. When we were seated my mouth was watering looking at everyone's food. We sat down and the staff was super friendly. We ordered the onion rings to start and holy heck these were the BEST I've ever had. The crisp on the outside crumbled in my mouth as the onion only gave the slightest of resistance as i bit through it. Soooo good! The house ranch that came with was outstanding as well.  The burger, which was the farmhouse, was simply epic. Let me say this, cheeseburgers are my bliss. Every city I go to I look for an awesome burger place and have had more burgers then probably any other food and this was flat out the best. The meat was cooked to a perfect medium and the egg was fried perfectly! The duck belly bacon was awesome. The fries were good. Not mind blowing but when you have that burger it simply compliments it. Every time I hit vegas I will have to return here. Even my fiance' who is not a hardcore burger person absolutely loved and devoured her classic american hamburger. The place has a good modern hip feel to it. Highly recommend to ANYONE they have a pretty wide array of burger options nothing to crazy just good old burgers and add on's. Do yourself a favor and grab a burger.  The only draw back was due to the wait but was understandable with the crowd. So good!"}
{"text":"We'd actually dined here the last time we were in LV, in April 2014. Good then, and same now.  I thought that after some four years in business, the long lines would've diminished somewhat, but you can still count on waiting at least for a little while (I guess that's good for Gordon!). The interactive menu and serpentine-esque flame wall is a nice distraction in the interim. As it was, it was only around a 10-minute wait, if that. From hostess to servers, it's a friendly staff.  The interior is lots of orange, appropriately enough given the strong \"flame\" motif. The restaurant itself is on the smallish side, so I can see how it would fill up pretty quickly, resulting in those waits.  Word(s) of caution about the tables: they're on the small side and can shrink before you know it, depending on what you and your dining mate have. Once all our fare arrived I found myself constantly adjusting my beverages' positions (I always order lemonade and a glass of water), worrying one or both of them would tumble off. Definitely tables for two, barely. The many TVs were all placed within excellent sight lines.   I tried the Uber Cheese Burger last time, complete with four different cheeses (white cheddar, fontina, asadero, and boursin), and I admit, it was pretty darned good. Since then, I've been trying to embrace vegetarianism, or at least pescetarianism, so beef was out this time around. I'd heard a lot about the Fish & Crisp sandwich - they put kind of a different spin on it, both in taste and appearance - so I opted for that. The Ms., same as last time, went with the Southern Yardbird Burger, basically their take on a chicken sandwich. (I know - go to a gourmet burger restaurant and order anything *but* an actual burger!) We also got a basket of regular fries to split; I've heard the truffle fries are great, but we just wanted to go basic this time. Note that sides aren't part of the burger/sandwich entrée; they need to be ordered separately.  The Fish & Crisp looked just like I'd seen in pictures - battered cod topped with salt/vinegar straws and tartar sauce, sort of resting atop a hot dog-like bun. I kind of lightly jammed the fish into the bun with my fork to make for a less messy eating experience. It was superb - you could tell everything was fresh, from the bun to the cod to the sauce, all of it. The bun was toasted in a way that really accentuated the sandwich's taste. The salt and vinegar crisps were also very good - I actually wound up scooping some of them off the cod and mixing them with the fries...good stuff. My wife enjoyed the Southern Yardbird again, as well; I had a small piece of it last time and it was really good, especially with the mustard BBQ sauce.   Going back to the fries, which were also fine, try them with the curry/chipotle ketchup! I prefer my fries with minimal, if any, seasoning and no dressing whatsoever, but I made an enthusiastic exception here.   I couldn't finish everything in one sitting - I rarely do - so I took half of the sandwich and about a handful or two of fries back to our timeshare and had it the next morning for brunch, and it was just as good reheated.  The Fish & Crisp was $17, and worth it, IMO - I know seafood's always a tad pricier, and let's face it, you're also paying for the name behind it (and probably the location, too). It's a decent-sized portion, as well.   I'd gladly recommend this place and look forward to returning here next trip to LV."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype! My burger (farm burger) was cooked perfectly and even the egg was cooked to perfection! Thanks chef!!!"}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to Sin city, me and my brother decided we would try out Ramsay's newest venture on the strip. We headed over to Planet Hollywood and got in the \"20 minute wait\" line. I let my brother wait as i hit a few slot machines, 20 minutes later we were seated, good start.  Our waiter came to take our drink order but it was early and we were not in the mood for one of the many beers they have on tap so we just got waters. Our food orders were taken in a timely manner, and then we waited... and waited... and waited some more. In my opinion, a medium rare burger and some fries should not take over 25 minutes to come out, but hey maybe thats what a Ramsay restaurant is all about.  I got the cheese cheese and more cheese burger, it was, to say the least, cheesy. I love cheese, but I was a little cheesed out by the end of it. We ordered the truffle garlic fries and they were very good.   The prices were not ridiculous, i think we spent about $40 total for our two burgers and fries.   I think the long wait left a bad taste in my mouth, so one star off for that. The other because the food just was not five star worthy, but it is a good burger. I'll probably try the Cosmo's burger place next time before i come back here."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've had, or will ever have. I guess it all depends on what your willing to pay for a burger. It was good, the wait staff was accommodating, the atmosphere was cool. The house made ketchups are unique.  I'd suggest to try it, although I probably won't go back again. I just don't love a hamburger enough to pay that much for it, but that's just me."}
{"text":"The wait for this restaurant can be very LONG. Luckily, the wait time is much shorter if you have only 2 people in your party. My friend and I waited about 30 minutes for dinner on a Sunday night.   We got seated in the corner next to the servers computer/water station. It was a very inconvenient seat, because the servers are constantly crowding near you. It felt intrusive almost.   Ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger with the truffle fries. The fries are thick steak fries. I thought the flavors were nice and the side of ketchup was good. The burger was juicy and the burger was overall flavorful and good.   One big complaint was our server- Ginger. She was really kind in the beginning, but after she took our order, she NEVER came back. We had to ask other servers for our requests- water/napkins/etc.."}
{"text":"There can be a 25 minute wait but customer service seems to make it go by quickly. Parking is easy in the mall. The prices aren't terribly outrages $15 for a burger. $10 for onion rings and $11 for truffle fries. Seems like a lot but that's Vegas for you. If you're a fan of Gordan Ramsay I say the place is a must. Tasty burgers and fries. Love the decorations and little thoughts Gordan put into this restaurant"}
{"text":"Yucky yucky yucky!  What the hell fellow yelpers? Anyone who gives this place more than 2 stars has clearly never been to in n out, or even McDonalds for that matter ( yes, I just suggested McDonalds is better than this).    What a freaken waste of 50 dollars! This place is not worth the hype. Food is super greasy,  and the meat isn't even cooked properly, and it is flavorless. I was so disappointed that as I was walking out I was telling people in line that this wasn't worth the hype or a penny of their money. I am confident God is going to reward me for telling people the truth and saving people money.   Gross! Gross! Gross!!!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars. I've been here twice and always thought the burgers were pretty good. A good variety of choices. I recommend the truffle fries, their delicious. Might not have the best burger, but a pretty good one."}
{"text":"Wait time 25 min. I got Mint mojito and it was really good.the jalapeño poppers are amazing must try . Based on the reviews on yelp I ordered the hell kitchen burger not a big deal though. I've had better ."}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be awesome, and while it DID deliver good food, it kind of fell short.  Our table got two Farm Burgers (with duck bacon and an egg), sweet potato fries, and milkshakes.  The burger came on nice soft rolls, the egg was runny and poured out over the burger (which is good). The burgers were good, a tad over done (I don't think there was ANY pink in it..ordered 'a bit over medium, with some pink in it'). It was tasty, but not mind blowing and nothing Id really crave again.  The sweet potato fries came with powdered sugar and a weird jalapeño mayonnaise thing to dip. The sauce looked like lemon glaze or something, but had no flavor. So it just sat there in eaten. The fries were well cooked and tasty. I'd never had powdered sugar on them before, but it was good.   The real standout were the milkshakes. I had the coffee shake with pudding on top and my friend (special) ordered a plain vanilla.  The pudding made the shake heavy (maybe too heavy) but was still delicious. My friend said it was the best vanilla shake he's had. The straws were like 1/2 in wide.  All in all, Id go back for a shake, but nothing else. Seriously, no matter what you decide on, definitely get a milkshake. They're great! Service was awesome too. I can't remember our servers name, but she was a curled peroxide blond, with a small nose ring, and she was fantastic. Very friendly and very helpful. Probably the best service we had during the entire trip."}
{"text":"My expectations were met. I've had a fair share of good burgers in my life but this one has got to top it all. The meat of my burger was extremely juicy and had a unique taste. It was well cooked and had little grease in it. The condiments was what surprised me the most. Every bite I took I was able to identify the different flavors within the burger. For once, the condiments within the burger did not interfere with the taste of the meat. I can pick out the taste of the bun, meat, lettuce, onion and tomatoes with every bite. This is a top quality burger and definitely satisfied my burger cravings.  Their onion rings were a little above average. Very flavorful with a lot of seasoning. The only problem I had was that there was a lot of batter on a small onion ring which made it look like a huge onion ring slice."}
{"text":"Went here with my family to check out what all of the hype is about. FYI--if you are thinking of eating here anywhere close to a normal eating hour, prepare to wait.  After reading many Yelp reviews, I decided to go with the Britannia burger and the truffle fries.  The Britannia burger was decent, though nothing amazing. The meat was seasoned pretty well, but everything else was a bit lackluster. I don't know if it's because I have been in the LA burger scene too long, but I was not impressed.  The truffle fries were even more disappointing, as they failed to even impart any truffle flavor.  Another person from my group said that the sweet potato fries were delicious but I did not have an opportunity to try them.  Overall, this place has average burgers, Vegas prices, and a long wait. Might as well skip it and try something else in my opinion."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't let a server ruin my experience at a restaurant but the service was terrible.  The food was just okay and the shake with pudding was garbage.  There's plenty of other casual restaurants in Vegas to spend your money at."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Every year we come here a few times, and Burgr is always a common stop for us. I wouldn't have this place any different; so good!"}
{"text":"I am a burger FREAK. I could eat them every day and be happy. So when this celebrity chef burger place opened, I was curious but skeptical.   OH dear sweet baby Jesus. These burgers are phenomenal. We've been there twice now and had a great experience both times. Their wings are phenomenal too. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre experience at best. I feel like the burgers at Five Guys have more flavor than this place. I honestly forget what type of burgers my husband I ordered because they were so forgettable.  My husband is a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, so I wanted to treat him to one of his restaurants in Vegas. And since we both love burgers, this place seemed to fit the bill!  We waited a little while in line to get seated, which wasn't too bad, but the place seemed disorderly. Like, everyone was running around trying to get stuff done without actually getting anything done. If that makes sense.  They have lots of TV's available and it was football season when we went, so there was a huge football group in there hanging out and having fun.  Our server was decent, not overly friendly.. It took awhile for them to take our order and bring drinks.  The food was plated nicely, but again, the burgers were forgettable.   We were really excited about dessert, because if you watch Gordon on TV he's always yelling about the STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING! So we were happy to see he had a twist of this dessert on his menu - Sticky Toffee Pudding Pops. Meh. Just ok. Weird consistency and not super awesome. Hard to get the dessert out of the pop!  Was sad to give this place a mediocre review, but it's Vegas and there are a million places vying for your money. Definitely try it if you're a Gordon Ramsay fan, but if you want a good burger, go elsewhere. Like StripBurger at the Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"Don't go if you're vegetarian/vegan. The meatless/portebello burger has good flavor but does not hold together. It's not put together well it greatly takes away from the experience. The fries were cold and hard like they'd been sitting for quite some time. Service was not so good either. No thanks."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Looks really cool, plates, silverware good presentation was all very unique and cool.  The food wasn't huge portion, but the taste is incredible. Fries, dessert and burgers were all so good. When we go back to Vegas, we are coming back!  Decent prices too!!"}
{"text":"It's painful to give BurGR two stars, but based on my experience on 07/08/2013, it was deserved and warranted. Since my first visit on 03/14/2013, I have been RAVING about this place. I even stated that it was my Top 5 favorite burger and fries! It was a big deal. Which is even more of a reason it was so disappointing to receive the horrible quality of food and service the second time.  The hostesses were gracious and the wait time was accurate, very respectable. Our server was very kind, but as the meal went on, it was clear that he didn't care very much. Our water glasses would empty without even a glance from our server or any of the many bussers walking around. It was like being ignored and unfortunately, it wasn't just our table!   I ordered the Farm Burger, medium rare. I'm usually worried about the proper cooking of my steak/burger, but it was perfect during my first visit, so I didn't even think about it. Yeah, I should have worried. It was disappointingly medium and slightly dry. Sad. Everything else was really nice on the burger though! My friend ordered the Euro Burger (which I had last time) and we didn't realize at the time that it didn't come with one of the burger's main components: the oven-roasted tomato (and now that I think about it, the aioli seemed nonexistent as well..)! Why did that happen?! It wasn't until I looked back at photos from my first visit that I realized it was missing! We both ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries because of my recommendation and again, disappointed. I received a batch of dry, overcooked fries. So sad! My friend's fries were really good and the truffle aioli was awesome!  So after the meal, we asked to have our burger and fries boxed, which our server was happy to do. When he came back, I had this weird feeling that I should check the contents (probably because of the \"stellar\" experience preceding this moment) and surprisingly, my burger was missing! Seriously, what is going on??  Finally, when our server brought back our leftovers, he was ready to get our check without even bothering to ask if we wanted dessert. It's really not a deal breaker, however, I know most restaurants want their servers to ask if diners want to consume more food and beverages (he didn't ask if I wanted another cocktail either) or at least suggest dessert.   Not a pleasant experience. The fries are still some of the best fries ever, but it's tough to think about ever going back after everything that happened. Sad to say."}
{"text":"Surprisinig how good a Burger can taste. If you have a Total rewards card you save a couple of bucks (so get one - it is free) - if you have any status with the casino you can skip the (most of the time long) line.The food is really awesome. Love it!"}
{"text":"I was there like, 2 months ago.  This review is a tad late.  Upon reccomendation from my mom and sister, and unsure of what Vegas meal \"adventure\" was next....I went to BurGR.  Gordon Ramsay is their thing.  I'm not a big fan of \"Hells Kitchen\" but I like burgers and new experiences.  Ok. so...I have never seen it...but I didn't trust their judgement.  I should have.  After some awkwardness with some hostesses in tight dresses, I was seated.  Heather took my order.  Total sweetheart!  She deserves 5 stars alone for her attentiveness!!  She reccomended a drink which was fantastic and I ordered the \"Hells Kitchen\" which was delicious and discounted with my Total Rewards card!!!   I love when I pay less for meat for being a degenerate gambler!   I didn't walk out with a picture of Gordon Ramsay or with a million bucks, but still totes one of the best animal carcasses in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a Vegas must go. I absolutely love this place. The wait can be crazy so make sure you check in and continuously go to them to make sure that they remember you. The cost is about $30 per person for burgers and fries. The Burger was amazing so I argue it is worth the cost and wait. The fries are medio-core so I saw splitting it would be good for a few people.Do not order your own fries with the burger unless you can eat A LOT. I did not like the sweet potato fries but then again I hate sweat potatoes so that makes sense. I got the Truffle Parmesan Fries when I was here and the Duck Bacon burger with the fried egg. It was worth it.   I came here for my best friends birthday and they do some little things for birthday like giving out a couple of popsicle bars.   Come here for the burger, forget everything else. Make sure you wait in line before you are hungry or else you will be starving or passed out by the time you get there."}
{"text":"I totally hate to do this but the environment kinda killed it for us. You cannot hear the person sitting right next to you talk. The server just kinda pretended she heard everything we said but I don't think she did. the food itself was great, but hard to enjoy a meal that should be a memorable one when you cant even talk to the person your there with. Definitely make a reservation they say you don't need but its most likely an hour wait if you don't. I expected better service."}
{"text":"OMG. There are no words. Had to hit this place while in town. The wait was not bad for 2 people, and if it was, we would've waited anyway. (And you should too!!) It is less busy upon opening at 11 am, and later at night. Did not try the appetizers because we wanted the shakes. Will try some next time though. We ordered the cookies & creme shake that had creme brûlée pudding in it! To die for! My Hubby (we were honeymooning), had the coffee shake with- wait for it- hazelnut pudding! He also had the Hells kitchen burger. (mine was better). I got a euro burger. It was cooked to perfection and had truffle aioli on it. Unreal. Could be the best burger I have ever had. Ever. The burgers were def big enough- so big we split one on our second trip there. Also had truffle fries which also have the amazing truffle/garlic aioli for dipping. I can't express how delicious the aioli was. I was practically licking the bowl. Could not leave without having the sticky toffee pudding push pops!! Too cute. Very good, but not as good as the original sticky toffee pudding offered at Gordon's gastropub @Caesars. Can't wait to go back! My one gripe- they don't let you call ahead for take out. We wanted to grab more Gordon for the plane ride home."}
{"text":"The burgers are great, but is worth the wait? Depends how much you want to eat at Gordon Ramsay restaurant, because there are plenty of just as good burgers around the strip without a wait.   The chicken wings were honestly the best thing we had with this meal, simply perfect. The burgers were all nice and very tasty, cooked perfectly. The fries were good as well. I also ordered a milk shake, I forget which one, but I think it was something with banana. It was alright, extremely rich and thick, not for the faint of heart.   Good, but pass on it unless you're willing to wait for it."}
{"text":"Great burgers! Excellent service! I was impressed with everything except the seats. They are cracked which is tacky to me. It isnt a cheap burger and fry place so I expect the decor to be nice. Overall it was an enjoyable experience and I will be back. I am bummed that I didn't check it out sooner! I have been passing it for years in PH. I was so sure it would be just another overpriced burger. I was mistaken. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Visited the evening of 5/26 for dinner. Not sure we could have been more disappointed.   Once we were seated out server took his sweet time getting to us. Once he did it seemed like he thought he was doing us favor by waiting on us.  Fries were a 2 of 5. Not cooked enough. Burger was a 4 of 5. Good bun, done just right. Expensive but worth it  Took 40 minutes from when we ordered until we got our burgers and fries. It was not crowded. That and the poor service make me rate this a 2.   I've seen Gordon Ramsey yell at staff at restaurants he is trying to \"improve\" for providing bad service. Perhaps he needs to look at his own restaurants first."}
{"text":"After reading the Yelp reviews, we stopped by here and got some jalapeno poppers, beer and burgers. The burgers were really good, so was the beer. But two things stuck with me:  1. The milkshakes were just out of this world with the pudding on top. 2. When the waitress set the jalapeno popper shots down, she very casually mentioned \"Oh, and one of them is extra spicy, but it's a surprise\"."}
{"text":"Place was ok, burgers were good it's in Vegas and has a famous chefs name involved so it was packed and there were lines. Service was good, food was good, if it was not in Vegas it would not be as packed. However in Vegas you overpay and get average."}
{"text":"Best place we have eaten in Vegas.  Food is fresh and flavored.  Wait staff is friendly and attentive.  VERY good experience!"}
{"text":"The milkshakes are everything and some. Soooooo good. I got the creme brulee with I believe the coffee milkshake. The creme brulee, just like the others, sits as its own separate dessert on top of the milk shake. I know, sugar heaven. They also add sugar to their sweet potato fries that made them even more mouthwatering. The burger was good but you must under any and all circumstances get the milkshakes."}
{"text":"Great! They don't take reservations, and there was a line out the door when we arrived, but the line moved quickly. Wonderful hot dogs, a footlong at the least, all beef...despite the name, definitely my recommendation. My fiancé's burger was great as well, but I only had eyes for the hot dog!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere for dining not great due to being in the casino with views of slot machines and noise of quarters hitting their metal trays.  Restaurant itself was nicely laid out but line at door was less than welcoming.  Servers attire was cool and different although some of the servers literally SQUEEZED themselves into their outfits and did not look comfortable.  Our server, MIa, was absolutely great as she had a great attitude, was very knowledgeable about the menu, and conducted herself as a top notch representative of the establishment.  We started out with the pepper poppers, which were AMAZING!  The Hells Kitchen burgers were great and even better with the duck bacon.  The Oreo Cookie shake was the fave at our table but we all wished that all the shakes had less custard and more actual main flavor content. Truffle fries were also a huge hit.  All in all, a fun night with good food.  Price tag was a little steep at $130 but i went in expecting that.  I would go back but only on special occasions."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Burgr at Planet Hollywood to try a burger and compare to my favorite burger place.in Vegas,  Burger Bar,  in Mandalay Bay. Ends up ordering the Fish & Crisp Sandwich. Great choice for me. The batter was just right and the fish (cod) was very good. The saltiness of the dill tartar sauce with salt and vinegar crisps made it all go together with the roll that it was in. The cod was a very good sized piece and the presentation was good.  I also ordered the Honey - Pig Bao Buns and they were great. Roasted pork belly with honey hoisin sauce and cucumber,  radish and cilantro. Comes with three but I wanted more.  I asked for the buns to come first but both plates were served together. Took a bit for the order but worth the wait. I sat at the bar and server was friendly and quick to refill my ice tea.   I would order both plates again."}
{"text":"Visited January fourth for a late lunch. The hostesses were incredibly nice and seated us immediately. Our server Alex was quite friendly and talkative and explained the menu well and answered all our questions. Drinks were great and the onion ring batter DID NOT fall off when you bit into them which is a deal breaker for me. They were crisp and delicious. My daughter had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and I had the Fresno Chili dog. Now the hamburger was good, but the hotdog was fabulous. I could go for one right now! The burger was a little overcooked, she asked for medium rare and it was definitely medium.  The manager Derek came over to check on us and I was shocked at his sincerity and kindness. You just don't see that much in Vegas and it was really appreciated. He will make this restaurant work. Liked the servers outfits, the men's jeans had flames on the back pockets. It was a great experience. went into the pub, but I didn't like what I saw on people's plates. Just personal preference.  Having said that, we went to Gordon Ramsey Steak to look at the dinner menu and inquire about possible dinner reservations (this was January 3rd) and the three dinner hostesses (who should really be called out on this by management) would not give us the time of day! It was my daughter's 21st birthday and we are both fans of the show. We were dressed more than appropriately to inquire about reservations.  One actually snickered at us and they just turned around after shortly saying, we are booked and went into the restaurant. What about the next day girly???? I should have asked for the manager, but I already knew they would never see a dime of mine. So we went elsewhere and had a great time."}
{"text":"4 stars because it was absolutely delicious and worth it to try.  4 stars because the wait to sit was ridiculous and the service (although she was sweet) took foreverrrr. I would recommend trying it though, at least once!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Burgr is renowned for their flavorful burgers from the infamous Chef Gordon Ramsey of Hell's Kitchen.  Situated inside the Planet Hollywood hotel, I was looking forward to try the famous burgers.  We were seated In front of the flaming wall glass display which is a little warm if you are seated near it.  But nonetheless it was a great backdrop and added \"fire\" to the ambiance.  I ordered the  Hell's Kitchen burger and Parmesan onion rings.  Burger had some roasted jalapeños minus the spicy seeds and avocado on a sesame bun.  Onion rings were piping hot and large in size. Great flavor and had two sauces for dipping.  A chipotle infused ketchup and cheddar ranch dip.    PROs:  Flavorful beef patty that you could taste the quality of meat and extremely juicy.  Onion rings are good to share, very crispy, and served as an appetizer.  CONs:  I expected a little more from the resto surroundings, being that it was near the casino area, it was a little small and felt more like a bar location.  We had no plates to place our onion rings on as they were very hot and large in size to eat straight from the serving cone it came in.  I had high expectations from my burger and expected a little more. I added the side dipping sauces from my onion rings into my burger which added more of what I was looking for.  It would have been great to have some more cheese and more veggies in the burger as well."}
{"text":"Here in Vegas for my brothers 30th Birthday and just enjoyed a stellar dinner at Gordon Ramsay Steak the night before, we decided to hit up another great sounding spot. My brother and his Wife had been here before but it was a first time for my Wife and I. We decided to split a burger and went with the Hell's Kitchen Burger(asadero cheese,roasted jalapeño,avocado, and oven roasted tomato). This burger was one of the best I have ever had,VERY IMPRESSED..We got the Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings(parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip) to share with the table. Best onion rings I have ever tasted in my life!! We also tried the Gooey Fries, which were good but not as great as everything else. I can not wait to come here again!  Recap: Great Service Best Burger Ever Great sides Great Beer Very reasonable pricing for such great quality food."}
{"text":"Well besides the extremely long line and even longer wait...the food was okay but not top quality as I'd expect with a celebrity chef's name associated with it. I've tasted better tasting burgers at \"regular\" burger establishments in manhattan. The desert and French fries were delicious and the price points are affordable but I probably wouldn't go back given the extremely long wait (you stand in line btw) and average tasting burgers. I expect more especially when the place is named burgr!"}
{"text":"Long wait (and that seemed to be consistent) to get in, long service once you're in, but the burger is pretty damn good.  It definitely is a gourmet burger - don't expect that classic \"junk burger\" some of us crave before we head off to a burger joint.    I ordered the jalapeno burger which had just enough spice, and so much flavor.  The burgers here are reasonably sized, and I'm pretty sure I ate all of mine.  Buns (which are so important!) were perfect.   My boyfriend had the American burger, and that was equally as good.    Thennnn there are the fries. Not the biggest fan of truffle fries, so I can't say these are my favorite.  But the ketchup was a nice touch - curry ketchup and regular catchup to choose from.  I am a fan, but I would go elsewhere for a burger since the wait times here are a bit absurd."}
{"text":"Food is very good Service is good  Might be a wait to get in but worth it I suggest the chefs bar.  Good time"}
{"text":"The service was slow. The fries were $8 and definitely not worth it. They were cold and the ketchup was nasty."}
{"text":"The truffle fries were decent! (3/5)  The Blue burger was nothing special! (1/5)  The American burger was a little better! (3/5)  Overall....overpriced for the quality of the food, I would have rather paid $40 to just have Gordon yell at me than to have spent that amount on the above listed items!"}
{"text":"I can not speak highly enough about the sweet potato fries. Our entire group could not get enough! The truffle fries were also cooked well and had fantastic flavor. I really enjoyed my burger (the Euro). The toppings were rich and flavorful. I would have liked the meat seasoned slightly more, but that is my only suggestion. We were all very happy and would gladly return!"}
{"text":"The overall design and ambiance is fantastic. The food was good. I loved my Hell's Kitchen burger. My dad's Uber Cheese Burger, my mom's Farm burger and my brother's Hog burger are all cooked to perfection. My mom's Farm burger is especially tasty with duck breast beacon. The sweet potato fries came a bit on the cold side but the honey jalapeño mayo was delicious.   The only reason I gave it a four star instead of five is service being a bit slower than expected. Overall experience was great. The digital survey that comes along with your bill is a great touch showcases Chef Ramsay's commitment to quality.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome food... great vibe... good service... wait is long at times... but definitely worth it.."}
{"text":"The Euro Burger was one of the most amazing burgers I have ever had!!!! The service was exceptional- they were so quick and efficient! And overall really friendly!!! Our server's name was Edward and he was awesome!! will for sure be coming back here and enjoying the awesome shakes too!! I'm not a big fan of onion rings but they were delicious here too!"}
{"text":"First, sometimes you have to expect looooong line ever.  you need to wait at least an hour to eat a \"burger\" Second, the price is too expensive. I agree this is a good burger but not worth $20 including tips.  Third, just to give some tips, hells kitchen is crazy hot. be careful if you are not good at spicy. all fries were good, but once again, it is way too expensive for \"just fries\""}
{"text":"'BurGR' was our last stop of the 3 Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas.  Of the three GR locations in Las Vegas, this was the most casual and touristy.  We were prepared to wait in the long line to eat here, but since we had a party of 4 we were able to put our name down and come back later via a text message notification.    We started the meal with onion rings and truffle fries.  Both were excellent; especially the two sauces which accompanied the appetizers (truffle aioli, ketchup (regular and chipotle)).  I had the Farm Burger: Cheddar cheese burger with a fried egg and duck bacon.  Delicious.  Cooked perfectly (medium) with a pint of Innis and Gunn."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had so far! I had the farm burger. Excellent! And the duck bacon?! Oh my goodness! So good! Had the truffle fries as well and they were delicious!"}
{"text":"I dnk how to say this .   Best  Burger  EVER  Tried the euro and the Hell's Kitchen one .   Oh and the truffle fries ?? Amazing..."}
{"text":"#GordonRamsay BurGR was too noisy for conversation. Very crowded, long wait, okay service, cute uniforms - like what burger waitresses would wear on the Enterprise. Enjoyed the truffle oil fries and my portobello mushroom burger. Liked the technology - texting guests for table instead of getting those vibrating coaster things. Also using an iPad as a menu ... very expensive for a burger place. They were good, but not THAT good. It was #MarchMadness that week, so but what's to be expected? Doubt I'll return at $60 for a very basic burger dinner, but glad we checked it out."}
{"text":"Good price.  Good Food. Good Service. Ramsay done good!  One of the greatest burgers I've eaten.  Got seated right away at 4:30 on 10/22/15. Hostess was friendly and our waitress, Katie was very attentive.  Ordered Jalapeño Popper ($11). Too bready for my taste, but husband loves them. The Farm Burger ($14) is simply flavorful. Thick patty, fantastic duck breast bacon and perfectly runny egg. And I would run just to have the Parmessan Truffle Fries ($10). The fries are crunchy on the outside and velvety smooth inside. Perfectly paired with their aioli.  We also ordered 2 cocktails.  Not really worth the mention.   Overall, a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Best burger i have ever had.  Fresh ingredients with a burger patty that was expertly prepared.  Fries were very good, although a bit chewy. Might be the intent.  Came in the afternoon. No wait at all. Food was served quickly.   Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was deterred by line and finally planned an early dinner just so I could give it a try.  Had Brittania Burger and although bun and side was very good, they didn't make up for my disappointment in the burger itself.  Maybe I expected too much but as some have commented, there's little flavor via meat or grill.  Topped by many places in Sacramento and I'm sure in Vegas.  Sorry but seems too much went into the decor and big name and not enough in what's being served."}
{"text":"I would add this to my list of favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  The interior is awesome and the furniture is awesome.  Very comfy dining chairs that is unlike most restaurants because I would always rather have booth seats, but this restaurant did well to make every table awesome.    And the food was memorable enough for me to write a review.  It did not matter if it has Gordon Ramsy's name on it or not, the Burger was awesome and had culinary attributes.  This burger definitely tasted better than any chain restaurant burger and alot more memorable.  So the slightly higher price was worth it, but since all food in Vegas is expensive and you could easily pay $10+ for a quick lame burger at some quick food spot by a hotel pool, I think this place was a good value.  Burgers here are only around $15, but it will  taste alot better than any burger you order for room service or by the hotel pool.    2 burgers & sharing 1 fries with my friend (2 people) came out to $41.  Yeah that might sound expensive for burger & fries, but for a culinary experience to experience great food in an awesome environment it's a great value.   At around $20 a person, I think it's a good value especially that we were eating on the Las Vegas strip.    For a Las Vegas restaurant that will provide an actual experience, this is probably one of the coolest restaurants you will spend less money at."}
{"text":"The burger were okay, nothing special.  The fries were good.  The waitress SUCK.. They were rude.  We wanted to sit in a booth but was told they were for a party of 4 or more.  As we sat at a small kiddie like table I noticed there was 2 people who were sitting in the same booth that I asked for.  The line was long but the wait wasn't that bad.  This is a place to go one time, just to say you went there.  I advise you to not leave a tip because the servers are rude.."}
{"text":"Beware of the \"Hog Burger\"  During my recent stay in Las Vegas, we stopped at \"Ramsy Burgr\" for lunch and I ordered the Hog Burger.  The waitress told me they were served medium (lightly pink inside) and since I never had one before I accepted this.  When the \"burger\" arrived and I took my first bite! I thought it to be awfully rare and not necessarily tasty.  After a couple more bites I started to be concerned that I was eating raw pork, so I pinch a bit of the meat in the center of what remained and indeed it was a raw as raw can be! Yuck! The waitress confirmed my concern immediately and returned five minutes or so later with a new burger.  By that time my appetite was gone, concerned a food born illness was in my future!  Can you say trichinosis?  One would think if your business is to prepare and \"cook\" food, one would be \"good\" at it, especially a burger place.  Heck , I am no chef, but I can out cook most restaurants these days with their tasteless expensive creations!   Anyway, the \"cooked\" hog burger was not worth the wait and I found the apple butter and arugula as toppings to be conflicting tastes.  Also, no accommodations were made to our check for this inconvenience.  I would not return again, but others at the table seemed satisfied with their meals.  Nice location on the strip and connected to Hard Rock Hotel. Pricey for what you get, but inline with Las Vegas these days."}
{"text":"This was the first place we decided to eat during our Vegas vacation. I think the food was good but not mouth watering, mind blowing amazing. There have been several restaurants I have been to where I can't even believe how good the food tastes. You know, the kind of food where you feel like you're going to melt into your seat with every bite. BurGR wasn't like that for me and I think I was expecting that. It really didn't taste any better than some other decently good burger places I've been to. I think my expectations were huge considering who's restaurant this is and how we're big fans of his.  My boyfriend absolutely loved his Hell's Kitchen burger. I had the American burger but changed it to swiss (actually they didn't have swiss but gave me a similar cheese instead) and added mushrooms. It was good but nothing amazing.  Also we did have the Maui onion rings; those were delicious!  My boyfriend may not agree with my 3 star review and demand I should give 4 or even 5 stars but he has a Yelp account and can write his own review, this was my experience. I would go back, yes, but next time I hope my burger is a bit better, maybe instead of getting a classic burger I should have opted for one of the specialty ones."}
{"text":"Second time here and hate to say that my first experience was better? Doesn't matter because it was still amazing and I love love love Gordon Ramsay burgers sooo much! It's still one of the best burgers ever!!!   We couldn't have been anymore excited to break lent and eat bread/fried foods again! Lolll. So we started with the Jalapeno Poppers, Truffle Fries, and the Gooey Fries! I ordered an off the menu item - Gordon Burger w/ an egg! The BF ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger! Everything was SO. FREAKING. GOOD.   We couldn't finish either of the fries so we brought that back and those were wonderful munchies! I liked the truffle fries better but the bf preferred the gooey fries so I'm glad we ordered both lol!   Everything here is amazing! I will always make a point to come back here anytime I'm in Vegas! Good thing this place is far from home because I'd turn into a buffalo & I'm not sure how I feel about dropping nearly a bill for burgers and chips?"}
{"text":"It was our time here and we ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Truffle Fries! The burger was decent size and the fries were huge. My boyfriend and I shared these and got full off of them! Overall, everyone was really friendly and our waiter was extremely helpful! :)"}
{"text":"Service is impressive I was  turned arround in the restaurant as it was a very busy weekend. I was welcomed by the manager Micheal who personally made sure I was seated and comfortable. Then my server followed the same suit after that. Food  was amazing and cocktail was great. I  enjoyed the whole experience."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the service was horrid. Our waiter, Chris, handed us an iPad to look over the drink menu.  He returned about 10-15 minutes later to learn that we were not even interested in ordering drinks.  He took our food order and he never returned again.  Our food took at least 45 minutes to arrive.  We had to flag him down to get our check.  We saw him check on other tables throughout our visit, but he never even asked us how our meal was.  Someone else brought us our drinks, delivered our very late food and even delivered our check.  We walked past him leaving and he looked at us and he didn't say thank you or anything.  We were really excited to try this place and waited a long time for the table just to be treated completely irrelevantly by our server."}
{"text":"BURGR  There are TVs, music is not to loud, Decor is modern. No outside seating, lots of drink and beer selection, parking at miracle mile then walking in towards  north is easiest to find it  Ordered the Gordon. Not on menu yet. It was good. Different from the usual beef patty. My friend ordered the farm burger and it looked excellent. I should of ordered that, but wanted to try something new.   Truffle Parmesan Fries We're good. The dipping sauces were great. Fries weren't over done but soft.   Jalapeño Poppers  We're great, dipping sauce was good. Breading wasn't to thick was just right.   Service was great. Waitress got our order in fast since we were in a rush. Service still excellent. Gratuity was already added to our check since we had a big party"}
{"text":"This wasnt bad at all. It WAS pricey, of course. I liked how they cut the fries. Steak fry style. They burgers were not over sized..which is good and bad. Good, because i was able to finish it all. Bad, because i paid an arm and a leg for it."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries (I got the Euro Burger with truffle fries) with a casual setting. Felt very comfortable and will definitely need to go again the next time in town!"}
{"text":"Burgers are juicy, kale salad essentially had minimal kale leaves, waited 20 minutes (still waiting..) for the check, our waitress was a lot nicer to the Caucasian group a few tables away.. Had better expectations."}
{"text":"We came here in 2013 and really enjoyed everything, after trying a second time 3 years later we won't be coming back. The staff were great and the atmosphere nice (minus the weird Ramsey photo on the wall and menu). The food was really just ok. I had the euro burger and my husband had the chanterelle burger.. ingredients were good, good meat, but somehow was dry and missing cohesion. The fries though were terrible! They were inedible without ketchup because they were so freaking dry! And although the curry ketchup was really tasty, the other basically tasted like blended tomatoes with no other flavor. We left still hungry because we gave up trying to eat them. Add to this the absolutely terrible dresses he makes those poor girls wear, the stained napkins, the poor craft beer selection (30 on tap and one good IPA), and the plates looking really worn(the logo was almost rubbed off of mine) and it just doesn't feel loved there anymore. Time for Gordon to fix his own place! Go to Holstein's if you want a killer burger and beer in Vegas."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Such unique toppings and flavours. Melt in your mouth burgers.  I also love the name......very creative!"}
{"text":"BurGR!!  I wanted so badly to love this restaurant but sadly I am only able to give it 4 stars. Firstly the hostess sat us quickly as it was 12:45am, and although the seating was limited there were seats available. The waiter came over and introduced himself and the fancy iPad drink and dessert menu. He was very nice and excited and helpful! When I wanted a beer and didn't know which to have he offered to bring me a sample of the two most popular to chose from, and informed me that if those didn't work out we would try some more. Free beer tasting? Sure! I needed up loving both of the selections he brought out, but went with the apple ale.  I ordered the Uber cheese burger expecting something creamy and mild while  little sharp. I thought this would go well with my apple ale.  After about 25 minutes our order came out. My uncle had the American burger and I was being served the chicken burger. I quickly informed e server that I had ordered the Uber burger and he apologized and assured that would be out very quickly. Meanwhile out waiter also comes by to check on my food that was missing. After about 3 minutes another burger is being served to our table. This time the server and the waiter both come bearing a maytag blue cheese burger with arugula. The waiter goes to his computer and then confirms with me that I had ordered the blue cheese. Not wanting to complain and not wanting to wait more for a cheese burger I agreed. The arugula looked compelling, so I decided to try a blue cheese burger for the first time.  All in all the burger was great. It was perfectly medium, the truffle parmesan fries were awesome, and my uncle liked his burger as well. The blue cheese was a bit rich for me so I only ate half my burger, but that is to be expected of blue cheese.   Overall the experience was amazing. I loved the atmosphere and I loved the menu selections! (and the menu is a souvenir so score!) I was given the wrong burger simply because the restaurant was a little loud because of a band playing right on the other side of the wall. I'm sure my burger would have been awesome, just like everything else on the menu!   Breakdown:           Staff/hostess--- 5 stars!           Waiter (Michael? Or something..) --- 5 stars!          Menu--- 5 stars!          Noise level--- 4 stars!   I wish I could give you 4.5 stars but I can't so 4 it is! I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"LOVE GR! so, since we couldnt afford his steakhouse, we opted for lunch at Burgr.   The real flames on the sign were pretty cool. Fiiiiiiiiire! then there was a line forming with a sign that said \"do not wait here until you check in with the hostess\".  so, we left line to do just that.  after waiting to speak to the hostess, she said \"oh yeah you just wait in the line\".  ok..... Now we lost our place in line! annoying! the wait wasnt too bad tho (theyre lucky).  we were seated.  all the waiters and waitresses were good looking.  funny, he only wants good looking ppl working for him.  eh, dont blame him but i didnt think the women's uniform was very nice.  they were one piece tight ass short ass dresses.  all the men waiters wore his personal line of jeans with a gold \"GR\" on the back pockets.  Our waiter comes.  very friendly.  everyone smiled, ask how your day was going, etc. then a young man approaches us because he sees my husband's Sabres hat.  He asked if we were from Buffalo.  We said yes, chatted a little, he asked what we were in Vegas for and we told him for our 20th anniversary.  he congratulated us and told us he was one of the managers there. I thought he was just a guest! then 1 minute later our waiter comes with 2 glasses of champagne! very nice touch GR!  food did take a bit to come out but it was very good! overall very nice place.  Glad to have had at least something from one of Chef Ramsey's places!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, appetizers, and beer ....The service is great and everything comes in a reasonable amount of time. Strange there isn't a desert menu, hmmm. ..location is right in the thick of it on the strip....park over at the Bellagio for free for an hour, too."}
{"text":"If you plan on eating at BURGR, go hungry.  I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsay so I was already really intrigued by the restaurant. the vibe there is cool. The food is great, and the price is good for how you get.   The burgers can be a little pricey but they are definitely worth it. They make sure to cook the meat to your liking. If you are with a few people, I would only get one fry as they come with a lot.  Everytime I go to Vegas I go to BURGR and this last time I found out the Jalapeño Poppers are no longer on the menu. I was heavily disappointed. The employees there told me that there were a lot of people who were upset by this. It may sound dramatic to not go there anymore because of this but they really were THAT GOOD. I hope that they'll reconsider putting them back on the menu."}
{"text":"yum!!   We came here around 6pm, no line so we got seated immediately. I love how simple the menu is, it makes decision making a lot easier!! Once you've settled in and got a chance to look at the menu, your server comes over with an iPad and does a little presentation of what they recommend on getting. Pretty cool because you get to see the pictures!   We got the farm burger (how can you say no to fried egg!), their special burger that's not on the menu, some truffle fries and a shake number 4! The burgers were pretty bomb. The duck bacon adds a very nice flavor to the burger, definitely enjoyed that!! I loved how the buns were so crispy, when you bite into your burger you can hear the crunch! The burger wasn't heavy, at least it didn't leave me feeling heavy. The fries were okay, personally I'm not a huge truffle fan so I can't comment on that but they do give you a generous portion. It's a good size for two people to share. Lastly but most importantly, THE SHAKE! The shake was so soooo delicious I almost wanted a second one!!! I got the shake with creme brûlée pudding and Oreo shake. Can you say match made in heaven? I wish shake was brought out lastly as a dessert but that was my fault for not mentioning that, will have to make a mental note so it won't happen again next time.   Overall the food was delicious, service was great (even though it took them almost 30 mins to get our food out). Will have to come back and try their appetizers, other burger selections and more shake!"}
{"text":"5 stars. I've been to this restaurant twice during my stay in Las Vegas. There is permanently a queue outside this restaurant. Fortunately if you are in party of 3 or more, simply skip the queue and go straight to the waitress at the front, give them your contact details and the number of people in your group and go shop around. They will drop you a SMS when your table is almost ready. This saves about 2 hours of agony waiting in line.   Everything about this restaurant is overwhelming. From the deliberate fire decor to the iconic face of gordon ramsay in on the menu, till how the burgers sre presented. Everything is a positive experience. I've tried the classic American burger and the Euro Burger. The verdict? Given the choice, i will never eat another burger from a Fast food chain anymore. Go for the truffle fries, everytime and anytime. You can dhare it with at least 2 more people in your party. If you ever run out of the dips, go ahead and ask the waiter to bring you more. They didn't charge me extra for the dips the 2 times i was there. Always leave some space to share the sticky toffee ice cream with your best friend. They come in a pair!   Did i mention you can get yourself pretty stuffed for about 25 dollars? That is including of a drink and a shared fries.   25bucks? That's just a hand of blackjack for most people in Las Vegas. Save yourself the agony of losing a hand. Take that 25 bucks, and go to eat at this place. I promise you, you will never regret following my advice."}
{"text":"An amazing burger!!! I got the hells kitchen and it was so yummy! Fries are to die for as well. Portions are big and we were stuffed!!!  So tasty!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome service. Awesome food. Couldn't ask for more. Must try this place out. The workers know what Ramsay wants in service and food. Meets his standards. Don't miss out. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of burgers and this for sure is absolutely one of the best. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger which was really good, the mellow asadero cheese went really well with the spicy jalapeno and the sweet oven roasted tomato.  I asked for extra truffle aioli which went really god on this burger.  My wife had the Euro burger and she also said it was one of the best she has ever had.  Yes, the beef is great, perfectly cooked but the soft brioche buns are really what puts the B in BURGR here.  (get it, B for Bun... haha, yeah ok).  The truffle fries were very good, seasoned perfectly, steak-cut and yet still crispy.  Enough for two to share.  Then... the coffee shake.  Yes, you have to try their \"shakes\" they are so different than anything you have ever had.  The coffee one starts with a coffee \"shake\" (blended ice cream) in a tall glass with a very large dollop of hazelnut (think mild nutella) pudding on the top.  It was incredible, also big enough to share after having had the burgers.  Very nice staff, good service and recommendations. We'll be back whenever in Vegas.   Nice job GR.  I have been to several \"Celebrity Chef\" restaurants in Vegas and most are just 'meh', if that.  This was great food, great service, great atmosphere and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Poor quality food. We ordered medium, but hamburger patty was overcooked. I saw same reviews in here. Just name value. Store manager should focus on or do not ask. Beer was not cold enough. Serving was average. Little crowed... Disappointed..."}
{"text":"Great place- cool atmosphere and delicious food. We got here on a Tuesday at 1145am and waited about 10 minutes to be seated although bar seats were available if we wanted.  The appetizers were amazing! The onion rings were the best I've ever had. The chipotle and curry ketchup were super flavorful! We ordered a shake #1 to go and wow-sugar explosion but amazing! My bf ordered the britianna burger medium and loved it. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger substituted meat for portobello patty . Honestly I would love if they actually had a veggie patty instead. It was really good and I love that you can substitute any of the burgers for meat free but a regular veggie patty would be much easier to eat. They put double portobello on there which was actually too much and made the burger fall apart and hard to eat. It was still really good I'm not complaining about that .  Worth trying for sure!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! The sesame seed buns are so yummy and the truffle fries are delicious. If you have a Total Rewards VIP pass you can skip the line and be seated immediately. All the burgers are good and the fish sandwich though hard to eat is very good too. Gotta try the push pop deserts!"}
{"text":"This place was yummy! good food, good service, hot waittress! wait time can be up to two hours but you can leave your cell number and they text you when you table is ready. thumbs up."}
{"text":"awesome place my wife and I loved the food and the customer service.. we will eat here when he come back to los Vegas.. burger are  awesome an their fires and onions rings"}
{"text":"When I find myself in times of trouble, Gordon Ramsay comes to me speaking words of wisdom:  http://66.media.tumblr.com/ee617abca164ed2d330b4c0c6efce2eb/tumblr_mwccysjCbF1qhelj9o1_250.gif    ...Then there's meaning to life and food once again.  There's no denying, Gordon Ramsay really knows how to entice those passing by at BurGR.   Beginning at the entrance of the venue with its 30-foot-long fire display, to the keg showcase, to the brightly colored walls to overhead high-definition TVs, the atmosphere is as exciting as the menu itself!  As anyone would with Chef Ramsay, I came in here with really high expectations. I was yearning for the \"wow\" factor. If anyone has watched Hell's Kitchen before, you'll distinctly know Gordon Ramsay as that chef who loves talking shit to everyone's face. The one who is highly critical of their dishes and who would make one re-think why they're really in the kitchen. By trying out BurGr, I wanted to know for sure that Chef Ramsay was't all talk, and boy was I completely blown away!  *whoooshhhh!!!  During my visit, I decided to try the Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg ($13) which consisted of roasted fresno pepper, jalapeños, cheddar cheese, avocado,  red onion, and chipotle ketchup.   Seriously?   Why would a hot dog ever cost thirteen bucks?!   All of my questions were quickly answered after just ONE bite. I kid you not, this has to be the best hot dog I've ever had in my freakin' life. The pepper, the jalapeños, the red onion, the chipotle ketchup....there's nothing like it. It's like...biting into God's essence. Yep, that good, folks! The hot dog itself, tender, flavorful, boosted with so much flavor from the toppings that engulf it.   Hands down!   ...I've found my happy place in Vegas.  In addition to the Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg, I also requested for a side of Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11).  ...OKAY - you're probably thinking \"super basic\", right?   NOT!  These Truffle fries, made from fresh hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, and truffle aïoli were nothing NEAR basic.   I'm talking 'bout perfectly prepared fries engulfed in caramelized truffle aïoli and topped with parmesan cheese. The photo I took below cannot even do any justice as to how superb this appetizer truly is.   I wish they can expand BuGR over to Northern California so I can enjoy it more often, but this is what keeps my feenin' to go back to Vegas for moar!  I have such a newfound respect for Gordon Ramsay, moreso than before. If you have not yet tried this place out, hurry the hell up! YOU'RE MISSING OUT!!  +Menu: https://www.caesars.com/content/dam/phv/Dining/Casual/burgr/GRBurgerMenu%20(3).pdf  +Pro tip: If you're in a party of two, speak with the hostess. You might get a shorter wait time!! (You didn't hear it from me, though!)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The atmosphere is great. The food was excellent the combination of flavors was magic in my mouth. The forest burger was amazing. The duck bacon and wild mushrooms were a great touch and enhanced the overall flavor of the burger. You can taste the quality of the ingredients. Let's just say I enjoyed it. The service was excellent. I will definitely be returning and telling everyone I know hey have to try this place."}
{"text":"I had the hog burger and my wife had the hells kitcheb burger. It was so big and good for a good price. I ordered an iced tea with lemon and drank a lot of it. I think i got 3 refills before we ordered.  I would recommend anyone that is near Planet Hollywood to go in and give it a try. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"had the farm burger .....and oreo shake...........shake is about 4 stars.........but the burger was just okay..........nothin special ...........might be back"}
{"text":"Nothing special. My expectations were so high because of Gordon Chef. I was thinking that it would be the best burger of my life, but it is not. The milk shakes are very unique, but the burger by itself is too dry."}
{"text":"Average all around.  Onion rings undercooked as are the fries.  Wings are not spicy at all.  Burgers were all served at same temperature despite varying orders.  Non-memorable taste.  Good beer selection.  Burger buns are a highlight.  Won't return."}
{"text":"We decided to try BurGR for my sons 18th he loves burgers and shakes , was a bit worried cause the reviews are all over the place . We arrived at 5pm , no line yay ! But the line up got very long while we were eating FYI . Hostesses were not friendly , not overly helpful at the beginning or the end ( as I'm on crutches the security said when we were done to have the hostesses call and they would bring a wheelchair to make it easier on me , they weren't happy I had asked them to call ) . Our server was ok , not the most amazing but not terrible either so I consider that a win .  We ordered the Maui rings they were good and the sauces were good try the jalapeño ketchup . We ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, Truffle burger , and the American burger , they were good not the best burgers we've eaten and for the price they should have been . It's $14-21 just for a burger you order your sides like fries separate @$10 each  , so really it's a $25 burger . We ordered the truffle fries and the sweet potato fries it was a lot of fries more then enough for 3 to share , the truffle fries were just ok but the sweet potato fries were amazing ( more of a desert ) . Our son ordered a shake and it was amazing , a bit weird but so good . I was a bit disappointed they didn't do anything for our sons birthday , most restaurants do but that's ok we had a good time . We spent $120 on 3 people , 1 appetizer,  3 burgers , two sides and 1 shake.  I think I probably wouldn't spend money to eat here again but I would order shakes to go ."}
{"text":"Lost for words...Wendy our server was great. The food is unbelievable. To pay $16 for a burger from the great Gordon Ramsay almost feels like a rip off on his part. The best burger I've ever had. And this is coming from a huge burger enthusiast from California. Keep up the amazing work."}
{"text":"Ramsay.. if I didn't love you and respect you, this reviewed would be lowered to probably 3 stars.   FOOD: Burgers were great and distinctive. They have the traditional cheeseburger, but you can expect a nice twist with Ramsay's flare. I did ask for medium rare, but the burger came back medium well. In this case, I usually ask for a remake, but continue reading for the reason why I didn't..  AMBIANCE: Interesting racer/diner concept. All servers were girls who wore mini skirt tight dresses. I guess it's vegas right? I feel sort of bad for them.. I'm sure working in that is not easy.   SERVICE: This is where things fell apart. Come on Ramsay.. you have a show called Restaurant Nightmares... and this was a nightmare. First 5 minutes were great, but then we realized it took an hour to get our burger. Some people came after us with larger parties and got food before us. I know I know... we could of gotten something harder to make right? Wrong. We ordered 15 minutes earlier than a table, and they received their fries 10 minutes before us. I was drooling as the waitress came towards our table only the realized it wasn't for us. Yeah that kind of sucked. Then she did the same thing with the burgers. So when my burger came out medium well instead of medium rare. EFFF it, I was not gonna wait another hour and needed those carbs now!  PARKING: Since it's in the Planet Hollywood, parking is free and easy.   Overall: I hope the service improves and the meat is cooked properly, other than that... it was a nice place in Planet Hollywood and I'm always down for a good burger."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers.   Every time I go to LV I have to stop here. Gordon Ramsay, you have a way with burgers that's for sure!!! The menu is simple, to the point, and offers a selection of specialty burgers that are also simple, but amazing. The way he pairs such easy ingredients to become amazing burger toppings is ridiculous. I would recommend trying the mango chutney and arugula burger.  As well as this, they also have PUDDING MILKSHAKES. Yes you heard me right. They're amazing. I honestly want one right now.  You can see into the kitchen the meticulous process that goes into making the burgers. There is even a taste tester at the end of the line, and if the burger isn't perfect, it's not sent out. But somehow, the time doesn't drag on because of this. But watching the cooks you can see that they're all working like a fine tuned machine.  The service is usually pretty good. Only thing I would change is the god awful outfits these poor girls have to squeeze themselves into. Kinda dropped the ball there!"}
{"text":"It was my first time in Vegas and my girl and I wanted to be touristy for a day; Enter Gordon Ramsay BurGR  The place itself is pretty nice. It's not terribly big, but it's not super crowded either. We went about getting the Uber burger. It was so good!!! We split the burger in two and always went about getting some side to go along with it. The burger was very juicy and always cooked to perfection. The bread that accompanied it was also very good. The cheese was absolutely incredible. So good, that we came back a second time and ordered it again! The gooey fried, a side sounded very good in theory, and actually also looked very good, however, the fries that came with the toppings were a little on the cold side. The service was fair. Our waitress Ginger was pretty nice, and actually went about recognizing us the second time we came around, which was nice.   Overall; everything was tasty, service was fair, and the wait wasn't terribly long when we had to wait. When we come back to Vegas, this will be a stop"}
{"text":"The fries were nothing special, but the Euro burger was amazing! It was absolutely worth the $16. Go early to avoid the crowd crunch.  I took off a point because there was a booth of loud, rowdy drunk ladies near us. The noise level was already high, but their incessant screeching was disturbing. Someone should have spoken to them."}
{"text":"I am number 3,688 review for BurGR.   I doubted what the big deal was over the burgers of this place.  I would never wait in line more than an hour for food...not even 30 minutes.  I found that my friend Takamichi has a Total Rewards card that make us look like celebs walking past the line and we never waited for more than ten minutes.  I finally had their food.   I cannot believe how freakingly awesomely insane the food is here! From the appetizers to the burgers. Wow just wow wow wee wow!  I am a happy person! But sad when I took my last bite.  I want Yelpers to know that You should try BurGR."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!!  Food was fantastic! I suggest trying all the different sauces for the fries, since they were all great. Server was Kaysea and it was the best service at a restaurant in a long time!"}
{"text":"I don't know .. I had high hopes coming in and I didn't think the burgers were too impressive. I definitely had better burgers at local places elsewhere. Their fries were good though. The service could do better. It took forever to get our water, our food and our check. It was a meh experience for me."}
{"text":"Walked all over Planet Hollywood to find this place!  We ordered the American Burger w/ mushrooms added (extra $3 charge), the Hell's Kitchen Burger and just fries. The burgers were on point! Just be sure to ask for some ranch on the side for the Hell's Kitchen Burger to help cool down the spiciness.  The only bad things I have to say about our experience were that the fries were pretty stale, the waitress didn't bother to ask if we were Total Rewards members (not that $1-$2 off really matters that much), and we were up charged $3 for mushrooms--which they totally forgot to add to the burger...really?!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were craving burgers and we ended up coming here. I got one of their chicken burgers and it was so yummy! The chicken patty was juicy and flavorful. The burger just tasted fresh and the server shared with us that they use high grade beef. Everyone else in my party got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and they loved it! I also got the Truffle Parmesan fries. They were ok.. Could have been crispier. I wanted something sweet and was suggested to get the shake with oreos in it. Super sweet, but delish! Another cool thing about this place is that they make their own house ranch and catsup. Wish they sold their catsup by the bottle.   Overall, if you're craving for a big juicy burger, check this place out! Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Good. But not amazing. No BBQ sauce (at a burger joint?!) truffle fries were yum. The Hell's Kitchen burger had ONE jalapeño that wasn't even spicy... Thanks I'll pass. The blue cheese burger with arugula had better flavor. Could have had more blue cheese on it (skimpy with those toppings). Cocktails were meh... And house water tastes like cleaning supplies (perhaps the machine they run th glasses through?). Have had better burgers at mom and pop shops."}
{"text":"Don't go here on an empty stomach and you will love this place. We waited about 45 minutes to get a table for 2, soon as we were seated the line outside moved super fast (oh Murphy!). I did not care much for the earth burger, it was good but tasted bland, and surely not worth 15$? My husband loved the farm burger and our drinks and truffle fries were really good, so mixed feelings overall. P.S: whats the deal with \"gordon ramsay burgr\" t shirts and caps on sale outside? Do people really buy those?"}
{"text":"I give this place 3.5 stars. I marked it a four rather than a three because of that friggin awesome push pop dessert. So I arrived on Friday at around 6pm and there was a line along the restaurant at Planet. We ended up waiting a good 45 minutes before getting seated and you can definitely avoid that huge line at weird times like in the morning or late dinner.   Farm burger- $15 for duck breast bacon and fried egg. This burger was alright. I shared this and it was enough since we ordered fries. The egg is barely existent and the meat was ok. I guess I am not much of a burger person but when something is good, I know wassup. This wasnt quite up to par.  Truffle Parmesan Fries- Hmm nothing special about these again. The fries were a bit soggy and I just wanted crispy. THere is some cheese sprinkled on top and there is truffle sauce and ketchup. I opted for the ketchup so that was a waste in ordering this.  Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops- OMG bombbbb. This thing saved my meal and I was soo happy. It comes with two for $7 and at first I thought it was weird to be pudding but it really just is peanut butter ice cream with cake pieces in between. Delicious!! I love peanut butter and cake so these were the perfect size and so yummy. I wanted to get another round before I left for Vegas but that would be too gluttonous.  **TIPS** 1) Come at awkward times if you do not want to wait 45min-1 hour. I didnt see a line around 11am or 9pm or so. 2) Do without the fries and get the Push Up Pops!!! 3) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After having an awesome meal at Gordon Ramsey Steak we thought we'd try out BurGR.  First up there was a 20 minute wait for a table of 2.  They don't take reservations, so that was a bit annoying.    Once seated the service was good. No complaints there.  I did think the interior space could have been punched up a bit.  It seemed a bit Food Court like for my taste.  I really did not need to see a GIANT pic of Ramsey my entire meal.  The food was OK.  Honestly it did not taste any better then any other special burger place I've eaten (comparison would be Flip by Richard Blais).  We ordered the jalapeno poppers, which were good, but a bit cold. The burgers them self just left a bland feeling afterward.  My Partner ordered the American Burger recommended by the server and did not finish it because he felt it was tasteless.  I ordered the Bleu cheese burger and It was just a bleu cheese taste to it.    For $100 I would have expected more.  We had 3 cocktails 2 burgers and fries for that amount.  I would not go back, I actually debated on 2 stars, but felt bad because the staff was nice.  Really I guess a rating for me would have been 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is EXPENSIVE. It was a novelty to try a Gordon Ramsay burger, in fact I even gave this place a 2nd chance after being disappointed the first time. That's how much I wanted to like this place.  The presentation of the food was great but the flavor was just plain boring. It didn't have any unique flavor. It was just average. Also, both times I visited, I asked for the burger to be cooked rare, but got medium-rare. Not a deal breaker but when you are paying $15 for just the burger with no fries included, you expect to be able to get it cooked right.   Honestly, Carl's Jr., Wendy's & In & Out make better burgers. Each fast food joint has a unique flavor to their burgers, but Gordon Ramsey just refuses to take any chances. It all tastes bland even though it looks like it's going to taste amazing.  I spent over $55 on myself for a burger, fries, shake and beer with tip. Not to mention it is hard as hell to get to this restaurant unless you are walking along the strip. You have to park behind the Miracle Mile shops and walk all the way through the shopping mall to get back to the strip. Not an easy ordeal.  I don't recommend this place for locals. It's clearly aimed at the impulsive tourists. Nothing more than a cash grab for Gordon Ramsay."}
{"text":"Ramsay, you did not disappoint! BurGR is one of those places that MADE my Vegas experience. This place seriously gave me one of the best burgers I've ever had! The burger creations were as eclectic as the place itself; the Farm burger being my favorite. The parmesan truffle fries were flippin' amazing, but it's best to share because they give you a lot of them (and you'll save on your bill!). Yes, BurGR isn't cheap, but the experience is well worth it. STEAK, you're next!"}
{"text":"We Came here very excited for my husbands birthday because we love Gordon so much but unfortunately that day the food was just okay--  the burgers we received were bland and cold and the garlic fries we so oily that we didn't even eat them. We sat down for nearly 25 mins before our server even approached us and he was so rude. He spilt beer on our table and just walked away in a hurry. I notified the manager because after waiting so long and getting crap service we still were ignored and he looked annoyed. Don't know if we would be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Delicious burger. Loved the truffle parmesan fries. Service was slow and the kitchen was backed up (ie empty drinks and 30 minutes for a burger)."}
{"text":"Holy shit!  Brilliant burgers and fries."}
{"text":"The short: If you feel like waiting in a REALLY long line for some decent food and to say you at at a celebrity chef's place then this is for you.   The long: I should start by saying I have eaten at some of Gordon's other restaurants that are NOT in Vegas. This is by far the most affordable of them all and it shows. For starters there is a line halfway around the strip to get in here. There was no way in hell I was waiting 1+hrs for a burger Gordon or not. Luckily we managed a seat at the bar so we got right in. The staff is busy busy busy so don't expect great and personable service. They will do their job and nothing extra. The food is just okay, but this is a burger place so what were you expecting? The noise level is through the roof so be prepared to scream to the person across the table from you if you want conversation. Honestly the best part of the meal was the sticky toffee pudding which my wife got for dessert. It came in a pushpop style with ice cream which is different from his other locations. Honestly if you want a cheap Gordon Ramsay meal this is where you will get it. If you want a gourmet meal from a celebrity chef 1. be prepared to pay for it and 2. there are a TON of them in Vegas do your homework, but don't come here for gourmet.  What works: Some pretty good food  What to improve: Table turnover"}
{"text":"Fortunately the wait for us wasn't that long to be seated.  We entered the restaurant to greet the hostess...that's right...WE greeted the hostesses because they were too busy talking.  Hostess takes us to our table.    5 -7 minutes later, waiter shows up.  We take our orders...  Jalapeno Poppers  There House Hog Burger  Fries   15-20 mins later....   everything comes out at ONCE  Ummm...I'm in the restaurant biz too...  Appetizers comes out first  Since we are at this small table, only our Fries and Jalapeno poppers fit on the table.  So we had to grab the burger out of the waitresses hands and transfer onto our small plates.  Since we're trying to finish everything at once...  It was not great.  Jalapeno poppers got soggy since the poppers are displayed inside a shot glass with their cheese sauce.  Of course...it's cold by now after sitting there for over 5 mins.  so we couldn't enjoy that...  Our burger was cooked perfectly but it's cold.  The apple butter paired perfectly but again, I wish my food was HOT  The fries were SUPER salty and their dipping sauces did not pair well in my opinion with the fries.  We didn't see our server the rest of the night, so we couldn't ask him for either additional sauces for the fries and etc.  Oh well...I'll be going back to Cali for my Umami Burger....Good bye Vegas"}
{"text":"So I was pretty excited about Burgr. I'm a bit of a burger snob, kinda like you have to be when your 30th birthday is approaching way too fast, and you realize that your diet suddenly (and strangely) demands that you no longer eat any old burger.  So going to a burger joint is a big deal for me. And here are the initial thoughts on Burgr.  It's just ok. I know, I know, I wanted better too. When you walk in, there's this giant photo of Ole' Gordon hands in the air, exclamation on his face, and you're thinking \"I want to duplicate that after I eat my burger.\" But you can't, and you won't, unless you're one of those people under 30 who can eat any old burger any day, I'd say choose wisely and check out Burger Bar or Holsteins.  The appetizers were alright. The sauce on the poppers was fantastic, the poppers themselves were just meh. Likewise with the chicken wings, the wasabi was alright, it was the sweet one that had a nice flavor kick to it.  I got the Euro Burger and it was just too much on the goat cheese. I like goat cheese, but it was smothered in so much that the other flava flavs never had a chance to compete.  The real winners if you choose to go here are these: the beer list (fun) and the truffle oil parmesan fries which were some of the best french fries I can recall having in a long time. The service was nothing impressive but nothing horrible, and the Oreo creme brule milkshake was alright, but nothing compared to the great ALCOHOLIC shakes at Holsteins!   So if you're a Ramsy fan, check the place out. The burgers aren't bad, but for what you can get someplace else on the strip, they also aren't the go to burgers I was hoping for!"}
{"text":"I assumed since it had Gordan Ramsays name on it it would be delish.   For me it was just an OK $15 burger. I ordered the hells kitchen burger which I asked for medium, my burger was damn near still alive so I traded with the boyfriend cause I hate to complain. Besides the burger still being alive it lacked flavor it was really bland.  I was told the onion rings were \"amazing\" so I ordered them. They werent. The onion rings tasted like they were saturated in salt. Also I really think they need a water filter cause a glass of water tasted like it came from the toilet. Never drank toilet water but im sure its nasty.  But on a brighter note their milkshakes were delish. (That deserves a star alone.)  Now on to the service. For a high end burger joint I expected a little better. I mean it wasnt terrible, my only complaint is we sat at the bar and were not noticed by a server for almost 15 minutes. I just wanted a soda while I wated for my order to be taken. but what ever.  I did see some orders going out that looked yummy. I wont be going back there for their burgers but I do want to try their dogs and jalepeno poppers they looked so good sitting on the counter LOL so until next time. Peace out BurGR."}
{"text":"Yo!   Me and my gf had dinner here a few months back and I just remembered to write a review!   Anyhow food was awesome Service was good  Waiting in line kinda sucked   Other than that it's one of the best burgers I've ever had"}
{"text":"Delicious!! The truffle fries are a must and you really can't go wrong with any burger. One of the best burgers and fries I've ever had. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The farm Burger medium rare is totally the way to go. One of the best burger I have ever had except for a slight lack of salt. Gordon Ramsey has a thing against salt so I get it, but no salt in the meat and and no salt on the table."}
{"text":"Bucket list item checked.  Eat at a ramsay restaurant.   It didn't disappoint.  Amazing!!! Our server lauren was great and friendly.  Jalapeño poppers extra special and yummy.  Farm burger was so juicy, duck bacon amaze balls.  Parm fries were.good but was shocked with the sweet potato fries.  I dont even loke sweet potatoes  but the contrast with the jalapeño honey mayo,  mmmmm so delicious.   Again lauren you were great"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas is always a treat especially when it comes to the food! My husband and I visit Las Vegas every year and one of the main things we look forward to is \"Good Eats\". I must say we've experienced that at BurGR. This restaurant is an excellent addition to the Planet Hollywood Hotel. The atmosphere was delightful and our service was awesome. My husband and I both had the American Burger with fries.  We couldn't decide on which fries to get so we decided on the Truffle fries and the Original fries. The portion of fries you get are enormous. The burgers were amazing and cooked perfectly to our liking. You will leave very satisfied. The fries were amazing with the dipping sauces. I would recommend you visit this place while in Vegas! My only critique would be the lines can be pretty long to get a table. However, once you get that table you will forget about the wait!"}
{"text":"We went to Vegas for my daughters 21st birthday. This was where she wanted to eat. The wait was only about 10 minutes so the line goes fast. For 2 people at least. The only thing that bothered me during this wait was the little heater thing that you need to wait by. It was already in the 90's in Vegas, then the walk it took to get there. You are already overheating and then you have to stand next to this heater decor and it nearly kills you. But that is my only qualm. Thankfully we were not sat at the table near that thing. Had I not been looking forward to trying the farm burger for so long I would have had a hard time deciding. Every thing looked so good. But I knew I would regret not trying the farm burger so I went for it. It did not disappoint. My daughter on the other hand ordered the Hells kitchen burger. I am so glad I did not go that route. Now it was tasty and all. But after having oral radiation hot things do not go well with me anymore And it for sure had a heat factor to it. I took one bite. Was the hottest jalapeno I have ever tried. Got a good laugh with the waiter when I tried it and he was quick to get me some ice water.We also shared Gooey fries which were great. Could have been a little warmer in my opinion, but was good.  Our waiter was great. He even brought my daughter a birthday desert which she fully enjoyed. The prices were fine. It is a Ramsey establishment on the Vegas strip. You will pay for that. I would return. Great little place."}
{"text":"Very lively setting with a very attentive staff. The drink menu provided some very unique options which we enjoyed. The burgers we ordered, the  Hell's Kitchen and the European, were both perfectly cooked , medium and medium rare, which seems rare as most tend to overcook hamburger meat. We had a side of truffle fries that although good we wouldn't order again. They were a larger cut and in our taste a little \"soggy\" while we prefer a crisper fry. A little heavy on the Parmesan too. The one negative on the service is that the minute you put your fork down they were asking to clear the table, felt a little rushed like turning the table was the most important goal."}
{"text":"Just because the Chef whose name is on this restaurant is famous from Hell's Kitchen, don't expect anything great. Servers were rude and don't have a team approach to service. Onion rings and French fries were good, burger is not worth the inflated prices. My husband ordered a chili dog that came with no chili and was absolutely not good. When they say chili, they're referring to chile peppers, of which there were not many. Your own microwaved chili dog at home would be more impressive. Would not go back. Would have given them 1 star but the manager did do his best to make us be willing to give them another chance in the future. Not sure I would go back though since there are so many great options in Vegas."}
{"text":"Gordon I love you, I really do. But this place was awful! Let's start with the server. She was extremely rude, didn't explain anything when we asked and when I ordered something she snapped that it would not be enough food. So rude. That was about the last time we saw her all night because her twin sister was dining there and pretty much every second she was at that table talking to her instead of serving anyone. I am not exaggerating, she didn't come back to actually talk to us until giving us the bill. The only saving grace was the awesome bus girl who was very sweet and attentive.  The food. I was expecting so much for the price and because it's Gordon's place!  The chicken sliders: soooo dry! Really tough meat (which is odd for chicken) and zero flavor)  The french fries: way overcooked, cold and chewy  The classic burger: nothing special at all    To say I was disappointed was an understatement.  Maybe I need to hang out with my waitresses twin sister to actually get any service."}
{"text":"We were very pleasantly surprised. We thought it might be more high gloss advertising than actual good food and service. We went on a Sunday mid afternoon, so the wait was only about 10 mins to be seated and the food took about 15 mins after ordering. We split the Euro and the three cheese. Both were excellent. We both liked the euro the best. Both were cooked to a perfect medium. They were warm vs hot. We tried the sweet potato fries with the jalapeño honey and powdered sugar. We also tried the onion rings. Both sides were very good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The burger was very basic nothing special. I would not spend my money on this burger I recommend In N Out for the money and quality.  Ps. The onion rings are the best I ever had by far. They are crunchy and good. The service was great , quick easy and fast. But what I said, the burger is not worth the cost and wait..."}
{"text":"The burgers are delicious.  Tried the Gordon burger, which wasn't on the menu. The duck breast bacon is delicious."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out BurGr. It was everything I thought it would be. We waited in line for a bit but it was worth it. I had a simple cheeseburger and fries with a soda. It was delicious! The meat was well cooked and I loved the designer ketchups. The decor was fun and clean. The service was fantastic. Our food came out quick and our server was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We ordered hell's kitchen and earth (veggie) burgers, truffle fries and shake #4. The shake was out of the world! Truffle fries and hell's kitchen (with chicken patty) were really good but the earth burger was okay. I was disappointed to see no patty in the veggie burger. It just had two huge portabella mushrooms instead. It tasted okay though. Overall, not a great pick for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"I'm such a huge Gordon Ramsay fan--it's ridiculous. And after missing out on beef wellington during Dine LA, I knew I had to get my Gordon fix in while in Vegas.  The place was actually pretty hoppin'--so make a reservation if you can.  CHICKEN WINGS (4.5/5): Comes with two flavors: hot/spicy and wasabi. I personally preferred the more traditional hot/spicy, but that's because I love spicy food. Wasabi was interesting, but lacked a kick. Chicken was crispy and hot.  BURGER (4/5): I ordered the farm burger, medium rare, since I love runny eggs. The patty was moist and cooked perfectly. And the duck bacon was interesting--it was milder than regular bacon, and more chewy than crispy. The most disappointing component to me was the bun, which didn't add much texture or flavor (I guess I prefer more sandwich-like burgers, a la Father's Office).  FRIES (5/5): If you're gonna get fries, skip the regular and sweet potato, and go with the truffle fries. They're hot and thickly cut, so they just suck up all that truffle oil and parmesan. Just really delicious and satisfying. Comes with garlic aioli, and in a pretty generous portion/cone.  OVERALL: First time in a Gordon Ramsay joint, and flavor-wise, it didn't disappoint. Burger and truffle fries are a must here. Probably will try the hot dog, if there's a next time (THEY LOOK HUGE). But won't be angsty to go again anytime soon, with Earl of Sandwich right next door (drool)."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced in my opinion. Would def rsther hit up a 5 guys over this place. Burger was ok. Bun was buttery, which I think most people like. But not my personal preference. The fries were not good. Thick cut and over fried. Couldn't taste any potatoe. And they were $7! Def stay away from the regular fries. Overall pretty disappointed with the overall experience."}
{"text":"What can i say, gordon ramsay sets up great establishments.  First impression is of course WOW. No res so we walk up, just in town for a few hours so any seat will do... by the by the place was full. As we sat near the bar i noticed there was a bar where you can watch the chefs... f me for missing that. I asked the staff if there is a special request needed to sit there. they said no just ask... i did, but even with empty seats couldn't get the seat. it's okay.  menu is awesome, simple and fairly priced. if you aren't used to paying more then 10 bucks for a burger then this place isn't for you. the price matches the quality and care the chef take to make it. if i could work there i so so would. fries are great. sauces were awesome. the chipotle ketchup wasn't very heated as i wished it would be, but i know the cliental are mostly tourist so oh well. i get it, make sure your guest aren't overwhelmed. curry ketchup, awesome! ummm, food great. oh yeah many awesome beers on tap... on to the next  why no 5th star... staff. since this a review of overall, the staff let me down a little bit. the hostess, pretty awesome. our waitress you can tell was having a rough day, she had a look of concern and frustration the whole time. i get it, rough crowd when you have many coming in but take a min and get it together. smile. lucky for her the other staff that was just coming on for the switch was ready to go and very friendly. another thing... don't most managers have a office, one manager walkin the place and saying hey... good work. the other had much work to do and was busy at the bar but also running staff... ?? well, as i took a look around most people were okay, all but one table... most obvious too, they had that look like \"where the hell is my damn waiter!!!\" i called out to the manager working on with iPad, he asked what was up and i told him about the table... boom they got service. if i didn't i wonder how much longer they wouldve waited... so much wait staff kept passing them up. sad.  but, overall still gets my respect, i will be back, at the chef bar though. and maybe i'll bring my veg gf cause yes they do have a veg option. if you are in town and want to taste something gordon puts his name on then go in and try. maybe you'll love it too."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Gordon Ramsay BurGR since I wanted to see what the fuss was about after watching him on Hell's Kitchen.  I was definitely not disappointed!    We ordered: * five spice chicken sliders - it was mixed reviews - half of us liked it and half thought it was only okay.  The chicken was not dry and had a good crispy texture, but the five spice flavor was very strong   *honey-pig bao bun - delicious, delicious, DELICIOUS!  Not super sweet but all the condiments went together very well  *earth burger - I love meat patties, but this Portobello mushroom patty can really convert me!  it was so packed with flavor and was juicy to the bite.  I would definitely get this burger again!  * farm burger - the patty was cooked to what was ordered and the egg, duck bacon, everything worked well together  * truffle parmesan fries - a little salty, but the garlic, parmesan, and truffle work well together   *shake #5: chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake + praline cookie - this was my FAVORITE from a great meal.  It was everything I was hoping it would be - sweet, but yummy coffee flavor and complimented the meal.  We passed this around the table and everyone agreed it was a favorite.  * sticky toffee pudding push up pop - I was a little disappointed with this since I have been waiting to try the famous sticky toffee pudding Gordon Ramsay is known for, but if the little bit that was in this push-pop is what it tastes like, I think I can pass on it.  There wasn't any specific thing that was bad about this it just wasn't terrific.  After the shake, this was just a little of a let down.  Overall, I would definitely come back if I am ever wanting a good burger and great milk shake.  They don't take reservations, so be ready to wait.  There were five of us and we waited 45 minutes - this was on a Saturday night at 6PM"}
{"text":"Farm burger was sooo tasty egg medium over easy and medium for the meat. Milk shake #5 was really tasty and the hummus was good too. Ughh. #foodcoma"}
{"text":"THE GOOD: Burgers, fries and drinks were really good.  I loved the variety of burger selections and 3 types of french fries to choose from.  They also have specialty drinks that we really enjoyed.    THE BAD: We came for the first time and there were 5 of us in our party.  Bill came to $195 for burgers, fries and drinks. Yea.... I think the fries should come with the burger considering the price.  Most specialty drinks are $10-14 on average.  The waitress was VERY sweet, however, we waited FOREVER for our food.  There were MANY people working but we looked around the room and we saw many tables that were just sitting there and waiting... waiting.  They even had the manager (big dude in a suit) walking around serving people.  When we were finally done, we waited for roughly 23 minutes just to get our check and credit card back from the waitress.  Mind you, the original waitress we had was nice but then she went on a break.  Another person relieved her but we never saw that person the entire rest of the meal.  Considering the amount of people working, there is zero reason to wait so long just for a check.  Bogus.  Probably won't return for that fact alone, no matter how good the food was."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Chef Ramsey's restaurant and was exactly as expected... It was great! really packed but worth the wait. The meat was perfectly cooked and the servers were really nice and professional. My entrees were out but my appetizer didn't come out so they offered to take my entrees back and re cook them and bring them out after my appetizers had been served. Never had service like this. Only bad thing is the line is really long. The burgers look really small but its actually really filling. Don't get fooled"}
{"text":"Most packed restaurant for a late afternoon in the Planet Hollywood casino. There was even a small line forming and it was not even peak eating hours. I assume it's for the Gordon Ramsay name. The hosts were very friendly and helpful while taking my (takeout) order. Always with a smile, no attitude. Right away, they presented a welcoming  vibe.  However, I did feel that the food is overpriced for tiny portions and mediocre quality:   Fish sandwich with salt/vinegar crisps: Horrible bread to fish ratio. First off, I was expecting a sandwich, not a long roll. The roll was good, lightly buttered. The fish was breaded and battered nicely, but it was so thin and dwarfed by the roll that it was completely underwhelming. Also didn't have any ale taste. And the crisps?? OK, little sticks....for the price of this meal, couldn't include something a little heartier? Not expecting a full bundle of fries or anything, but even a few shaved salt/vinegar potato slices would have made a better impression than something that looked similar to thin shredded potatoes.   Ahi Poke sliders -- very fresh tuna! Enjoyed this very much, and two small sliders was perfect, because having much more would have messed with my stomach (too much raw food in one sitting makes me feel sick). This was a slightly refreshing bite, and I had a variety of sauces with it. My favorite was a green one, that seemed to be avocado based. 2 stars because of this.   Glad that I tried it once, for the novelty sake, but would most likely not come back. I can't imagine the burgers being particularly mind blowing, and I'm sure the portion would be too small for the price."}
{"text":"Ever since being a fan of Gordon's shows, I've developed an interesting way I critique restaurants. I've never cared about presentation, or colors, or small menus, or POS systems, or uniforms, but thanks to GR I do. I am a pretty harsh critic and generally treat people the way Gordon does. I'm told that I'm nasty and no fun to be around and just a totally jerk. Gordon does the same and is a millionaire, go figure.   Anyway, this place is pretty damn cool!  The entrance has a chic Burgr sign, surrounded by glass encased fire. A real spectacle. Normally I'd be embarrassed to get my large behind's photo taken in front of a burger joint, but everyone was doing it!  The line in front of the sign is long, and you can give them your number to text you when your table ready, a bit excessive to wait over an hour for a burger.   Got our text and showed up for our meal. Sat down, waiter hands you an iPad to look through drink specials and the like. I ordered a squatters double IPA on draft so I was happy. Some party members got a blood orange cocktail and a skinny girl lemonade. High priced, but that's Vegas!  Next we looked at our menus, why is Gordon's bust there engulfed in flames?  Why?  Pretty tacky, but the waiter said to keep them.  My girlfriend will like the souvenir, as opposed to the $25 tshirts they sell.  We ordered our meals. I started with Onion Rings as a \"snack.\"  Just call them appetizers. Anyway, they were heavenly. I've never imagined a better onion ring. Hand battered, fresh cut, and the addition of Parmesan cheese was an incredibly nice touch. The ketchup and other dipping sauces were made in house and great as well. I ordered the farm burger, medium, also. It came out perfectly cooked, beautiful presentation, and tasted wonderful. The rest of the party were delighted with their selections as well.  The only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because, come on, it's a burger joint, and it has over an hour wait and comes out to around $50 per person with fries and a drink. That's just too expensive, even for Vegas. Will I return?  Hell yes, because I am a sucker and the food was damn good!  Note: If someone is a member of total rewards, bring your card, if not sign up in Planet Hollywood first, it's $1 off each item per person, well worth it for 5 minutes to get a free card."}
{"text":"I would recommend not. Really anywhere but here. It wasn't completely awful but it was the worst meal that I had my entire week in Vegas. The atmosphere was pretty generic and the food was expensive for what it was. Service was slow. The poppers app was pretty good but it was served in sauce so it got soggy halfway through. We had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the truffle fries. Both were decidedly meh. Edible but that is about it. No distinctly flavor or texture. Fries were soft. Do your self a favor and go across the street for much better burgers and tiny bit cheaper prices."}
{"text":"Besides the long wait, my experience at BurGR was great.  We had the Farm Burger, the Hell's Kitchen Burger, truffle fries, and caramel shakes.  It was probably the most beautiful looking burger I've ever had.  The service was outstanding.  I would highly recommend coming here if you need a hamburger fix in Vegas."}
{"text":"The wait in line annoyed me for a burger joint GR or not however the customer service made me forget it . I ordered a basic american straight to the point and burger out. I probably should have been a lot more wild in my selection my onion rings never showed but my helpful server took them off my bill and apologized no biggie my fries were enough to share so I was happy to save some money.  On the real our server Matt was beyond exceptional and my Ice Tea was the best I have ever had.  Pretty cool tourist experience.  The flavor ketchups were the cherry on the sunday."}
{"text":"I expected much more from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant being that he is so highly critical of others and their methods. I like all of his shows and even started cooking at home after watching an entire season of Kitchen Nightmares on Netflix. That might have nothing to do with his restaurant, but when your main source of marketing is being a celebrity chef that verbally bashes bad food made by other establishments, you have to expect a certain level of service & quality in his product.   If it wasn't for the awesome glass wall of fire in the front of this restaurant, I'd give it 1 star.    I wen't to Vegas for memorial day week and 3 of my 6 reservations were at his restaurants (Burger @PH, Steak @Paris, & Pub@Ceasers).  Burger was the 1st of his spots on my trip. Even with a reservation we waited 15 minutes in line, which was the same wait time for those without a reservation. The promptness of service was good, but there was a breakdown in service at some point because the 4 of us weren't that pleased with the food.  1. My medium bacon burger was very well-done & bacon was somewhat bland. 2. My friends well-done burger arrived bloody, but he liked the fries. 3. The female of the group ordered a meatless mushroom burger w/ no complaints. 4. My other friend received the burger as ordered, but he said it wasn't that great.   After spending $140 for mediocre burgers, the group agreed not to waste our time with the other 2 Ramsey restaurants & I cancelled the open table reservations.  There are thousands of burger places to choose from  in Vegas, step it up!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! I had the farm burger and my husband had the southern yardbird burger, we shared the gooey fries. We recommend everything, the flavors were on point. Definitely recommend this place, it will not disappoint you!!!"}
{"text":"They had some unique hamburgers all $15-20 without any sides. Were they better than McDonald's or sonic of course much better! I wouldn't call them much better than most restaurants burgers though. Had a few unique combinations but terrible service. We waited forever to order and even longer to actually get our food. The only way to order fries is family style which is annoying if one of you wants sweet potato and one wants normal. You go for the famous name not the food."}
{"text":"Great food good menu they had vegetarian options I got a kale salad delicious price was reasonable prices especially for las vegas I will sure to dine here again also got a little coupon for staying at planet hollywood. If your looking for good food great prices and service stop here. Fyi it is all burgers its a burger"}
{"text":"Best burger ever! We tried 3 different kinds and loved each one. The onion rings are a must order as well. GR got it right on this one as his others. Don't skip this place."}
{"text":"WHHHY OH WHY DID YOU DISAPPOINT GORDON. Husband and I were so eager to try this place out after reading such great reviews. Love the ambiance and hip feel to this place. Unfortunately there was nothing about the food that left us wanting to come back for more. Our waiter made our experience slightly awkward because not once did he shine a smile to us. He meant serious business from the get go.   Jalapeño poppers. I must warn you, it's spicy as hell! Comes in a set of 6 with each popper pre-dunked in a cheese ranch sauce. I was expecting a crunchy outer shell with a soft and warm center with the cheese oozing out. No. Nothing close to it. The poppers already pre-dipped in individual sauces is a bad idea, Gordon. The sauce made them soggy and uneasy to eat. Would be much better if the sauce was on the side.   Beer batter onion rings. Nothing amazing about it. Tastes like onion rings I eat at the state fair. Meh.   Farm burger & American burger. Unfortunately both burgers are the upsets of our dining experience. I couldn't even tell you how the burger tastes because the salt was so, SO overpowering at first bite. I even informed our waiter of our burgers being way to salty and there was nothing that could be done other than a careless \"Oh really?\" response. My husband and I both took one bite of the burger and left. (refer to my photo) No replacements was even offered to us.   All in all, this was by far the worse burger and meal I've had. Definitely will not be dining here again or at any other GR restaurants. What a disappointment."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place!! 4 stars goes to location, service, pricing, and QUALITY of food!!  Gordon Ramsay is a famous chef throughout the world and I was happy to finally try one of his restaurants. BurGR is located in one of my favorite hotels (PH) and has a nice modern decor to it. The wait for me was about 20 mins, which I didn't think was too bad.  Service was amazing!! Polite, friendly, personable staff!! They refill water before asking and know their menu very well when I had asked questions about certain entrees.   Food was impeccable! 1. Jalapeño Poppers: BY FAR THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!! It was presented nicely, and the taste was explosive! I was hooked after one bite! It has a hit of spicy that makes it unique and makes you wanting more. And that special sauce it is dipped in makes it even better! Beware, a few of these and you'll be needing a refill of water sooner than you think! 2. Truffle Parmesan Fries: You can never go wrong with truffle parmesan fries! And the dipping sauces it came with made it even more amazing. The flavor of the crunchy freshly made fries with the aioli dipping sauce is addicting! 3. Hell's Kitchen Burger: I LOVE avocados and they were definitely not greedy when it came to my burger, and the tomatoes were so delicious in this burger. I ordered it medium and it melted in my mouth!! One bite and you'll be sure to fall in love with this burger guaranteed!!  Everything was reasonably priced and worth every penny!! I'll be back!! And if you haven't been to BurGR I highly suggest taking the time to try this amazing gourmet burger joint!"}
{"text":"First off, DUDE. Its Gordon Ramsay, would could go wrong?  -Hells Kitchen burger: Medium rare, Crispy, tender, juicy but... avocado kept sliding. Oh! and it was a little spicy which was great! -Chicken Sliders: Very good! Chicken was super moist and perfectly cooked (Still a little \"red\"), the breading on it was crispy! -Oreo milkshake: Oreo Vanilla goodness but with a top layer of custard that help motivate the milkshake to be better. -Onion rings: Dude, the batter was light and airy. The onions were nice and sweet but not thick so that they had a good batter to onion ratio. Parmesan is always a tasty sub for salt.  All of the portions were perfect for a normal dinner that could keep you going for 6 hours.  Service was the best! Our milk shake came out late so the tradition at a well serviced restaurant is to comp... plus it was Vegas so why not?! haha. *A mother and daughter that sat next to us at the bar wanted their almost complete burger to-go, the server dropped it and came back to them and told the story, so they had to wait 10minutes for a new burger to take home which was awesome! Cant remember if they got comp'd too.  Down side of this burger joint is... when waiting in line. The TV screen that shows the menu... its not touch screen! Other than that, its all good."}
{"text":"Dining paradise in Vegas! Besides buffet and fine dining, there are so many good restaurants on the strip.  I would say Gordon Ramsay burgr is one of them!  In order to avoid the line up, we went to there at 6ish.  Still have lined up when we arrived!  After 20 mins wait, we got seated.  Gordon Ramsay posters and TVs are at every corner.  The music and background was so loud! May be we're too old for that... so we only ordered 2 burgers, finished and left right the way!  Mushroom burger -  the mushrooms were so favorable and patty was cooked medium rare.  The meat still juicy inside and the bun was fresh! Hell's kitchen burger - avocado, oven roasted tomato and medium patty also cooked perfectly.   Both burgers were huge, we just barely able to finish it.  We need bigger stomach for fries and shakes next time!"}
{"text":"So normally I would not be so picky with a review, however I am obsessed with burgers - eating the best anywhere has to offer and also making them at home. It takes a lot to impress me. When I eat a gourmet burger  I have high expectations.  We tried the truffle fries, blue cheese burger and the jalapeno burger we split the burgers in half so we could share( I don't recall the exact names but these were the main toppings). The blue cheese burger was very nice, lots of blue cheese but I though the bun was disappointing. At $15  a burger I expect a much higher quality type of bread. Overall a delicious burger. The Jalapeno one, I was expecting a little spice - not at all spicy, not even an after kick, I didn't even finish it as it was just totally lacking in flavor.  Lastly we ordered the burgers medium well and they came out pink in the middle  and the service was not particularly fast - tons of servers , not that many diners but the kitchen was slow when we went. Everyone was really nice though and they were open late which we appreciated.  The TRUFFLE FRIES - AMAZEBALLS.   So overall, yes yummy food, but for someone who really considers themselves  a foodie with a burger obsession I felt that while food was good it was overall nothing to really brag about. Go check it out for yourself and order the truffle fries. I personally feel that Umami Burger is much better than this place."}
{"text":"OK so for Vegas this place is a deal. You get very good ambiance, it's open truly late and the line even when busy moved pretty darn quickly.   I want a year ago and I'm remiss in not reviewing them sooner. Gordon Ramsey you actually put your money where your mouth is and that is a big task as he is such a blowhard. Anyhow I digress. I first want to say the menu is so much like Richard Blais FLIP in Atlanta that I was kind of surprised. But now on to the good stuff.   The waitstaff was truly impressive for it being 11pm and busy as all get out. Little wait, checked on us a number of times and the digital menus on iPads were \"slick shoes\" guys!  I had a the Farm Burger with and the Mrs and I split the normal fries. I also had a  La Fin du Monde which was like $7.00. BTW the LFDM is so good if you haven't tried it yet you need to. One of the best beers there is .  So my share of the tab was around $25.00 which if I were not in Vegas would be a bit steep but in Vegas that's like a deal if you get a drink for that price.   The burger was fantastic. It was full sized and then some. But the star of the show were the fries and Curry Ketchup. Oh Curry Ketchup you inspired me to write this review some 15 months later. Oh I have tried to replicate the deliciousness that you were at home but to no avail. Gordon Ramsey your ketchup is sinful. I have never like ketchup much. It falls behind BBQ sauce and most other condiments in my book but Curry Ketchup you were just so good I feel weird even thinking about it.   Well that's that! Try out BuRGR if you are near Planet Hollywood. Its about the same price as the cheap stuff in the Belagio or Aria and it's On Point!"}
{"text":"Little bit of a wait but bar seats are usually open if you're in a rush. Delicious, perfectly done burger and all the app's look delicious too."}
{"text":"Greatest burger in the history of man! Drinks were phenomenal (we ordered then all) and service was outstanding! Try to get on the list atleast an hour prior to when u want to eat"}
{"text":"My bff and I came here because we were starving and wanted to get some good food. Not knowing anything about the restaurant we walked in and were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very relaxed and the decor was very nice. I ordered a Euro Burger and was not disappointed the truffle aioli was a little strong for my taste but over all the burger was good. My bff ordered a Hell's Kitchen Burger with bacon and she enjoyed it as well. This is a nice place to go to if you want a well prepared gourmet burger."}
{"text":"I've been here once before and ate at the bar again because the line was just too crowded for a table. I had a one of the burgers with regular fries and everything about the food was good including the presentation but not great. I don't mind spending money for good food but this place is a little overpriced. Service was fair to good but not excellent.  I know they can get away with it for now because of the location and name but just not really completely satisfied."}
{"text":"AMAZing.. Each of us (5) ordered a different burger and each was amazing, couldn't decide which was our favorite! Fries were great too with 2 different sauces. Highly recommend the whiskey lemonade drink!! :) best burger I have ever had"}
{"text":"Our waiter said the Gooey Fries were \"lifechanging\", they were! The ahi sliders were out of this world....can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"OK burger.  Nothing special to me.  over salted too.   But that is a subjective comment.  I'm usually ok with salt but this to me had way too much.  Truffle Parmesan fries were OK.  Definitely not one of the best burgers I have had,  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give BurGR 3.5 stars ... when are you going to add that option, Yelp?!  We've visited BurGR twice this summer -- once on each of two different trips (one business-ish, one with the entire family, including a couple of extra teenagers).   As I see it, this place fell victim to what I like to think of as the Restaurant Peter Principle -- you eat there more than once and it eventually topples under the weight of your expectations.  Usually places take more than two visits for this to happen, though.  On our first visit, we happened to notice the sign as we were walking down the Strip, and (having watched Master Chef) decided to give it a try.  I read a few reviews beforehand and was a little worried about the possible wait, but we were seated within ten or fifteen minutes (on a weekend) and our server was very attentive.  The manager stopped by to check on us and we were given an iPad survey to complete to give feedback on our experience.  (I wondered if this might be a response to concerns about poor service)  On that first visit, we had the Parmesan truffle fries to share, a Euro Burger, Brittania Burger and split the coconut/strawberry milkshake for dessert.  The food was ... well, as Gordon would say, \"stunning\".  My burger was cooked absolutely perfectly -- I'm picky about hamburgers and rarely get them in restaurants, because I usually end up disappointed with an overcooked, stiff little hockey puck no matter how nicely I beg the waitstaff to make it as rare as the law allows.   The fries were like crack (we asked for more aioli -- the ketchup is a little funky but the aioli is equally cracklike) and the milkshake ... well, normally I actively dislike milkshakes (too many years of Slimfast -- the fatty legacy!), but this was absolutely phenomenal, more like a great big desserty pudding parfait than those creepy chalky goopy things other people sell.  So, it was with high hopes that we went back about a week ago with the entire family (and some of the kids' friends ... ka-ching ... let me just go on record as saying this is not a good place for kids who don't clean their plates unless you have money to burn).  The wait for a table for seven was about an hour -- a little less than promised -- which seemed reasonable on a weekend evening, and we sat down with high hopes.  This time, service started slow and just got slower.  We were seated by someone who may have been a manager, but didn't have any other manager contact during our visit.  Although the restaurant was no busier the second time than the first -- and toward the end of our meal, as it got closer to closing time, the place really emptied out -- it was difficult getting a drink refill or the check, and the ambient noise was such that it was hard to talk across our big table, so we mostly sat around staring into the middle distance wishing we could get back to our Vegas evening.  Our food was also somehow not quite as good.  This time, we ordered two truffle fries, one regular fries and one sweet potato fries for the table; everyone got a burger (some of the ones our table tried included the Farm Burger, the All American, the Yardbird -- which is chicken -- and the Hell's Kitchen Burger) and three of the kids got different shakes (so I had the opportunity to taste almost the entire shake menu, because sneaking tastes of other people's food is one of the few mom privileges I can still claim).   The food took a bit longer to come out than I recall; the fries didn't come until after the burgers (last time, we got them a bit ahead of time so we could enjoy them before they started to get cold), and apparently my pleas for still-cold-in-the-middle fell on deaf ears this time, because my burger was definitely medium -- medium-medium, not even medium-rare.  Blech.  Hockey puck.  No amount of nice bun or interesting toppings can counteract that.  I didn't send it back, because (a) I'm not That Customer unless something is truly make-you-sick wrong with the food and (b) I figured we'd be in there another hour at the rate we were going, and everybody was antsy to leave.  I was hoping we'd get to take another one of those iPod surveys so I could let management know with a little more discretion, but this time they weren't offering that option.  Rage!!  If this place were always as good as the first time we went, I'd make it a point to stop there every time we're in Vegas.  If it were always like the second time, I wouldn't come back again, especially in a city with so many bazillions of other interesting food options at that price point.  Yes, the shakes are wonderful, but the fries are much less crack-like when they're cold, and the burgers are less awesome when they aren't cooked the way you ask them to (which, for $13-15, you ought to expect; if I wanted a hockey puck I could go to Chili's, God forbid).  To use a Master Chef metaphor, this place definitely ended up in the elimination round despite winning the Mystery Box challenge."}
{"text":"Since it was Vegas, I knew there would be a wait, which was fine. Besides, I only waited for a few minutes. Sat down at the bar, and received a warm welcome by them. I asked for suggestions and they really good about asking what I liked in a burger. I went with their European Burger, that had goat cheese and other strong tasty cheeses and it was GREAT. Small but mighty burger. Also ordered some fries to share and it was worth it.  The meal was not big in quantity, but it made it up for the quality. I will be back to try different burgers in the future."}
{"text":"We went to Gordon Ramsay BURGR at Planet Hollywood for Lunch.  It was really good, but didn't really compare in any way to Gordon Ramsay Steak.  It is funny how much he yells at contestants on his TV shows about their food being bland.  And I was surprised about how bland both of our Burgers were.  It was good, but fairly expensive and not great.  The best part of the meal by far were the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Pops for Dessert.  If I were to go back I think I would just get a Shake and Dessert. Gordon Ramsay Steak is amazing in comparison!!!  Don't think if you didn't like BURGR that they can be compared in any way.  Because they are nothing alike and have nothing to do with each other!  They really need to add a good rub or seasoning to their Burgers.  Maybe some Sauces or something.  Just really dry and boring.  I haven't tried Bobby Flay's new Burger restaurant yet, but I have a feeling his is a lot better.  Gordon is my favorite on TV, but he needs to come over to my place and I will grill him a Hamburger.  I think we have found one thing that Brits and Gordon can't cook, and that is a good American Burger!"}
{"text":"A burger is a burger is a  burger, and I'll always be hard pressed to believe that any burger joint can offer a \"fine dining\" experience. Gordon Ramsay BurGR understands this, and while a meal there is not \"fine dining\", it is most definitely \"fun dining\".  I've visited twice already. Once to sample the burgers and then a second time, because the crazy list of appetizers and sweet treats on the menu caught my eye and lulled me to come back sooner than later. Both visits were a hit.  The menu  is clean and simple and offers eight burgers and three \"dawgs\" as mains. There are also three burgers that come \"stacked\" with a meat patty and a meaty extra like shaved prosciutto or duck bacon.   I had the delicious Char Siu Burger served with a beef patty and a slice of roasted pork belly, cucumber, radish, cilantro and a honey-hoisin sauce. The Asian-inspired extras were a nice touch, but the star was the medium rare beef patty that was succulent and juicy, and one of the best burgers I have had on the strip.  The missus ordered the Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg that was smothered with roasted fresno peppers, jalapenos, and a touch of chipotle ketchup. This was also a smash and was so much better than the hot dogs served next door at Pinks.  On our second trip in almost as many days we tackled the \"snacks\" section of the menu and tried three of the six appetizers.   The Fury Chicken Wings play off the Hell's Kitchen theme that is somewhat overly branded here, with flame decals popping up everywhere. The wings are served eight to a plate -- four tangy hot Buffalo style wings that again proved to be superior to most pub wings I have had, and four honey wasabi wings that provided a different flavor profile and fondly reminded me of the Shanghai Wings once served at a now defunct restaurant in Montreal that was my go-to spot for wings and things.  We also indulged in the four Five Spice Chicken Sliders that were breaded with Cornflakes and were kind of like yummy mini schnitzels in a bun. And while the spices and siracha mayo gave them some kick, I felt they did not need the cheddar cheese melted underneath. That said, I would love to see a BIGGER version of this burger added to the mains.  The Honey-Pig Bao Buns were just OK, and this was really the only miss on our second evening simply because we have had better elsewhere. While I liked the addition of pork belly on my burger, it was a bit too much of a good thing and slightly tough on its own, but that did not stop us from finishing it.  The menu also features two specialty fries that we tried on different nights. I preferred the Truffle Parmesan Fries that were crunchy and doused with liberal amounts of shredded parmesan, while the missus liked the Sweet Potato Fries that included a honey jalapeno mayo and vanilla powdered sugar as a condiment. This will definitely be a problem on a future visit as each portion is more than enough for two, so I hope they add a sampler of some kind to the menu that lets guests indulge in both styles.  Speaking of two people, I have to give props to the our two servers (both named Alex) who made some wonderful suggestions after listening to our tastes, and made us feel so incredibly welcome. We cut past the 30-minute wait on both nights by opting to sit at the back counter that offers an open view of the kitchen, and is where both Alexi (my pluralization of Alex) can be found dashing back and forth as they place orders and pick up plates. Yet not matter how busy they were in that very controlled kitchen chaos, they always popped past us to chat for a couple of seconds, check up with us, and almost made it feel like were were attending a very busy dinner party at a friend's place. What's more, while Alex 2 was our principle server on our second night, Alex 1 acknowledged our return visit and engaged us in conversation while Alex 2 was away working the front of the house.   They also introduced us to Benji, BurGR's evil genius of all things beer, who made some great suggestions and introduced us to the wonderful apricot flavors of Magic Hat #9 after carefully consider of our tastes in ales and Belgian beers.         I also managed to down one of the five \"sugar fix\" shakes with my appetizers. I opted for Shake #5 following Alex 2's suggestion that its Nutella like composition of chocolate hazelnut pudding and some coffee ice cream had to be tasted to be believed. Oh so decadent! I believe!  Nothing completes a meal like a great dessert and the über fun Sticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops, served to us with a smattering of Alex 2's nostalgic impersonation of Bill Cosby shilling for Jell-O and arguing with wife Camille, were simply to die for.   We took these babies to go and I felt like I was in Lord of the Rings. These pops mesmerized all those who saw them. \"That looks so so good,\" strangers said hoping to covet them, but there was NO WAY we were going to share this pretty precious delicious dessert. MY precious pudding push up pops!"}
{"text":"Been here 2x now the first with the wife and second with friends we traveled to vegas with. Each time we had different burgers and the different variety of fries. The food was spectacular as was the service. I've enjoyed Gordon's tv shows over the years but after eating here it's obvious he's the real deal. Foods pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"I did my research of what to eat during my visit in Las Vegas, I landed here. Being a fan of his shows, we want to dine here. We ordered three burgers, Parmesan fries and sweet potato fries. First of all, it's really hard to mess up a burger, I thought the burgers were decent but nothing wow'ing me.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which supposed to have jalapeños and a few other peppers. It barely did anything for my taste buds. I didn't taste any jalapeños. The Parmesan fries were not that great, it was $11 and didn't live up to that price. On the other hand, their sweet potato fries were delicious.  Pricey food as expected, I'm a sucker for these sort of things but I probably would go elsewhere for burgers since the burgers really didn't have any flavor and I probably can get it for half the price elsewhere. Good to try once."}
{"text":"Had another great experience! My wife and I both ordered the Euro Burger! It was tremendous. Best burger we have ever eaten. We sat at the kitchen counter. Great choice. The head chef Harold was extremely personable. We told him what an amazing job he was doing at the conclusion of our meal and he said he had a great team. A true leader! We will 100% be return customers."}
{"text":"After a day in Vegas, we were starving... a burger sounded good. The wait was insanely long, with visible open tables. The atmosphere was nice, but very crowded. The table next to us, was literally, next to us. The service was slow...slow...slow... I am not entirely sure why so slow either. A burger was ordered in addition to the chicken sandwich, sweet potato fries, and a milkshake. The food was good - not the best and not the worse, prices were \"Vegas\" prices. I am not sure that I would wait in the line that I did for that food though."}
{"text":"I loved it. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger.  It was spicy but it was a good mix with the avocado  !!! I loved the fries also . Would come back again"}
{"text":"You can find better burgers at any of the surrounding places without waiting in line for 30min and another 30min to get your burger, Overall waste of time and very disappointing"}
{"text":"This is a tale of two reviews. When we visited this restaurant in Sept, 2014 the experience, service and food were amazing. We visited again on Nov 11 2015 and the food and service have definitely declined- fries and burgers were sub par and SLOW SLOW SLOW SLOW!! Beer was cold and bubbly at least but we will most likely not return."}
{"text":"The food is really good, the service needs a ton of work.  Gordon should bring a crew his TV show that turns around restaurants here to give them some tips.  My dining companions and I shared onion rings, a cheeseburger and a hot dog.  The Hells Kitchen burger was tasty and packed a bit of heat from the peppers. A solid burger that I would order again.  The dog was so huge that it was borderline obscene, also very tasty and packed some heat.  The rings and fries were perfectly good, nothing spectacular.  The service was slllloooooowwwww.  We waited 40 minutes after ordering for the food to arrive.  I am sure the kitchen is slammed and working out the kinks since they've only been open a week but the servers made it worse with comments such as:   \"Wow, your food hasn't arrived yet, that's totally sucks!  But I promise it will be worth the wait, save room for dessert\"  The comment may have been cute and peppy 1 time but it was gratingly annoying the fifth time.  I'll come back after the kinks have been worked out of the operation.  The burgers are really, really good..."}
{"text":"30 minute wait to get a burger and fries. Yes, the fries were cold. I did not send back because i didnt have time to wait for another order. Not worth the wait at all"}
{"text":"I'm ruined forever!!! The Euro Burger was amazing. Paired it with the truffle Parmesan fries."}
{"text":"So as a huge Gordon Ramsey fan, I was very excited to eat at this place.  The staff was very nice even with their skin tight skimpy clothes (both guys and girls).  But it's Vegas right?   So at the recommendation of the waitress, I ordered the Hells Kitchen Burger.  She said it was one of the most popular and it was \"spicy\" all the way through.  I also ordered the regular fries.  So I was so excited to try this burger since the lady next to me ordered the Fish & Chips Sandwich and it looked glorious. So this lady ate her whole sandwich, paid, and left before I even got my burger.  When it finally came out, it just looked sad sad sad.  No garnish or anything.  Just a small mediocre-looking burger on a plain plate.  I opened the burger and there was one sautéed piece of what I think was a red pepper as well one small piece of avocado.  I was very underwhelmed. I've seen better looking burgers at Red Robin and Chillis, which doesn't say much. So I have to say the burger tasted good at least even though I didn't get ANY of the \"spice\" I was promised. I pretty much finished it in several bites.  I even had my camera ready to take a pic of what I thought was going to be a masterpiece on a plate and share it with all my Facebook friends, but I changed my mind once I was almost embarrassed by this plain looking teenie burger. However the regular fries were very good and the two sauces we sublime.  Overall I expected a lot more from my favorite celebrity chef."}
{"text":"I think this was one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Totally worth the hype, but it is kind of pricey for a burger.  Only bummer was the wait to get in (even late at night) and it takes a while to get your food.  Service kind of sucked also/was nonexistent."}
{"text":"just posted a review for GR Pub which I had previously praised highly but now seems to be in terminal decline.........now reviewing Burgr which I restricted to 3 stars before but now easily earns a 5 star review...strange but true !!! Visited on Thursday evening for dinner and greeters were pleasant, chatty and efficient. waiter was professional and friendly...both ordered burgers that were prepared exactly to our specification and were delicious. Atmosphere ideal for casual dining and both the waiter and the manager took time to check we were happy with everything. Drank soda, which were instantly refilled when empty and all in all this was a 100% enjoyable dining experience Can only suggest the staff at GR Pub are trained by whoever is training the people at Burgr...the 2 restaurants are like night and day and we will return to Burgr on our next trip to Vegas Oh and did I mention our bill was exactly 40% cheaper at Burgr than the Pub and Grill........very hard to understand as a customer"}
{"text":"Food was really good. My wife and I shared Southern Yard Bird burger which was awesome. We shared Truffle fries and Jalapeño poppers which are served in a shot glass of dipping sauce, loved them both. Service was so bad after we sat down, during service and trying to get the bill. The waiter and waitress were obviously LV Public School dropouts."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in the Las Vegas area so far. Have tried Bobby flays burger palace and Mario batalis B&B, Burger Bar and it doesn't compared to Gordon Ramsey's Burgr. Burgers are cooked to perfection with high quality ingredients. Onion rings and chicken wings are also amazing. Service was top notch. Will need to try Guy Fieri's restaurant next time Im in Vegas."}
{"text":"I remember going there 2 years ago on my lunch hour and it only took 20 min for food to arrive all fresh. I decided to go there for a Familly dinner this year. Not only they made us wait 45 min for my food witch arrived cold. Both burger patties where not even hot but worm. It tasted like Burger King whopper that was microwaved for 20 sec. I don't recommend this place to anyone since service took forever and the quality was not consistent."}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing just a little under cooked for me. Fries seemed like they were left under a warming light to long. Definitely  will give them another  shot. Wait staff was excellent."}
{"text":"After loving Gordon Ramsay for so long, we had to go check out burGR when we visited Vegas!   The restaurant is inside Planet Hollywood right next to the casino, pretty easy to find, just follow the signs. We came around 11ish and the wait was around 20-25 mins so it wasn't that bad.   Service was pretty good, except our server... We ordered a coffee shake and he brought out a chocolate shake instead. When we notified him of the error instead of bringing back the chocolate shake and giving us the right coffee shake, he wanted to charge us for an additional coffee shake for his mistake. Honestly, it was pretty disappointing for that to have happened at such a top notch restaurant. Kind of a downer at the end of our meal.   Anyways onto the food!! We ordered an appetizer of the jalapeno poppers, overall it was delicious ! The sauce was yummy and the popper was crispy and flavorful. It is definitely SPICY - if you can't handle the heat you might want to try a different appetizer! Then we got the truffle fries with the garlic aioli and that was so yummy. The sauce is delicious and fries are always good with burgers :P I tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was delicious, all the ingredients were fresh and the bun was toasted perfectly. The burger was definitely bigger than I thought it was going to be, based on the pictures they looked really small but it definitely fills you up. This burger also had a kick in it since it has jalapenos in it, so if you don't like spicy, this probably isn't the burger for you. My sister tried the Britannia burger which had a mango chutney, and she loved it. If you like the combination of sweet and savory I would definitely recommend the Britannia burger.   Overall it was such a good restaurant, I couldn't give it any less than 5 stars despite our terrible server. The shake mix-up was definitely disappointing and annoying, but the food was too yummy. Try and check burGR out when you're in Vegas !!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to go here ever since he mentioned it on MASTER CHEF. And where do I begin?! Let's start with the Wait.- it wasn't too bad. For 7pm, on a holiday weekend, and Planet Hollywood hosting a concert (JLo), the wait was only 30 min. The only thing, it was awkward waiting in a line outside the restaurant like a ride at a theme park.  The seating. - for expedited seating (because, otherwise, it could have been another 20 minutes) they seated us at the counter that watches the kitchen. Like a diner. I recommend it. Everything that comes out of the kitchen is mouth-watering!  Watching the expediter (\"my name is Chef!\"), Harold, was like watching the Cpt of a ship, a smoothly operated crew and him at the helm.  The food  - I can only comment on what we ordered, but I'll add that everything that came out of the kitchen looked incredible. I had some tastebud envy, for sure! So, my friend ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger med-well and I ordered the Euro Burger medium. Cooked to perfection and heavenly to devour! Yes, devour!!! Ordered the onion rings to start and even the ketchup was spectacular! My friend ordered regular fries. They were meh. We returned them because they couldn't even keep up with the rest of the meal and actually brought it down a bit. No hassle with our check, as they took off the item. That was a bonus.  Overall, go here!!! You won't be disappointed in the food. You may even gush over how amazing your burger is like I did.  The price is rather reasonable considering you're in Vegas. The service is ok. Lots of male eye-candy servers. A change from the boobalicious servers in every other joint. It doesn't seem like there's a server designated to a section. They all work the whole dining area. Makes tipping weird.  Regrets?! - I wish I had saved room for a shake. They looked phenomenal.  Why 4 stars? There was an incident where a server girl, one that rolls the napkins & silverware was pissed at a male employee. She threw something at him and yelled some foul language at him. Breakup maybe? Drama, for sure. She stayed at her napkin rolling station with a sour-puss face and it dampened the mood."}
{"text":"Amazing Burgers, better than Bobby Flay's. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place was amazing  Pretty extensive beer list and some decent wines as well. My friend and both had the chicken burger and truffled fries. SO good!  The wait looked like it was going to be long but wasn't - the restaurant is bigger than it looks from the outside. Service was excellent for the volume at the time. Will definitely go back next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was good I have to say but, is it worth the wait??  Food wise: I went with the tandoori chicken burger. The taste was above and beyond anything I've had. Great flavor but...  Service wise: we waited a while to be seated then we waited an HR and a half before we could get our food. Is great food a worth 2 hrs out of your day in Vegas?   Ambience wise: its a dinner feel in a Vegas casino  Price wise: standard Vegas prices apply   Overall, I don't see myself spending 2 hrs at a food spot in Vegas unless I'm in a buffet and trying to get my money's worth.."}
{"text":"I opened the menu on the iPad and it started screaming at me! It was very offensive, kept telling me I couldn't eat!  no no, I kid I kid...  I have always avoided celebrity chef restaurants as most of my experiences with them have been extremely underwhelming... so when I got taken here my expectations were low (except for my expectations of the bill!)  I was pleasantly surprised... the drink menu was foreign but we tried several drinks that were very dangerous (could not imminently taste the alcohol) but delicious!  burgers were excellent as was pretty much everything else we had  also Gordon Ramsay may have made a career out of screaming at people, but the man can sure pick a waitress uniform! cheers!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good but its not the best burger i have had in Vegas. The jalepeno poppers were delicious! We had the Hell's Kitchen burger, Euro burger and truffle fries. The truffle fries seemed to be plain with just a little shaved parm on top but the white dip that came with it was so good i was putting it on my burger. Overall experience I dont think you would be missing out on to much if you skipped this spot and you would save $60"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this 4 stars because our appetizer came after the burgers showed up, which just irritates me.  However, the food was so good it would be five stars without that service issue.  We had some chicken wings which were delicious.  Not too spicy, very meaty and crispy on the outside.  The burgers came out a perfect medium.  I had the farm burger and the egg on top was perfectly cooked.  I'm a sucker for a perfect egg.  My husband had the mushroom burger and he loved it.  We shared some truffle fries, which were awesome.  The dipping sauces that accompanied them were both really good with the fries.  The one thing about the fries is they are super rich, just a few are plenty, definitely shareable.  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was great! The food and service was amazing. We were on a 3 day stay at Planet Hollywood and luckily we tried this place on our first night. It was so good that we decided to go once more on our last day in Vegas. The sweet potato fries are the best I have ever had. Looking forward to going back on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE Gordon Ramsay fan. As a viewer of his many TV shows (MasterChef, Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, Hotel Hell [..did that one get cancelled?!] The F Word), I've come to admire his creativity, perfectionism, and work ethic. Granted, I arrived at Burgr NOT expecting Mr. Ramsay to be serving me a burger himself, but I was very much hopeful that his ideals would translate to his staff there. AND BOY THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT!  Though I'm a big GR fan, I'm an even bigger fan of burgers.. all things protein and sandwiches, really. I've had my fair share of burgers and I have to proclaim The Farm Burger at Gordon Ramsay Burgr as the BEST burger I've ever had.. hands down.   Farm Burger: beef patty (I ordered mine Medium), English sharp cheddar, duck breast bacon, poached egg, brioche bun.   What was so magnificent about this burger was that each element in it was a knockout; you could pick apart the egg, bacon, etc. to eat individually and be delighted, or eat them all together and still grasp the flavor of each topping in every bite. The patty was cooked to perfection: juicy, not over/under-cooked, tons of flavor that you could eat it alone sans toppings. The bun was toasted just right. No one flavor was bland or overpowering. Also, the burger wasn't stuffed with TOO many toppings where it became this unconquerable mountain.   Another item to try (if you have room) is their pork belly buns (bao). Happy servings of fatty pork belly with shaved carrots in a fluffy bao.   Best part of Gordon Ramsay Burgr? It was under $15! Not shabby at all for a gourmet burger. Given that prices are all inflated on the Strip, you could've gone to McDonald's or Panda Express and almost paid the same amount for crappy food.   In conclusion: EAT HERE. Especially before a night out of clubbing/drinking. Your body will thank you!"}
{"text":"Even with all the flames glowing around the dining tables, my burger on this visit came out lukewarm.  The fries were even less warm; I had to send them back.  I hope this was just an anomaly. Maybe GR needs to visit more often."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place from a couple of friends I decided to go for it. The wait is a bit long, but you're in a casino so there are plenty of things to keep you occupied.   First off, they have an excellent beer selection & the service is wonderful. Our waitress was really enthusiastic and knowledgable about beer. She gave us recommendations & even offered us samples. For such a busy restaurant I did not feel rushed at all.  - THE FRIES. The truffle parmesan fries are a MUST. It comes with two sauces, a bbq type sauce & an aioli. The aioli was delish. It complemented the fries very well.   - THE BURGER. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger, which came with asadero cheese, jalapeños, avocados, and a roasted tomato. I've never had asadero cheese before.  I'm not even sure what it is, but it was really good. The meat itself was good quality and cooked perfectly! Overall, really good burger!"}
{"text":"This was one of the only places I wanted to try during my stay in Las Vegas. As it turns out it was the worst of all eating establishments frequented during my stay.  To start we waited in line for approximately 30+min, which is not bad for most restaurants during the dinner hour, but for a burger joint? Ummm, we'll get back to that. We get seated and it's a good 15min before the manager who introduces herself as Nikki comes to our table to apologize and let us know our server was busy. That was nice. After taking our drink orders she said our server will be by shortly. Yeah it was another 10min wait. When our server finally makes it over to us she asks \"have you had a chance to look over the menu\"? I fought every urge to be sarcastic and replied \"yes we have\". She takes our orders with barely any description, recommendation, or talking really then leaves. She didn't introduce herself either. My friend attempted to defend her by saying maybe she's new? But I'm like she shouldn't be flying solo at this rush hour and even so she should talk more.  Meal: Our food comes out in decent time and it was pretty good. I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and despite the servers assurance that it wasn't too hot there was a kick that many customers might not find acceptable. The burger was cooked perfectly. I asked for medium rare knowing it would sit long enough to be medium by the time it reached our table lol. From the time our server left until the end of the meal she checked up on us twice. And one of those 2 occasions doesn't count because we flagged down bus person who notified our server.  The food was good, but not good enough to make up for the crappy service and 30+min wait.  Dessert: this was the 2nd time our server checked up on us, and this time it may not be totally her fault as far as ordering goes. It was awkward at first because she comes to the tabke, smiles, and... nothing. My friend and i didnt know what to do, didnt know if we should talk first or wait for her to say something...really awkward. Anyway that aside, BurGR uses iPads for their menu, and she showed us how to use it. The concept is cool but lacks server/customer interaction. She gets a pass on this one. I ordered the Chocolate Milkshake (topped with caramel pudding). I have to say that was one of the best milkshakes I've had in a long time.  Variables: during our time there we had good interaction with our bus person, who we saw frequently. There was also another expo/manager who was very pretty that kept me distracted throughout the evening from ranting about our server (hey, I had to find something good about this place, don't judge me lol). Had it not been for the above mentioned the entire experience would have been horrible. Seriously the 3rd star in this review is expressly for the attractive expo/manager.  I'd like to give BurGR another shot, but luckily for me I live in Hawaii and won't be able to visit them again for a while."}
{"text":"The Britannia Burger might be the best burger I've ever had. English sharp cheddar, mango chutney, and arugula make up this beautiful piece of work. I loved the sweetness of the chutney in there; an ingredient I wouldn't think to put in a burger. Well done, Ramsay! Oh, the truffle fries were also amazing.  The restaurant itself is pretty Gordon-tastic, i.e. over-the-top with his face plastered everywhere. There's a giant flaming fire fixture at the entrance, a big picture of his silly face in the middle of the restaurant AND on the menu. A little ridiculous, but pretty amusing as a shameless fan of his outrageous TV shows.   Prepare to wait at least 30-60 minutes for a table. If you're a party of 2, you can wait in line which goes fairly quickly. If you have 3+ in your party you have to leave your name down and wait for them to call you (no waiting in line). Singles can sit at the bar.   I was in a party of 3 and we ended up sitting at the bar to avoid the wait. The seats were awkwardly far apart, but then again it wasn't built for big parties. Bartender/servers seemed nice enough.   All in all it's worth the wait. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I'm conflicted writing this review because I really wanted to love BurGR more than I do.   There was a wait to be seated but that's to be expected at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  Service was average but friendly. Suggestions were provided when I asked and the meal was served in a timely manner considering what was ordered and how busy the restaurant was. The ingredients for my Blue Burger were all top quality and the meat cooked exactly as requested. The fries were just  average but most of the individual fries were very small in size (as if they were the leftovers from the bottom of the fryer basket).  The fancy cone they were served in was not even full (compared to what was delivered to surrounding tables).  Perhaps it's that the serving size (the burger) was so much smaller than what you can get in the same price range at other full service restaurants...or that I was expecting something about the meal to be more over the top.   I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsay...I can hear him now calling me a stupid donkey for not loving his restaurant! I'll keep watching his shows but don't think I'll return to BurGR next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries were delicious and the wait time was acceptable. I would give 4-5 stars for the food, however, the experience was ruined by the waitress. She did not greet or introduce herself to us. She appeared to be cold and unfriendly. When I got the check I asked her how the reward card worked, but she did not answer my question.  She literally seemed like she hated her job and was taking it out on us. I would definitely visit again but would make sure I get a different waitress"}
{"text":"Really good burger. In buffet heaven, 35 dollars for burger/appetizer/drink can be a tough sell. I tried it, and it was better than average but you can get better value at some other places around town.  The decor was really nice. The burger itself was very tasty. The jalapeño poppers were good, but a tad expensive I would say considering there are burgers for about the same price. The place is jammed packed, so they certainly are not missing out on any business, they have a prime location."}
{"text":"The burgers are definitely awesome.  There is always a line and you can skip the line and eat at the bar.  You get the same great food plus personalized service from the bar staff.  I tried the creme brulee milkshake and onion rings in addition to the burger. Both were excellent.  Reasonably priced for what you are getting."}
{"text":"I'm always a bit wary about places with a lot of hype, but this place most definitely deserves the hype. After a 34 mile backpacking trip, my boyfriend and I got into Vegas late and we were absolutely starving. We got to BurGR around 10 p.m., and there was a little line outside. However, one of the hostesses asked if anyone wouldn't mind sitting at the counter, and we immediately took them up on that so we could stuff our faces even faster. I would like to say, that sitting there was actually a very enjoyable and entertaining experience in itself. Even though it's not as intimate (but come on, you're here eating burgers), it was refreshing to actually see how the kitchen runs and how the staff interacts with each other. It may be a completely unfair comparison, but after watching all of the Gordon Ramsay shows, I can actually see that his kitchens are truly run like a well oiled machine. I saw that when one person was overwhelmed another person would step in, even if it was not exactly part of their usual tasks. They worked so fluidly and I actually saw my food being produced in front of me, which was something I can't say I've experienced before.  Now on to my magical burger. I ordered the Hog Burger, which was mangalitsa pork, English sharp cheddar, and arugula. This burger was absolute amazingness. From the very first bite to the last, I was savoring that thing so much I could SEE myself eating that in slow motion. Paired with the truffle fries, that was absolute heaven. I do have to put a disclaimer out there, though. My boyfriend ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and that burger is not playing around. There is a jalapeno in there that just burns you! My boyfriend got in a good two bites before he realized how spicy that thing was, and he ended up chugging his water, my water, and then two refills of our waters. After he took out the jalapeno he enjoyed the burger a bit more, but buyer beware, this burger is only for those spicy lovers.  If you're in Vegas, you must at least give this place a shot. An how often can you go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and pay less then $25 for a meal?"}
{"text":"I went here after EDC. I would come back again.  The wait was not as bad, but still we had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated. In my opinion, the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant was amazing.  This place had superior customer service. Friendly and knowledgable staff attended to all my needs.   I had the hog burger - it was not that good. Even though the waiter reccomended it as the #1 burger, I did not like it. However, it had an unique taste ~ one that i've never had before. It tastes close to sweet tangy spinach dipped in orange.  Then we had the chili dog. DELICIOUS. At 13 dollars, this was one of the best dogs I've bad.   We finished with truffle fries, and they were great as well.  For the atmosphere and food, 4 stars. Never getting that burger again though."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing !!!! I've been here two separate times and each time the food was beyond exceptional. My husband fell in love with all the burgers he's tried so far and the appetizers are sooooo good it really is hard to share especially if you have a favorite.   There is almost always a wait but trust me, the food is definitely worth the wait. The price range of this restaurant it also a major plus. I would honestly pay double or even triple what they charge for the meals they serve here. The quality of their food is exceptional and extremely under priced. If you do decide to come here make sure to try their Jalapeño poppers, chicken sliders, and their chicken burger. The poppers will totally put your mouth on fire but it will totally be worth it.  This restaurant it one of the main reasons I love coming to Vegas !!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants!!  Burgr is known for it's burgers! SO YUM!!!  The items I would order are the farm burger, the hog burger, the truffle fries, and the toffee push up dessert (because it's so unique)!  There's many things that make a good burger-- the non-soggy, can hold it's own bun, the quality ingredients, the interesting sauces.  Everything here hits a mark!  Definitely would recommend this place for burgers and their truffle aioli for the fries is AMAZING too!   Came here with a huge group of over 25+ people and we ended up splitting into 2 separate tables but it was still a great experience."}
{"text":"The ALL TIME BEST BURGER ive ever had, i will make this a necessary stop everytime I hit up Vegas"}
{"text":"Been busy so this is a late review.  First and foremost, service here is 4.5 star! Very attentive for such a busy place on Thursday. Now...honestly....I don't know how this place is such a big hit. Yes, Gordon Ramsey is a popular chef but the food here is less than par...way less...we order two burgers, $21 and $18 each, and the taste was very bland and dry. The \"so-called\" goey fries at $13 was a joke....the waitress did take the fries off the bill. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"We have when past this location a few times and there was always a line. Especially with the name of Gordon Ramsay and being impressed with his Pub location in Casaers, we decided to check this place out.   At 3pm, there was a decent line outside the location. I thought it was kinda odd since we eat early to avoid the lines but maybe that is a good sign. Finally, we made our way to the front and the location was not filled to capacity. Why we waited, I have no idea but will learn why later as dinner progressed.   Our server was very friendly so that is a huge positive. She took the time to explain a few things and was very bubbly. There was probably the only biggest positive there.   My girlfriend ordered a cocktail and I ordered a creme brulee milkshake. They both were amazing. And we ordered the duck poutine. The fries took about 20 minutes and they were fairly good. It came with duck bacon, the sauce had good flavor and depth. But the fries had a little grittiness to it. I dont think they washed the potatoes because it was almost like a small grains of sand. Very disappointed in that. As someone who once worked in fine dining... how could you miss an important step like that?  After an hour upon sitting down, our burgers did not arrive. We were finished with the fries (which I hoped would be enjoyed with the burger but as I slowly ate it... it was finished a long time ago) and we sat there talking and waiting. You look around and everyone has the same sad face of \"Where is my food?????\"  Finally, after over one hour..the food finally arrived. By now, my food has expanded so I am not that hungry anymore. My girlfriend ordered the Hog burger which came like 1 foot tall. I remember a clip of this shows of \"How do I even eat this burger? Its so damn bloody big\". Well, he probably didnt say that word from word but close enough. We wondered the same thing. You couldnt smash it down but you couldnt eat it like a normal burger. The Hog burger was mangalitsa pork, mangalitsa bacon, bbq pork, white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion, and slaw.  I ordered the \"Foie\" Burger which had pate foie gras (spread), chèvre, port wine aïoli, frisee. It had a decent foie spread but at the same time, it was a little tangy from the aoili. It was slighty more on the tangy side so it could put down some people who dont like that flavor contrast. Luckily, my burger was manageable and it really did come out medium rare like I requested. At least they did something right.   Overall, the server was great, the food was decent and the wait was horrible. I do not think I would return to this location when I am back in Vegas. Instead, I may check out his Steakhouse or go back to the Pub location."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, had the Euro burger, fries hand cut were good and champagne was tasty.   Very fond of burgers but these gourmet burgers you will want to eat and eat.   Great location and decor. Will return."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Gordan Ramsy's Burgr. It is located right by the Miracle Mile shops inside Planet Hollywood hotel and casino. I had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. They text you when they are ready for you which I thought was awesome-way better than the beepers they give you at other restaurants. They also gave you an Ipad to order your drinks and desserts on which I thought was a nice touch. I had a hard time choosing what burger to get because they all sounded so good! I ended up getting the Euro Burger because it had goat cheese and I loveee love goat cheese! We also got the sweet potato fries. Both were amazing! The sweet potato fries came with powered sugar and a jalapeno  mayo sauce that completed both flavors veryy well. The burger was great! I loved the goat cheese on it. We were also lucky enough to try the jalapeno poppers because the next table over gave us one to try! They were fabulous and the sauce it came with was awesome. I also tried the chocolate caramel pudding milkshake. I recommend this as well. It came with homemade whipped cream and a cookie on top. I've never had pudding with a milkshake so it made it unique and was a selling point for me. Next time I go back I want to try the push pops because those looked delicious as well! The service was good. I think our waitress was new but she was friendly. We didn't have to wait long for our food which is always great for me. If you are a burger fan I recommend trying this restaurant!"}
{"text":"There were 3 Hostess by the stand that were very rude, talking to each other and on their cell phones. Very bad first impression. They told us to go give our name to the other hosting standing to the left, very sweet young lady and we waited about 30 minutes. We are glad we stayed and waited. The wings were the highlight of our night, they were delicious. The burger was very good but not expectacular, my husband agreed Red Robin's Burgers are way better.  The ambiance is pretty cool and our server was very fast and efficient. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Not surprisingly enough, there was actually a line when the place opened, but it wasn't too long to get seated, fortunately.  I was half-expecting someone in the back of the kitchen to get yelled at, per the show.  Though, that wasn't the case.  With regards to the food, I ordered a oreo+butterscotch+creme brulee milkshake along with a Farm Burger and some truffle fries.  For a Gordon Ramsay establishment, it was actually reasonably good.  A lot better than I expected, as this was a chain of the other Ramsay restaurants.  I feel compelled to try his other joints now."}
{"text":"Another one of those things that I had to do because the wife loves Gordon Ramsay, and I'm not paying for the family to go to his steakhouse.  Anyway, about 15 people in line ahead of us for a late lunch, and the hostess said about 25 minutes.  Ugh - but it was only about 15 minutes.  Nice.  The menu is online so you know it's expensive.  About $12-16 for a burger.  Ordered burger and fries for everybody, but the waitress said most people end up sharing one order   - and she was right.  If you have a larger party, I recommend ordering all 3 fries - sweet potato, truffle parmesan, and plain fries and sharing, as each comes with its own delicious dipping sauces (honey jalapeno mayo and truffle aioli being my favorites.)  You can order the meat any way, meaning if you want a rare burger, they'll cook it.  It's a pretty casual place, located at the front of Planet Hollywood, so you don't have to walk through the casino if you're entering from the strip.  Hell's Kitchen burger had a nice kick to it, and I liked it better than the wife's Euro Burger (she loved hers though).  Service was good and if you watch any of GR's shows, you know you're pretty much guaranteed quality food and service.  Spent $105 before tax for 4 burgers, 3 fries, and 5 non-alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place solely because of Gordon Ramsay's name.   I had the farm burger and my girlfriend had the southern yard (chicken). We also ordered the truffle fries. Overall, the food was good but nothing out of the ordinary. We've had better burgers at cheaper prices but it's worth a visit if you're ever in PH in Vegas."}
{"text":"My second time here. We now have a different waiter who wouldn't let us split our shake even though there's pictures on here saying other customers can do that. I originally gave five stars but I can already tell I won't be enjoying this experience the way I did the first time.   First experience the hostess said they would text or call you after waiting in line but didn't. I had to ask twice to get seated. But!!! Our waiter was extremely helpful and food was perfect!!!   What a complete 360..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had recently tried GR pub & grill but this was our first trip to Burgr.  We will definitely go back to try the other burgers. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and regular fries. The regular fries come separate but are a huge portion and come with curry ketchup and Chipotle ketchup. My husband got the Chantarelle burger and sweet potato fries which come with a powdered sugar shaker and a sweet honey mustard. We also split a creme Brule oreo shake.  The burgers were tender and juicy and cooked to our preference.  The fries were delicious and the toppings went well with them and the shake was thick and creamy. Service was great and our water glasses were kept filled which we really appreciate."}
{"text":"The wait is about 45 minutes, which is to be expected at popular places on the strip (not too bad, I guess). I thought that the concept of this place is awesome; they have a big variety of beer and some very tasty shakes. The menu looks very appetizing and I have to say that I very much enjoyed the \"Gooey Fries\" (melted cheese, ham, and an egg sunny side up). I was thinking of giving this place another star but I that the burgers were just ok.  Maybe someone should yell at Gordon Ramsey for being just OK"}
{"text":"This was really a nice meal and is MUCH better than Ramsay's terrible \"pub\" down the road.  Server was excellent as was the food.  I enjoyed my Farm Burger and the rings and fries were really good too.  Beer selection was great and it was good and cold.  The bun on the burger was perhaps a bit too \"bunny\" but other than that.... good experience."}
{"text":"Great food for a reasonable price. I got the veggie burger (portobello mushroom) and then my partner and I shared some gooey fries minus the pastrami. He got...some kind of burger.   He said it was the best burger he had ever tasted. My veggie burger was pretty damn good. The ingredients tasted really fresh and it was like an explosion of different but complementary flavors.   Fries were good, but way too rich. All of it was really rich, actually. Portions are very generous. I wouldn't do the gooey fries again, because we both only picked at it. It would work well for a large group to share.   Would definitely return! (wait is a bit long, but it wasn't crazy)"}
{"text":"I was so lucky when I came here with three other people that there just happened to be a table for us. We literally walked right in - not sure what that was about. Like I said... lucky. I'd make sure you either have a table waiting for you or be prepared for a wait! This place gets a LOT of traffic and seems to be really popular. I never saw an empty table any time I walked by and I was staying in PH.  Service was great. I believe I just had a water (can't really remember) and had the Euro burger and the truffle fries.   I very much enjoyed my burger. The texture, flavors, and juices were there. It's times like those where I really wish that I could just order another because I was liking it that much. I also thought the fries were GREAT, both the fancy truffle and regular fries.   My friend got the burger with the blue cheese on it (I forget it's actual name) and both of us are blue cheese burger lovers - and this one was particularly lacking. :( It was bland. We both tried the others' burger and she really liked mine wayyy more than hers. Truthfully, if I had ordered that burger, my review would not be as good as it is. I would not order that, but would definitely recommend the Euro.   So the singular experience I had was a good one. It seems like it's hit or miss by the other reviews, though. I'd go back here if I didn't have to wait a really long time.   As a side note, I'm someone who has no known food-related allergies other than the slight reaction I have to lobster. About 30 minutes after my meal my gums/tongue/roof of my mouth went numb and actually hurt for about 24ish hours and well into the next night. I'm not sure if it's something in the seasonings or recipe, but I was slightly suspect. This would be the only deterrent, but I'm thinking it might have been the truffle fries (even though I've had truffle fries before with no issues)."}
{"text":"Definitely not as amazing as everyone made it out to be. Not particularly a burger connoisseur, but still not impressed   For the price it's incredibly reasonable, considering everything else in Vegas is super expensive.   Food is good, just not amazing."}
{"text":"I probably shouldn't have ordered both the truffle fries and the truffle burger. It was just an overload for me. Both were great...but again, just overload...too much fat intake all in one sitting.  Oh, and I still ordered a shake at the end too. Shake was good, but maybe because I had already lost rational thought, that ordering a shake was a good idea.  Oh well, lessons learned.   Also, if you want to avoid the line, just head straight to the bar. Bar staff are pretty funny."}
{"text":"Ok... I give this 5 stars and I HAVENT EVEN EATEN HERE!! i just was in planet hollywood and saw gordon ramseys restaurant sign and had to take a peek!! i love gordon Ramsey, i watch all his shows... so i really wanted to eat here.. so entusiastly i run into the restaurant with my mom and i look at all the people eating and i see these dilicious looking plates and the water is running out of my mouth from the hunger i was getting from it!! so i went over to the bar and asked for the menu and looked at it... oei a little bit expensive.. maybe not for the average vegas tourist, but for us who were visiting friends with low budget it was a bit pricy... for sure for being gordon ramseys food it must be worth it.. so i was looking for a free table but ofcourse, no free tables, then i take another look and see a huuuuuugh line waiting to get a table!! i invited myself in the restaurant what i think wasnt how its suppose to go!! haha but ok... so i got to see it..  it looks all great!! we were in a bit of a rush so we didnt have time to wait in line, and we had somuch things going on that unfortunately we didnt have a chance to go back.. but for sure gordon ramsay, i will try your food one way or the other when i will get that chance.. so far 5 stars..if you disappoint me, i can Always change it, but i have i feeling i wont have to !"}
{"text":"The burgers are very good and the truffle fries are soooo good!!! The dipping sauce was also super good!  The hubby complained it took a long time to get our food but it was our only complaint!"}
{"text":"When I saw the Hog Burger features on a Buzzfeed video, I just knew I had to come and try it myself.  The restaurant has a consistent line, from noon to 10pm. It wasn't too bad because the line moves pretty fast, the wait time was only 30 mins.  We went inside and ordered the poke sliders to start. The fish was perfectly seasoned, delicious and light. For mains, I got the hog burger and my bf got the Hells Kitchen burger (as recommended by our server). The hog burger was a dream! I was in pork heaven. Gotta say I felt really gross afterwards cause the pork burger was wrapped in bacon and as thick as my thumb. The HK's burger however was a definite miss, it had 0 heat and no flavor but definitely still well cooked. The Parmesan fries were pretty good too but we were pretty sure it was the homemade ketchup that made it from a 3 to a 4."}
{"text":"It will be a year on July 31 2015 since we've been here last. I ordered Hell's Kitchen burgR first and the next day (yes I went back) I ordered the HOG BURGR. My BF had the American Burger. My mouth waters just talking about it and remembering it. We also had ordered their AMAZING beer battered onion rings and also GR jalapeño poppers mmmmmmmmm I'm in love. Never could see another burger the same since.   PEOPLE....when your in Vegas come to this place.  We're coming back to Vegas on the same dates and will def be comin back to eat at GORDON RAMSEYS BURGR restaurant. It's the best ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger with the Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings and a wonderful Beer. The service was phenomenal although the wait for our food was a little lengthy. Let me tell you, fabulous dishes like this don't come at microwave speed so come prepared to wait, every bite thereafter is totally worth it. The chipotle Ketchup was pretty amazing... Everything tasted so fresh, the flavors just burst into your mouth. I'll be back EVERYTIME I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a late dinner.  We ate the American burger- cooked perfectly; earth burger- one of the best veggie burgers i've ever had; and the truffle parmesan fries were crispy and delicious.   Value for money and best burgers in town"}
{"text":"I went to BURGR with four other diners and our expectations were high. I'm guessing that mine were a little too high. The appetizers we got were the onion rings(AMAZING) and pork belly hot pockets. The hot pockets would have been perfect if it wasn't for the slimy, snot like sauce it had on the side. The burgers we had were delicious, stunning, well cooked, and huge!!  And if you want something that will fill you up and give you the biggest mouthgasm ever... get the Gooey Fries!! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen Burger: GET IT! It was extremely satisfying and I give extra kudos for the fresh avocado in the burger as well. I shared this with a friend (we split our burgers half and half so we could try two). She preferred her burgers well done so I thought that I wouldn't enjoy this burger as much but it was the opposite! I was surprised as well done burgers tend to taste like dry pieces of cardboard but at this location it was still moist, soft, and juicy.  Farm Burger: I wish I could've liked this dish more. I was super excited for it as it looks delicious in the pictures. Don't get me wrong the burger was still really good but was disappointed when there appeared to be random places during bites where I suddenly tasted a giant splash of salt in my mouth and then the dish would go back to being perfect on the next bite. I thought it may have been just a fluke for my burger but another friend had the same problem with her order. Medium rare was cooked pretty close to what it was suppose to be though it may have leaned a little closer to rare.   Truffle Fries: I was very satisfied with these fries. They really were delicious. I was expecting barely any truffle flavor to them as that is usually the case with things like this but they retained the flavor of the truffles well and definitely eat with the truffle sauce!   Sweet Potato Fries: it was delicious but I don't believe it was particular special or amazing.   Onion Rings: very satisfied with the onion rings. Fried to perfection and paired with two different sauces.  Pork Belly Hot Pockets: not worth $12 but I will admit I didn't actually eat this dish. I ordered it on accident expecting something else entirely. The waiter was kind enough to switch out my order for the onion rings.   Service: I don't usually comment on service unless the place was just that bad. The server was awesome and attentive and he gets extra points for putting a thank you with a smiley face on all the checks at our table :)"}
{"text":"The Truffle Parmesan Fries fries were the best. First time having them as wedges and not shoestring fries. Also the sweet potato fries come with an amazing light, yet creamy, sauce. I ordered the Earth burger, essentially the best vegetarian burger I've ever eaten. All the savory flavors of a beef burger but instead with a portabella mushroom. Sooo amazing!"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE burger fan.  I mean, I LOVE burgers, love them more than anything in the world.  In fact, I think that my overwhelming love of burgers kind of makes me an expert.  With that said, the burger here was good.  There were JUST a few things that could have been changed to make it GREAT.  I ordered the farm burger, and like the rest of my group, it was cooked just north of medium.  Also, the fried egg that was supposed to \"ooze\" as I bite into my burger did not ooze.  It really barely squished a bit.  THAT was most disappointing.  Despite the slightly over-cooked patty and the non-oozing fried egg, the burger was good.  If those two things had been on par, it probably would have been freakin delicious.  Along with the burgers, we also ordered the sweet potatoe fries and the garlic parmesan fries, and both were great, but ordinary.  Our server was awesome.  She was nice and super knowledgable about the menu and happily answered each and every question we had with extreme detail.    Oh yes, and the last thing I want to mention is that our food took a really long time to come out, at least 40 minutes.  I wanted to LOVE this place because I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, but I would say that with the amazing burgers all over Vegas, sadly I probably will never return."}
{"text":"Amazing Burger and Malt!! Service was really slow but friendly. All very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The best damn Onion Rings I've ever eaten!  Even my non onion ring eating wife fell in love with the food.  I mean common!!  This is ridiculously delicious.  For the price.  Those damn Milkshakes.  Never seen such a marvel of flavors.  Ohhh how I wish Sacramento, Ca, could take lessons on food from Gordon.  I had the fried Fish Sandwich and chips.   The best I've ever tasted.  Puts San Francisco, Fishermans Wharf to shame.  Highly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Love this place.  No reservation though, unlike other Gordon Ramsay joint in Vegas. This is the casal one between the three.  Burgers, and burgers and more burgers.  The deco is fun, the burgers are really great, I think actually is better than Bobby Fray's.  When you ask for medium rare, it really comes out as medium rare.  The dessert is decadent, fattening, loaded with calories but yummy.  I would not recommend people having it too often.   This place is located in Planet Hollywood in the strip, you can access it via the Miracle Miles, walk on the strip or drive and park in the garage.    Only thing is you got to queue up for the table, I was told the wait was half and hour but I got my table in 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Been trying to eat here for the past 11/2 made it today and it was totally worth it..: our waitress was Wendy and she was spectacular from helping us with beer selections and making sure we were ok... I had the Gordon Ramsey burgr and hubs had the truffle burgr and we split truffle parm fries... The food was so tasty I ate my entire burgr... Please go here... Worth ever bit of wait... Thank you for the great 1st visit experience Bodhgaya"}
{"text":"Delicious!   But don't order too much food.    This may have been too much for me to eat: - Euro Burger - Shake with chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee - Honey-Pig Bao Bun (1 out of an order of 3) - part of an order of Truffle Parmesan Fries  I'm gonna blame the shake for doing me in.  Also the bottom/end of the shake was all thick pudding, which was kinda not too appealing to me at the end, since the consistency at the top was more milkshake."}
{"text":"Burgers were alright. Service was good, took about 30 mins for our food to arrive. Makes sense since they were so busy."}
{"text":"My first time in vegas! And decided this would be the first dine in spot to go to. My god was it a great choice!  Been a big fan of Gordon Ramsay for a minute, and he did not disappoint, at all. Wasnt feeling the high table seating but the excellent service well made up for it.  Almost nutted in my pants from biting into \"The Farm Burger\" which consists of egg, duck bacon, and sharp cheddar. So on point! Sadly no other burger will ever taste the same...  Also highly recommend the jalapeno poppers, shit tasted so gourmet after being so used to eating jack-in-the-box jalapeno poppers"}
{"text":"Best burgers both my wife and I have ever had, and we have some pretty good burgers here in Denver. We both had the Hell's Kitchen spicy burger.  It is a little expensive, be prepared to pay $40 for 2 burgers and 1 side of fries (which is big enough to share). It's worth it though for a one time meal while in Vegas for some delicious burgers."}
{"text":"Been dreaming to come here ever since this restaurant opened. I finally got my chance. What can I say obviously the restaurant is on the strip so be prepared for the 15$ burgers. I ordered the medium rare Hell's Kitchen burger. I really enjoyed the tasted of the avocado and the roasted tomato. I couldn't taste the Jalapeño that much but I wish they could've added more avocado. We also ordered the Onion rings as well as the truffle fries. Onion rings were delicious as well as the truffle fries but we got full real fast. There was a line when we got there but waited probably 15 min before we got seated. Look and feel of the restaurant was awesome and the staff was friendly! I could not find a nutrition fact page anywhere on the internet but I'm telling myself if I don't know, the better. I would come here again but maybe on special occasion to try something new!!"}
{"text":"You know how sometimes you really really really don't want to like a place but you turn out to really really really LOVE a place? That was Burgr for me.   The wait was an hour. There were open tables everywhere. After 30 minutes and my friend winning $100 dollars, we go back and check with the host and she seats is immediately. Cool!   Our server Heather was amazing. Super nice and knowledgable. We wanted beers so she showed us a ipad with all the draught beers listed and even gave us samples.   We started with the Honey Pork Buns. $12 for two buns. Totally worth it. Pickled radish and pickled ginger? Yes please!   I got the Farm House Burger medium rare. My friend got the one with Truffle and Goat Cheese. Both burgers were full of flavor and all the simple ingredients mixed really well together. We shared Newcastle battered onion rings.   For dessert..... OMG.... The shakes.... Holy moly.... I got the creme Brûlée pudding with oreo shake and cookie. Whatever you do, get a shake. It's to die for. I can't even describe how good it is. Share it, too much for one person.   Two people with beers, app. Burgers, side, and dessert.... $80 for lunch. Not to shabby.   I would recommend this place and Guy Fieri's joint.   I am 95% sure this is better than Holstein's inside Cosmo. There is a 5% of doubt... Eeeeekkkk!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is F~A~N~C~Y pants and the dress code is BUSINESS CASUAL. If you're the type of person who loves life in the fast lane, old school diner atmosphere, street racing, race cars and all that stuff, this place is right up your alley.   ALL SERVERS HERE WERE FEMALE AND THEY ALL WORE SOME SEXY SHORT MINI SKIRT STYLE UNIFORMS. Man, I love Vegas!   FOOD:  Its a burger joint, so order a burger.   FARM BURGER W/ TRUFFLE CHEESE OREO CREME BRULEE SHAKE   SERVICE:  HOLY FXXK!!! My burger only took 35MINS?! Well it was Medium like I ordered it, so that was aite. I'm glad my server and waitress was ONE hot looking woman! She even make some of my ex-girlfriends look like chump change. I'm coming here with the guys more often just for the eye candy!!!  Overall:  Parking wasn't a problem, service was friendly, persuasive (meow) and courteous. I'm glad my food didn't disappoint either. RAMSAY, YOU GOT MY FXXKN RESPECT. I hear you say the \"F\" word all the time in your shows! xD"}
{"text":"I really liked this place a lot.  We ordered 4 burgers, 1 beer, sweet potato frieds, Parmesan fries and 2 shakes which was great.  It was very high tech, with the ipad to show us the different beers and the menu was on it. It reminds me of the Kitchen Nightmare's of how Chef Ramsay revamps. The management and waiters made sure everything was okay and the service was excellent.  The chef ramsay, great job of getting what the fans wanted a burger joint that is affordable.  Oh yes make sure you go get a club card to get a dollar off the food."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best burger I have ever had. If you like it a little spicy try the Hell's Kitchen sandwich."}
{"text":"Since this was a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, I had very high expectations for the place.....and they were met. Every burger on the menu sounded delicious so it was hard to pick! I ended up ordering the Farm Burger: Meat topped with fried egg, duck breast bacon, and English sharp cheddar cheese. It was delicious!   I can't wait to come back and try something new!"}
{"text":"Not good. The only way I can give 1 star is the onion rings. They were great. But the the burger was awful. I had the American burger but substituted cheddar cheese. Maybe that got them out of sorts. I ordered medium but it was served rare. It was inedible. Took a bite and that was all I could do. That was a $15 bite. Do not go here."}
{"text":"Modern sleak is what I'm thinking as I walk in to the restaurant. Hostess were both friendly as they greeted us and sat us down. It was hard but the live music was still booming behind us so hard to hear my husband. Hmm...chairs were squared and cushioned but was too low so it was a bit uncomfortable.   Our server, not friendly at all. He comes over and says \"you guys ready to order?\" What happened to \"hi my name is xxxx and I'll be your server this evening. Do you folks have any questions about the menu?\" Nope, none of that. As he asked he was looking around and not even looking at us. Yes I know you work out and probably have a 6 pack underneath that shirt. That does not make you a good server. Eye candy does not make the meal a wonderful experience if he's not friendly and rather be at home sleeping.   Now for the meal. My husband ordered the American burger and I the hog burger. Burger came on a black and white sesame seed bun and looked like a 1/3 lb patty with American cheese, lettuce and tomatoe. My hog burger was a gluten fest with pulled pork, bacon and my beef patty.  I didn't care that it was 11pm as we were on vacation and if I was going to be bad, I might as well go all the way. We also ordered the truffle friends. Burger came out medium as we like it and oh so juicy as we took our first bite. The juices from the beef, the bbq sauce, and the slaw just oozed down my chin. Yummy yummy. I know everyone liked the truffle fries but it was nothing special to my husband or me. We ate about 8 pieces total and just didn't care to continue. Oh and I forgot to mention that the fries came with two sauces but when our server dropped it off, he didn't bother to explain what they were.   Overall burger was delicious and wasn't more expensive than a regular burger elsewhere. You should give this place a try. The service I didn't care for so hopefully you don't get the same server. I really wanted to give this place 4 stars but just couldn't do it due to the poor customer service so I decided on 3 stars before I left. Then as I walked away the two hostess told us goodbye and to have a good evening. I'm a sucker so I added the extra star back on.   until next time Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here for my daughter's 15th birthday at her request.  Cocktails were AMAZING!!!  We ordered the onion rings for an appetizer, burgers for dinner.  I mentioned to the manager as he had asked us how our burgers were that it was my daughters birthday....he then surprised her with a complimentary dessert, which she loved!!"}
{"text":"The Hell's Kitchen burger was quite disappointing! I was hoping the jalapeños would give it a nice kick but the flavors were bland. Despite the mediocre flavors, Sergio is THE BEST server ever! He is so friendly without being invasive. My friend is gluten-free and he provided with so many recs for her to enjoy. He was simply wonderful and if you have him please tip him well!"}
{"text":"So excited to come here tonight! Love Gordon Ramsay! It lived up to all my expectations and more. The service was fantastic and our waitress was amazing! My husband and I both had incredible burgers, a great milk shake and the sweet potato fries were killer! I'm already craving it again! 5 star meal and with water we got out the door for 60$. Not bad dinner for 2!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a 6th star! This was the first meal that I had when visiting Vegas last week and it was a great way to start off the vacation. The restaurant is located in Planet Hollywood and is right next to the Miracle Mile Shops (right in the center of the strip). We walked from The Venetian, if that helps with location. Even if you are far away, I think this place is worth a side trip!   Even if you don't eat meat, you can indulge here. We had non-meat eaters in our group who had the Earth Burger (portobello mushroom, fontina, veggies) and the Fish & Crisp Sandwich (this thing was ENORMOUS). Both were very happy with their food! On the carnivore side, the Euro Burger was absolutely amazing...truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and roasted tomato. The burger was cooked to perfection (medium rare). Sooooooo flavorful and totally exceeded my expectations. The truffle fries were also fantastic and came with truffle aioli and curry ketchup for dipping. YUM! Burgers range from $13-$16 and the fries were $11 ($8 for plain fries). It is pricey, but totally worth it and you can split the food without any sharing charge. The beer menu was also very impressive featuring many craft beers of all styles.   The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive. We had a few waiters visit our table and they were constantly filling waters and asking if we needed anything. One of our partygoers had a birthday and the staff didn't hesitate to bring a birthday dessert while singing Happy Birthday. Perhaps the best push pops I've ever tasted with layers of vanilla ice cream, peanut butter ice cream and cake. Overall, I was not disappointed in any way whatsoever!"}
{"text":"We did not have to wait long to get a seat, they move people quickly. Got a lettuce wrap burger - the patty was cooked perfectly, but part of my soul wanted it to be raw so I can shout out \"RAW! F@$&ing RAW!\" I wish I ordered more fries, but didn't need that. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with the food at this restaurant. I expected more from the great Gordo. Our table ordered the onion rings, jalepeno poppers, hell's kitchen burger and duck breast burger.  The onion rings were my favorite part. The burgers don't come with any sides so you have to order them separately. The meat in my duck bacon burger was dense but other than that, the meat was mediocre and the toppings lacking.  I think burgers priest has a better, more juicy burger. The service was good though."}
{"text":"I was expecting to like this place better, given how much I enjoyed the food at Gordon Ramsay Pub in Caesars.  Burgr has the drink menu on the iPad, which is common to all of Ramsay's locations in Vegas.  I didn't partake, but there was a lemonade and vodka drink that was popular with the couple we ate with.  To start, we had jalapeno poppers.  These are large, and come 6 to an order.  They are served in shot glasses with an excellent ranch sauce at the bottom.  In an interesting twist, they don't tell you which one has the seeds still in it.  Seeds are what gives jalapenos their heat, so that one is noticeably hotter than the rest.  I got it in our order, which is good because I like hot stuff.   I had the cheesy burger with added duck bacon.  Be advised they burgers don't come with veggies or sauces on the side, so you have to ask for them.  The burger was a perfect medium, but lacked flavor.  It cleary is very good quality meat, but was underseasoned.  I had to put the truffle mayo on it, which was served as a side to the truffle parmesan fries.  These were excellent, and I don't usually care for thick-cut fries.  But, the truffle flavor came through, and the mayo was an excellent dipping sauce.  I didn't much care for the housemade ketchup, too sweet for me.  The wife had the maytag blue cheese burger, which was delicious, but only because it had such a large amount of blue cheese on it.  I think anything with that much maytag would be great.    All in all, the appetizer and fries were the most memorable part of our lunch.  And, that's not how it should be at a high end burger joint.  I may return if someone visits and wants to go, but I doubt it.  Would probably direct them across the street and up a block to Gordon Ramsay Pub at Caesars..."}
{"text":"By far its the best burger in the world, I try burgers everywhere but this one is real, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. Cant wait to try Gordon's steakhouse too! Will be craving this burger now."}
{"text":"We get in line and after about 10 minutes, one of the hostesses walks the line and asks if we have a reservation.  No, we don't.  Then, she asks how many in our party?  Two.  Ok, she says, it will be about a 15 to 20 minute wait.  Ok, we decide to stay.  I ask if the bar area is first come, first serve.  I'm told that the bar is being seated just like the rest of the restaurant.  45 minutes later, we are almost to the front.    So, we are in the front (right next to the reception desk) and can see the bar area.  One couple leaves, then immediately a guy sits down, then pulls out his phone and calls his wife/girlfriend to come join him.  I heard him say \"I got a seat.\"  A few minutes later a woman walks up and sits next to him.  They high five each other, so I'm thinking to myself that they just sat down when the seats opened.  He called her because she was in line waiting.  I ask one of the women at the front if the bar is first come, first served, and she again says that you need to wait to be seated at the bar just like the rest of the restaurant.    OK, I tell her, but I just saw a guy sit down without being seated.  She says to me, \"I don't know anything about that\" then walks away.  That kind of annoyed me that A) she didn't bother to find out further what happened and B) that she just almost ignored me and walked away.  We wait about 10 minutes more and get a seat in the restaurant.  The restaurant is sooooo busy that I think the workers have a hard time giving the best service that they can.  We wait for 10 minutes before someone comes to our table to take our drink order, then another 10 minutes before the drinks arrive, then after we order, it takes the food about 25 minutes to arrive and one burger comes out, but not the other one, so I'm sitting there without food while my friend is eating her burger that she is thoroughly enjoying.  I have a few french fries, but they are normal fries and nothing special.  After I ask about my burger, it comes out after 5 minutes.  My friend has finished eating, so I'm eating my burger and I don't like all the fancy stuff, so mine doesn't taste much different than any other burger that I have eaten.  In fact, the bun is not that soft, so it's not great.  Needless to say, I would not return to Burgr if Gordon Ramsay paid me.  The line is too long and the food is just blah.    You can check out my pictures.  Xie Xie"}
{"text":"Finally.  A world class burger.  Quality, not quantity here folks.  Tender and delicious..."}
{"text":"The place was packed on a Monday night and the line long, we almost left. The hostess said 20 minute wait; but, we were seated in less than 10 minutes.  Glad we waited.   We had great service and good food.  The truffle fries were our favorite  I really liked the Hells Kitchen burger.   The blue cheese burger was over powered by the cheese and the burger flavor was lost.  The toffee pudding ice cream pops were not good.  We walked here from Saxe Theatre where we saw the lame Vegas The Show!  The next day we had an amazing  8 mile hike outside of Red Rock."}
{"text":"Again, checked in and headed over here after our 3.5 hour drive in from L.A. Needed a burger and beer. Wife and I had such a great time here first time in January, we had to come back. I had the Britannia Burger, medium. It was good! I felt the arugula was a little too peppery for this burger and overpowered the cheddar. I think the mango chutney ended up on only half of the burger.  A thicker cut of cheese on this one would definitely bring it up to great burger standards. Wife and I were smarter this time and only shared one order of fries!!"}
{"text":"Pros:  The jalapeno poppers!  I'd give 'em four stars.  Very tasty!  Another pro is the white truffle fries, thick cut, with parmesan cheese and a homemade garlic aioli and ketchup.  Super tasty....  However, the con is that this is NOT the burger it's cracked up to be.  Mediocre at best.  The \"uber cheeseburger\" is what I ordered.  It didn't have much cheese on it, and the bun didn't taste fresh...it was kind of stale/hard.  I asked for my burger to be cooked medium, but it was more like medium rare. I ate it anyway, because I know they grind their own meat, which lowers the risk of food poisoning.  Another con is the noise level.  Forget trying to have a conversation with your dining companion - not that you'd want to - but it would be nice not to have to shout.  And there's TV's with sports all over the place....I don't care for a \"sports bar\" type of atmosphere.  I would do back, but this place didn't live up to the hype for me.  And the wait staff is overly friendly....it comes off as phony and a bit pretentious."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch! Megan was our server, she was very helpful and attentive! She also gave us information about the chef and Gordon Ramsay. The food is awesome and the truffle fries with the dip! Yummmm. I ordered the euro burger and it was bomb! Restaurant was very clean. The wait wasn't that bad. I would definitely recommend and come back next time I'm around the area!"}
{"text":"I just thought this place was okay. Not great. With GR's name on it, maybe my expectations were high.   I ordered the American burger. My dining partner ordered the Farm burger. He loved his. Called it a top 5 burger of his lifetime. He said the duck bacon was more like a jerky than bacon. My burger was super underwhelming. I probably should have been more adventurous in my choice, but I went with what I thought was safe. It was just too gourmet for me. And dry. I'm not used to a burger with absolutely no sauce of any kind.   We also got fries. They had oil and herbs on them, but almost no salt. They came with two different ketchups. A spicy chipotle and I think curry was the other. They were interesting. My partner was impressed but they were too spicy for me.   All in all, if you like gourmet, fancy burgers, try it. The place was packed and had a line out the door so they are doing something right. Just not really my style. I enjoyed Bobby Flay's Burger Palace quite a bit better."}
{"text":"We definitely gave Gordon Ramsay a bunch of money this time we went to LV. Steakhouse and then Burgr.   My friend and I got there right as they were opening so it was easy to get a spot. Get there early and it'll be good. The line was probably 10 tables waiting in line, but it seemed like they were trying to seat everyone as soon as possible.   We ordered the jalapeno poppers to share. 6 of them, 3 each. They were a bit spicy for my tastes even using the ranch dressing that came with it. I had to drench it in the sauce, but I think that seeds were still in the jalapeno so it was spicy! (at least for me).   I ended up ordering the Farm Burger (duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, fried egg). Honestly, the burger was a bit more done than I wanted it. However, the duck breast bacon - that is good. I wanted more of that. I cut it in half and the egg was gooey and flowed out. So delicious.   Overall, great place to get a good burger. More expensive than a burger from a fast food place, but it was definitely good.   Protip: get there early to not wait long to get a table. Duck breast bacon is as delicious as it sounds."}
{"text":"We came here at some profane hour to grab a bite to eat after our drive from LA. The place was beautiful-- holy cow!! (heh heh). The decor was tasteful and unique; it definitely felt like a higher-end burger joint. Service was also great. Our server was attentive, helpful, and enthusiastic.   My friend and I split a Euro Burger and we got the sweet potato fries to split between 4 of us. They brought out the burger already cut in half with an extra plate, which was super nice. The burger itself was pretty good, but a bit on the pricey end for what you get ($16). It wasn't the greatest burger I've ever had, but was still interesting and tasty. The Euro burger had truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomato. The goat cheese was pretty prevalent, but the other ingredients were pretty forgettable. The sweet potato fries ($9) were amaze! I'm not really a huge fan of sweet potato fries, but these were so unique that you can't not like them. First of all, the presentation is pretty intriguing-- the healthy dose of crisp, piping hot fries are served in a metal cone alongside a shaker of vanilla powdered sugar and a side of honey jalapeño mayo. (Ew, the more I think about dipping fries in mayo, I get grossed out. At the time, these were delicious.) The truffle fries scent was pretty much wafting throughout the restaurant, so I'd definitely like to try these next time.   It's worth checking out, but more for the non-burger parts of their menu. I personally liked Holsteins better!"}
{"text":"The burgers, fries and wings are excellent. Shakes are amazing. All of the food is well-prepared and delicious. Service is outstanding! If it's good enough for Gordon, it's good enough for you!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are soo juicy and tasty.  I got the farm burger which has duck bacon and a fried egg.  I love how the egg oozes over the burger.  Definitely one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Their onion rings are also really good.  Very crispy.   The hostesses can improve their attitudes though.  I've been here a couple times and both times the hostesses never cracked a smile and had a really stuck up attitude."}
{"text":"I went here for NYE weekend. This wasn't an intentional visit, we were going to eat someplace else but settled on this instead.   Surprisingly enough it was really really good. The fries were great, the burger was cooked to perfection and I even indulged myself and got a peanut butter shake.   Service was a bit slow, but my server was really polite. I would have liked it if they refilled my drinks more often but there was an enormous amount of people eating here for NYE weekend so I gave them a pass.   Overall, if your in the area and are in the mood for just comfort burger food while watching a game check this place out."}
{"text":"I love everything Gordon Ramsay. This is actually my second time at BurGR and I'm surprised that I didn't write a review.  It's at such a convenient location on the strip - in Planet Hollywood which is fairly central. The line for me went by really quickly, but I guess that's also because I decided to sit at the bar.  I ordered the Britannia burger while my significant other ordered the burger with blue cheese - both cooked to perfection. The meat was perfectly seasoned, which I can totally appreciate, and the buns were neither too hard nor too soft (i.e., soggy) - it was just right!  They also have Boddington's on tap. Like Joey (from Friends) - I'd walk back to London to have another one of those frosty bad boys."}
{"text":"I wish it was the best burger I've ever had but it wasn't. It was good but the meat was under seasoned. The bread was ok, kinda dry. I thought it was fairly priced for the size of the burger. Overall ok."}
{"text":"Waited in line for about 30 minutes for a table. This was at 9pm.  The service was great. We were greeted right away at our table, offered drinks and then menu. We had decided our orders before we were sat, so we ordered right away.  The burgers came out in a reasonable time, and were pretty good. They were cooked exactly how we liked them. We also ordered truffle fries which came with two different dipping sauces: a siracha ketchup and a garlic aioli. The aioli was not that great, and smelled kinda weird. The other one was pretty good.  They also have a decent beer selection, though it mirrored mostly what Vegas establishments are selling at the moment. (As of now, you'll see about the same 8-10 beers at any bar).  I feel like the restaurant was a bit over-hyped, but if not busy I would probably go back. My biggest complaint was the price. They are very proud of their burgers, and that will reflect on the bill."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best tasting burgers I have ever had! I had the farm burger and my hubby had the Gordon burger (not on the menu). We both left stuffed! The parmesan fries were so yummy as well, best I've ever had! Gordon really knows what he's doing! We will be back."}
{"text":"Crazy good eats in a cool Vegas setting. Nothing we had disappointed, prices are high as expected when dining in Vegas, service was up to par, and waitlist times can be waaaaay long depending on when you go.   Definitely worth going at least once, given the multitude of options to eat on the strip."}
{"text":"Come here with an empty stomach, ready to chow down! My boyfriend and I split the goooey fries (not sure how to spell that), and we were pretty stuffed after this delicious cheesy treat! After the fries, I got the American burger and he got the Hell's Kitchen burger. The bun was perfect, and the combination of ingredients was just right. Even though they were extremely busy, our waiter was very attentive, helpful, and had a great personality... made it an overall quality A+ experience."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner on a Friday and waited about 10 minutes before we got out two person table. We ordered the gooey fried which are a MUST!! Between the fry appetizer and the burgers we ordered, we were too full to try a milkshake so maybe next time :) our server was also awesome!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch before EDC with my girlfriend on a beautiful hot sunny day. The line didn't look long but it took 30mins to get a table. Which I didn't mind considering this restaurant was featured many times on food network, its Gordon Ramsay restaurant AND it's on the STRIP, come on. It's Vegas, one of the BIGGEST tourist spot in the country, if you want good food, you're going to have to wait. Our server Matt was fast, responsive, friendly and very descriptive towards educating us about the menu. This was our first time so Matt did us the biggest favor by going over the menu without me having to ask, which I highly appreciate. Matt if you're reading this, we want you to know that we think you're a great asset to this restaurant and we can't thank you enough for the excellent customer service, we will be coming back in hopes we have you as our server again! The food was absolutely AMAZING. I wouldn't change a thing. My girlfriend and I got the Farm Burger, the sliders and the sweet potato fries. First bite on all three blew me away, no really, man was it good. Don't listen to all these other haters on yelp saying negative feedback about this restaurant, you're definitely getting your money's worth here. If you think about it, BJ's has the similar price range and it's no where as good as this AND it's in VEGAS (because we all know prices go up just because it's on the strip). I'm actually considering staying at a hotel close by the next time I'm in LV just because of this place. Look no further, this is a place you don't want to miss out on! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Sweet Potato Fries and the new addition to the menu Hog BurGR.  Both were great choices and although I try to watch my portions, I definitely went way over my limit and finished the whole meal!  I will definitely revisit and refer to everyone."}
{"text":"I've eaten in this restaurant for 4 times already. I definitely love this place. My first experience with the Truffle Parmesan Fries was phenomenon. However, when i visited for the second time, the fries were not as truffly as the first time I'd tried. Then the third time i ordered, it got better. They should control their product consistency.  My goal is to try all shakes on the menu. I tried the Oreo, Coffee, Strawberry, and Banana. So far, my favorite is Coffee. All of their shakes are super thick and sweet and especially the Oreo was too sweet for me (I love sweets, when i say it is sweet, it is really sweet.) Who ever created this shake menu, I have a huge respect on him or her."}
{"text":"Burger had good flavor, truffle fries were great. Slightly overpriced for what you got."}
{"text":"Very good burgers Attractive decor Good fries. Moderately priced for Vegas Good service  Not too long of a wait time on a Friday night"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were really intrigued by this place because we're big fans of GR's tv shows and just the overall hype on his cooking history. This is probably the most excited we've been entering a restaurant. We expected top notch food and we got exactly that! Best onion rings ever and the burgers were insane; they had a very unprecedented flavor. We are definitely going back when we are able. 100% satisfied. From the atmosphere, to service, to the food... everything was what we expected and more. Burgr is fantastic and you should really try it. Freakin sensational."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool stop in vegas....good dawgs and burgers!  Great beer selection , chainbreaker was my favorite.  Service was excellent...kitchen was a bit slow but they were packed and the waitress and manager were extremely attentive and always made sure we were ok with our drinks . A++ service!"}
{"text":"All my food was very tasty here. I rarely give 5 stars but Alex with the glasses made my experience all the more special. He knew our table's taste buds down to a t! My mom is a picky eater and likes simple foods but he picked out a great burger and beer and she had no complaints. She was even surprised that she liked duck bacon. He suggested I get a half Guinness and half Sam Adams cherry wheat beer which was also great! The sticky toffee pudding in the push pop form is a must! I had the the chanterelle mushroom burger which was excellent. The food alone is worth 4 stars but Alex with the glasses made me give 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We ate at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR on Friday. Probably the BEST burger I have ever had, gonna have to try it a few more times to confirm. The meat was seasoned just right and it just melts in yo mouf! This is the Hell's Kitchen Burger, tried the Farm Burger and that was absolutely delicious. I think the fries could be split between 4 people, it was hard for me to leave those behind, but I was just way too full (could be because I also had half of cousins Farm...score)!"}
{"text":"I been wanting to try this place for a long time since I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsay. We had a 2 hour wait but you can leave and they'll text you when the table is ready.  If you have the casino members card, you get $1 off each menu item. So while you're waiting for your table, go get the players card.   The restaurant doesn't have tables for groups larger than about 4 so you would have to split up. We had a group of 7 but they sat us in a area about right next to reach other.  Customer service was spot on. Very friendly and informative waiters.   Here was what we ordered: Shake #4 creme brulee pudding + Oreo shake + Oreo cookie = best shake ever!!!! LOVED IT since I love both of those, this was a perfect combo! The drink isn't super thick and milky surprisingly but more creamy. I couldn't stop drinking it. It actually made me full from eating my burger lol.  Honey pig bao buns - roasted pork belly, pickled cucumber and radish, cilantro and honey hoisin sauce. It was good but I did wish the roasted pork belly was crunchy. It was soft though. The bun was very moist and soft. Overall, I liked it because of the pickled toppings that went with it.   Farm burger- duck breast bacon cheddar and fried egg. This was one of the best burger I have had in a long time! They egg yolk was perfectly cooked to how I like it, runny. The duck breast bacon was good but a little too salty but still good. The hamburger buns were very fluffy and compliment the burger meat well. It did not overwhelm the burger.   My husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was very spicy but he loved it. The avocado was delicious with the burger. Meat was juicy and the burger was very flavorful. The bun on this burger was the same as the farm burger. Fluffy and went well with the burger.  My siblings got the Hog Burger and enjoyed it very much so. Juicy, cooked to perfection of medium rare with the awesome bun.   We would all come back here again next time. Totally worth your money!"}
{"text":"I'm having a hard time giving BurGR 3 stars.  I love Gordon Ramsey and our apps were very good!  We had the wings (so fun with only the one bone), jalapeno poppers (so spicy!!!), truffle fries, regular fries and onion rings with our burgers.  I loved the truffle fires and one of the best onion rings I've ever had.  But....the wait time to get our food was sooooooooo long and my patty was almost raw.  Like that gross feeling of raw ground meat in your mouth...boo.  And I had the Britania burger but i swear i never tasted the chutney.  oh well.  We came here because my brother and his friend had lunch here the day before and they said their burgers were so good (one of them had the farm burger, I can't remember what the other one was).  But even they weren't as impressed with BurGR the next day.  If I visit again, I think I'll get one of the gorgeously delicious hot dogs I saw passing by.  And I'll make sure I have a bunch of time to kill as i wait around waiting for my food."}
{"text":"This review is a few weeks late but...it's true! The most incredible burgers ever! And I'm not even a huge beef fan. I had the Farm Burger; it was EPIC. Also tried my friend's Hell's Kitchen Burger, a tad on the spicy side. Both were cooked to a medium rare perfection, just the right serving size, and the price isn't too much for the quality!   Oh and you are going to want to try the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers. Delicious and awesome presentation.  Only downside I can think of is the wait time. We waited a good 45-50 minutes for a table on a late Monday afternoon. But Miracle Mile is right there for the browsing and does a good job of working up your appetite! I totally think it was worth the wait and would gladly wait again. Definitely one of the highlights of my last Vegas trip, without a doubt, and can't wait to go back to try another fantastic burger.   Good job as usual, Mr. Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great tasting food full of flavored. The service was great and the food was truly great. The price is fair for the quality that you get. I will be going back, I recommend the truffle fries and uber cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Long wait time on a Monday at 2:30PM. Another long wait to get food after ordering. Burgers were good but not great. Just too busy to really enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and service from Chris was excellent.  A review suggested making reservations so I made them.  Upon arrival I was told they don't take reservation and had to wait 1 1/2 hours.  After complaining to manager, he sat us after being rude and acting as if i was lying.  Onion rings were chewy not crispy.  Wings and jalapeño bottle caps excellent.  Hell's Kitchen burger is over-rated.  Britannia burger mediocre.  Food is a 3 1/2 stars and atmosphere a 4 stars."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times now and first time it wasn't so great as I ordered their not so popular Burger - chicken burger and it came with a bone . They quickly replaced it with a brand new burger though .   However , last time me and my husband went and it's totally changed my views as I guess we've ordered the right things - Blue burger and my husband had the Hell's Kitchen Burger . And man they were both freakin delicious . Please do order those things - you will thank me later . Also their jalapeño poppers were very yummy as well and well presented ! We also ordered their gooey fries which was quite good too. Worked perfectly for my husband as he loves and needs eggs in the mornings lol I've had truffle Parmesan fries before and those I liked better personally .   Overall a great experience and I will go back everytime I get a chance now ."}
{"text":"My most recent visit to this fine establishment was for a hangover recovery Friday brunch. While this place is definitely a little \"tourist-y\" (even for the strip) the food and service on both of my visits have been absolutely on point. The farm burger  with the duck bacon is about about as decadent as it comes but in a good \" can't wait to finish it\" way. The fries and onion ring were also  as good as it gets at any burger joint. If I had one minor \" beef\" ( get it? ..) it would be my farm burger came out slightly over the medium rare that was ordered. All in all, you could do A LOT worse if you were in the mood for a touristy celeb chef vanity restaurant then then this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Everything is spot on. Nice decor. Best fish and chips l had for a long time. Love it very much."}
{"text":"Best Burger I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Hate to do this, Gordon Ramsay is undoubtedly a culinary genius and restaurateur. Our experience at this restaurant, however, was less than extraordinary. The food itself varied from okay to great and our server gave good service along with the rest of the staff supporting her on refills and pre-bussing. It was management that kind of soured the meal at the end.  Shortly after the check was dropped, our server returned to our table to retrieve it saying her manager had forgotten to add the gratuity. Unfortunately for her, we were already ready to pay with cash that included a 20% tip and although I'm sure she didn't mean it, some of the guests in our party were offended by this. She returned with the new check which included the 18% gratuity and we voiced our concerns to her about the unintentional implication that was being made by her tacking on the gratuity after she had already dropped the bill... She apologized profusely and left to give us some time to pay.  Then we found another issue on our check... A portion of it should have already been paid for by one of our guests who had paid on his card for his own portion of the meal. He was already cashed out and his credit card slip was signed. However the total still included his items giving us an incorrect amount to pay. We brought this up to our server who explained that we just needed to subtract what he paid from the total shown because apparently their system cannot take the items off the bill or subtract any amount already paid for? Being in the industry, I'm not sure why their system would be lacking functions such as splitting off items to a new/separate check or showing a remaining balance after any initial payment. A manager was brought to the table to reiterate what she had just explained. However the problem with this is that we were NOT informed of this system glitch beforehand or even when she had given us the check until we raised it as an issue. Had we trusted the establishment and not looked closely at the bill, we would have overpayed by $30+. We agreed our server had no bad intent to deliberately keep us in the dark but as a customer, it's hard to feel empathetic after all these issues. ALSO WE CAME HERE TO EAT, NOT DO MATH.  Finally after all this, we found a final flaw on our check. The gratuity and tax was taken from the total bill, not from the remaining balance after the payment from our one guest. This means the that the grat and tax was higher than what it was supposed to be but by this time we were so sick of everything that we decided to just drop it, pay and leave.  TL;DR CHECK YOUR BILL THOROUGHLY BEFORE YOU LEAVE MONEY TO PAY. ALSO BE READY TO DO THE MATH ON YOUR OWN CHECK SHOULD YOU SPLIT PAYMENTS BECAUSE THE COMPUTER FOR SOME REASON WILL NOT DO THE MATH FOR YOU.  P.S. The highlight of this dining experience was the jalapeno poppers. They are delicious. If you do decide to dine here order them. The hot dog is very salty. Our burger came out rare and barely warm when we asked for medium rare.  I might give this place another try but with much lower expectations."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place!!!! Have been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. All appetizers & fries are yummy. Burgers are rich & tasty, the farm, Hell's Kitchen, euro, damnation & fish and crisp sandwich are all worth trying. Great beer selection, along with the milkshakes!!! Bring your appetite."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and had dinner at Ramsay's steak the night before but....  I went  to have dinner at Ramsay's burgr on a Sunday night and was told that I could not eat there because we were a party of three. They would only seat parties of two or four. Give me a break are you that hard up for $$$$$$$$$ sounds like it ."}
{"text":"I think Gordon Ramsay is pretty cool, so I wanted to try one of his restaurants while we were in Vegas.  I liked the menu from BurGR best and it was in our hotel, so we checked it out for lunch on our first day.  We did not wait in line, but it was around lunchtime on a Wednesday, so I'm sure that's why, as we saw other times the line was quite long, usually for dinner.  We ordered a tangerine/vodka drink and a Guinness type shooter.  He enjoyed the shooter, I didn't really care for the tangerine flavor of my drink, although I was told it is their most popular drink.  For our meal, he ordered the piggies in blankets ($12) and I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger ($15) and truffle parmesan fries ($11).  The prices seemed really reasonable to me.  He thought the piggies in blankets were great.  My burger was cooked perfectly - it comes with avocado, roasted jalapeno, asadero cheese, roasted tomato and jalapeno pesto aioli.  It was delicious!  I could really taste the flavor of the meat and all the ingredients seemed to go together well.  It was not too spicy, except for one bite with a lot of jalapeno was!  The burger wasn't quite as \"wet\" as I like, so I dipped it in the truffle aioli that came with the fries and it was amazing.  The truffle fries were so flavorful and melted in my mouth.  With truffle parmesan, truffle salt and truffle aioli, I don't know how you could think they didn't have enough truffle.  They also came with a housemade ketchup which I thought had a unique taste and wasn't just plain, out of the bottle Heinz.    Service was attentive, and although our initial server disappeared after taking our order (and reappeared with the check), another server took over and made sure to check on us regularly.  I felt like the kitchen was ensuring they lived up to GR's standards.  I would have come back here a second time while we were in Vegas, but my significant other likes to vary his food choices.  That just means I'll have to come to Vegas again!"}
{"text":"So I kind of wanted this place to suck just so I could quietly mock Gordon Ramsey's giant ego while watching his 700 television shows. I figured he was so full of himself that this probably wouldn't deliver.  ...but that little egotistical dope proved me wrong.  After waiting in a line as long as the Space Mountain queue my friend and I were finally seated at the high tables (because waiting for a real table would have taken even more time). After being seated and our drink orders were submitted and we opened our menus. A giant picture of GR - lovely. So obsessed with himself.  Anyway, after scrolling the menu - We made our decisions. Both would be getting the farm burger (i added grilled onions). We also ordered the parm fries to share.   Soon enough our food arrived and the presentation was on point. Still hesitant, I bit down. F word. This BurGR was good. I hate you Gordon Ramsey.  Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. I was full about half way through, but this lady pulled a fatty move and finished every freakin bite. Every last delicious one.   The fries however, weren't worth mentioning really. Overpriced and under delivered. I wasn't a huge fan. The dipping sauce was good, but I probably wouldn't bother ordering them again. Luckily we split them - and there were plenty to be split.   Also, I really wish I had more room because the shakes and desserts sounded absolutely incredible. I might have to take a special dessert trip just to try them. Or have a burger, do some shopping in PH and come back? Yeah good plan.   All in all, this place is delicious. I could do without all the damn selfies of GR, but other than that - the decor was nice. Modern, clean, open.   I will definitely be back. It will probably be my go to spot for Vegas lunch/dinners.  It's pricey, but it's worth it. Don't tell Gordon."}
{"text":"Great food.... horrible table. Sat at a table right by the host stand, right next to an entrance of the hotel. Couldn't even here our server speak. Felt like we were sitting in a good court. Beer came out really fast."}
{"text":"Delicious!! We watch Gordon Ramsay's shows and were excited to try his food. The shake my husband had was incredible, an Oreo shake topped with creme brûlée pudding! We went around 12 on a weekday and had a very short wait. Great service, food came quickly. I recommend the shake #4, roasted jalapeño poppers, southern yardbird burger, and Hell's Kitchen burger. I didn't love the fries but everything else exceeded my expectations!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch around 3 and there was no wait. The waitress came right away and gave us water. We ordered the Gordon Ramsey burger and the burger with Carmelized onions and arugula. The burger was small but cooked to a perfect medium rare.  I enjoyed both burgers but like the onion one more because it was sweet and savory. The arugula also cut through the heaviness to offer a more balanced and refreshing flavor. We also ordered the truffle fries the aioli is bomb! We ate the fries until the sauce was gone.     I don't know if I will come back anytime soon because there are too many places to explore. However I would definitely recommend it to burger lovers but tell them not to have too high of expectations."}
{"text":"Great place the burgers and onion rings tasted great.Our server was wonderful,she helped us decide on what certain type of food she liked to eat with her husband..The restaurant was clean... The buffallo wings tasted fabulous,the sauce they give you with them tasted great...10 stars I give the Chef.."}
{"text":"I Googled \"best sweet potato fries in Las Vegas\" and this was the number one result. Google did not steer me wrong. Absolutely fantastic! (The burgers were amazing as well.)"}
{"text":"this was my forth time coming to this restaurant and things have changed (for the worst).  the burger which was the stable of this establishment was a dried out tiny perfectly formed and pressed portion of meat. now  being a burger aficionado, i swear was frozen! a sentiment of my entire group that ordered the burger or burgr. as gordon likes to call them.   also the hot dog was rabid.the party that made the mistake of eating it was sick as a dog that eve and could not make it to dinner later that evening.   the only thing worse than the food was the service which was non-existent. we actually had to run up to the bar to order our drinks.  i'm thinking of starting a reality show where i review various  bad eateries and was going to start here.  a penny for you thoughts (just not one of these burgers), yes?"}
{"text":"Omg!!! Pretty much sums it up!  This was my third time coming here. It's a must whenever you visit Vegas.  I had the roasted jalapeño poppers+Euro burger+gooey fries+ number 4  creme brûlée and Oreo shake. It was all amazing! The euro burger is by far the best on the menu, flavor is delish!  It was my first time trying The gooey fries  and I loved them! Size is perfect for sharing.  Don't forget to try the shake, you won't regret it!  I literally only ate half of everything and had enough for another meal!"}
{"text":"I have to say I absolutely loved this place, it is the best place to eat at Planet Hollywood. I get the Farm Burger which is cooked to perfection on a very fluffy bun and the sweet potato fries are to die for. It is a little pricey but definitely worth it. We also got the shake which was rich with REAL chocolate and had a very unique taste.   We got in super fast because we are Platinum Members at the casino but if you are just visiting the line does look very long so that is the only reason I gave it a 4/5, but trust me the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen burger, part deux, and I was once again, not disappointed.  This time I ordered it medium well again, but this time it came out perfect.  I just freaking love this burger.  Roasted tomato, asadero cheese, avocado, delicious.  The truffle fries this time around we sub par.  Soggy fries are not my friend.  These are thick cut fries, so it's easy to see how they can end up being soggy, but this place should know how to do fries at the very least.    The shakes here are interesting.  They are ginormous, so definitely think about sharing them.  They are also super sweet.  I know what you are thinking.  Me, the dessert whore that I am, thinking something is too sweet.  Well, take my word for it.  If you're not into super sweet desserts, you might want to pass on the shake.  The shake is milkshake on the bottom, pudding on the top, topped with whipped cream and garnished with a cookie.  I was 1/4 into it and had to stop.  It was just too much.  Our server was fantastic.  Super efficient, really friendly, but not over the top.  We were seated at the same time as another group of friends, and we were done a good 15 minutes before them.  No, we didn't eat any faster, we just had better service.    Don't forget your Total Rewards card. You get $1 off each menu item just for being a member.  Not bad."}
{"text":"I think i came in here with way too high expectations.  Food:           FarmBrown burger - my husband ordered this and he liked it so much that he ordered another one. He said that it does not taste like any burger he ever ate. I tasted it too (i dont like the taste of beef btw) and he was right. It tasted differently. And not beefy taste. (+2*)           My order: fish and crisp sandwich - considering that I'm a pescatarian, this was my only option. Plus, i visited England and i really missed the traditional fish and chips which it's so hard to find in the US. To get to the point, disappointing! There was too much batter, not nearly enough tart sauce, and that bread was ridiculous! I couldn't eat that as a sandwich. I ate it with a knife and fork. ( -1*)           Extras: truffle cheese fries and sweet potato fires. These were delicious !!! ( +1*) Service:                Waiter:                       Garret - very good and polite.                Hostess: quick and polite.        ( +1*)"}
{"text":"BurGR was one of the best meals we had in vegas. If you like burgers, (and you should) you gotta stop here!  Put your name in and they'll text your phone when your table is ready so you have time to peruse around the casino and check out the shops at Planet Hollywood.   There were five of us and we all ordered the farm burger or the Hell's Kitchen burger and both were some of the best burgers I've ever had! We also split the jalapeño poppers  and way too many amazing truffle fries. 3 orders is way more than enough for 5 people!   The service was  as outstanding as the atmosphere and I'll tell everyone I know going to vegas to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Britannia burger was excellent, Chipolte ketchup and Parmesean ranch dip great"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, since it was 9:30 on a Friday night and  I didn't want to stand behind the velvet rope to get a table for one. (Seriously. Do they think this is a club line at Caesar's?)  The bartender was very interested in serving me until I said \"I'll just have a water until I order my burger.\" Sorry no big bar tab here.  Then he didn't acknowledge me for 15 minutes (which took some doing, since he was no more than 10 feet from me at any time). After trying to get his attention 2 or 3 times, I finally flagged down the other bartender to order my farm burger and fries.   Then I started watching the Heat game on TV.   20 minutes later the first bartender finally made eye contact.  \"Hey, let me check on your burger.\"  He comes back and sheepishly says, \"it should be coming soon, but can I bribe you with a beer in the meantime?\" Sorry, I don't drink but at least he finally gave a damn.   The burger came and it was juicy and delicious. Not the best burger I've ever had, but a quality burger. Four stars for the burger alone.   I didn't like the fries at all. THey weren't really crispy but at least they weren't soggy or greasy either. Just like cubes of softened potatoes.   I planned to order a milkshake for dessert, but I just wanted out at that point. And I had already hogged a seat at the bar for almost an hour (through no real fault of my own, but still...)  Anyway...fine...I get it...my tab was going to be $25 bucks instead of $50. Maybe it was all an honest mistake...who knows.   But in the end, the burger was decent, the fries weren't great, and the bartender treated me like I was a homeless guy (despite the fact that I never said ONE word of protest or snarkiness)"}
{"text":"This burger is some of the most freaking delicious I've had. The burgers are so juicy that the flavor just oozes out in your mouth. Gordon Ramsay has the right to yell at other lesser chefs; Burgr proves it."}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic.  We started off with the jalapeno poppers, sweet potato fries, and the truffle fries for appetizers. The dips for the fries were delicious! I really liked the vanilla powdered sugar on the sweet potato fries because the sugary sweetness was such a unique addition to FRIES. The poppers came nicely plated in these shot-glass dishes and were tasty as well.  My friend and I exchanged the halves of two burgers so we could try more variety. I had both the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Farm Burger. The patties were cooked to a lovely medium rare, the buns were fresh, and the individual ingredients for both burgers blended together nicely. In my opinion, I liked the Hell's Kitchen Burger slightly better though because of its lighter and more refreshing flavor. Don't get me wrong, the Farm Burger was great in its own way. You can really taste the duck bacon along with the savory egg and cheddar combo.  The service was very attentive and er.. pretty attractive in its own way haha  If I ever come back to Las Vegas (hopefully soon!), I'm totally coming back!"}
{"text":"Our group of 8 came here upon recommendation and decided that an hour wait on a Friday night will not deter us.  Everyone in my group except for me ordered a burger and I heard no complaints.  I can't remember each name because there are too many but the sizes were decent (for us girls).  I am the only one that decided to have a salad and was disappointed.  My salad name escapes me but it had cold noodles in it which I did not enjoy but thats what I get for trying to be healthy. I also tried the truffle fries and they were pretty darn good. I also had a drink called Skinny Minnie (I think)  and it was great."}
{"text":"I had the truffle burger and it was out of this world!  It was like sunshine in your mouth amazing! The  gooey fries are not gooey at all with cheese and the plain fries are horrifically bland and boring! Gordon, time to do a spot check because they lacked even salt !  Shame on them for even serving them! Service was pleasant but extremely slow!   I think if Gordon had been in the house there would have been some shouting! Lol"}
{"text":"Let me say that, first off, the service here was pretty sweet. The hostess was super nice about letting us split up our group of 12 into two groups of 6. And our waitress was very patient, explaining everything to us since it was our first time at the restaurant, down to what each burger is made out of and being totally okay with us splitting the bill 3 ways (I LOVE it when a server has no issue with bill splitting).  Prices really aren't too horrible, compared to other Vegas locales. I paid under $50 (including tip) for two burgers and truffle fries. The Farm Burger (done medium rare) was very juicy and flavorful. It went down very easy (the fried egg is SUCH a nice addition to any burger in my humble opinion), but I also wouldn't say that I was totally blown away by it. The truffle fries were good, too, but the aioli wasn't as truffle-y as I wish it could have been.  Boyfriend and I were originally going to just split the Farm Burger, but we were still kind of hungry (it had looked bigger while we were scoping it out at a neighboring table), so we ordered a Brittania Burger at the last second. Our food had come out pretty quickly, so we had expected this burger to come through pretty fast, too.  Alas, it wasn't the case. It took them over 20 minutes to bring the second burger to us, so we asked them to box it up for us so we could take it with us back to our hotel room because we didn't want to keep holding up our party. We did eat it as soon as we got back, though. The mango chutney is what makes this burger, I think. It was a nice sweetness that cut through the savory of the burger, if that makes sense. I enjoyed this one more than the Farm Burger.  Overall, it was pretty good, but I like Umami's Truffle Burger more. I would eat here again (the pricing is essentially on par with normal Strip pricing) and I would try a milkshake this time, too, but I wouldn't say it's something that I would tell people they HAD to get whenever they were in town."}
{"text":"Honestly the best burger I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly and basically anything that has goat cheese in it becomes a favorite of mine. Also got a spicy drink that was really flavorful and delicious. The waiter was nice and attentive. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"Farm Burger with duck breast bacon + english sharp cheddar + topped with a fried egg, Truffle Parmesan Fries & a Caramel Pudding Chocolate Shake which was the absolute ICING ON THE CAKE. By far the best damn Milk Shake I've ever had in my entire life. Yes, the food was great but I f'd up & ruined my appetite sucking down that damn crack-infused milkshake before my burger arrived. I'm STILL having withdrawals... Can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and honestly never had a better burger. Completwly amazing food here.  Definetly go here if you get the chance."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great burgers.... It is quite a wait to get in the restaurant but the food and drinks do not disappoint...! They are 'fresh' burgers so you can order them the temperature you want them.... I like medium rare but there medium is also very good! Buns are excellent and condiments are housemade including the ketchup...! If you get an appetizer make sure you try the poppers... Also the truffle fries are to-die-for....! This place is a must every time we are in Las Vegas...!"}
{"text":"The service was sub par at best! They served water in a glass that ended up breaking, spilling over the table as well as on the people on the table; resulting in wet pants for the rest of the night! Worse was the fact that they did nothing about their error, truly not worth your time! Also, the burger does not include fries, although servers at this establishment may word the order as though it is included."}
{"text":"see... here's the thing.  I came here strictly because of being a Gordon Ramsay fanboi.  There's no way I would wait in line for an hour to get a burger.  After an hour and 15 minutes of waiting we were finally seated after being quoted an hour.  We ordered the Farm burger, the Chili Cheese dog, and the parm truffle fries. The burger was good. The bun was very good.  The duck bacon is different for sure as we were warned by the server.  The chili cheese dog was disappointing but the fries were delicious.  Ask for the white cheddar ranch sauce to accompany the fries and you wont be disappointed.    All in all I wont dine here again if the wait is over 20 minutes, but the burger was delicious."}
{"text":"Holy hell this place was awesome. New(er) burger place in Planet Hollywood and I'm glad I found it. I ordered the Britainna burger (or however they spell it) and it was awesome. Very juicy and it had a sweet flavor which I loved. The sweet potato fries were also really good and I liked the vanilla powder they give you to sprinkle on them (just do it, it is amazing). They even make their own ketchup which they call ye signature curry ketchup. I wish I could buy that stuff by the bottle. The place was a bit pricey but you've got to expect that in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'd have to give this place 5 stars. The service was amazing and the FOOD was amazing! We started with the Jalepeño poppers. Since I am a fanatic of jalepeño poppers this was a great choice. The flavor was bursting in each popper. Best choice for a starter. Next, I had the Euro Burger. This is a must if you like goat cheese. Never have I ever thought of mixing goat cheese in a burger. It was the most delicious! Lastly, finish your meal with an oreo shake. All the food was to die for and if you are a burger enthusiast like I am... you probably wouldn't want to have another burger ever, unless it was from here!"}
{"text":"The wings and jalapeño poppers are very good. I love the sauce the jalapeño poppers come with. It's like a tangy ranch like saucy. I can't really distinguish what it is actually.  If you have a total rewards card you save about $1 per item, which adds up to a nice savings. The service is fast for appetizers it is the burgers they make you wait on."}
{"text":"We wouldn't go back! The food was overly priced and not very good at all! We ordered the hog burger and the fish sandwich fries and onion rings with 2 beers and it was 75 dollars! Ridiculous! Unless u have a fancy palate don't go here go to steak by Gordon Ramsey and get a good meal. The stars were for the waitress she was great"}
{"text":"Here we go.  Just walked in and the hostesses welcomed us by giving us a dirty look and having a very poor attitude towards us. Extremely unwelcoming. I hope the food makes up for the terrible service from the hostesses. Maybe Gordon Ramsay just got done screaming at them. Or he just really needs to ;)  Okay our server is very nice. He's been courteous and helpful in making suggestions. I think Ramsay needs to have a little chat with the hostesses.   The food is amazing. Hells Kitchen burger is THE bomb. The juicy patty goes so well with avocado and the tomatoes and jalapeño to add just the right amount of kick and flavor without overdoing it. The truffle fries are pretty good as well! The aioli dipping sauce is delicious with about everything :) they also have a good beer menu. Deff check this place out!"}
{"text":"I think it was a good burger, but as is the case for all restaurants in LV, way overpriced. Given all the new burger places popping up around the country, its just not worth it. Shake Shack is better, cheaper, and more fun. But when in Vegas, you have little choice. Service was quick and pleasant."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to planet Hollywood and I happened to pass by Gordon Ramsey burger restaurant BURGR. I  am a major fan of Gordon Ramsey because of the passion he has for food and have admired his genius approach to food from his major tv shows like Hell's Kitchen and home cooking show on YouTube. I was excited to try his creations for the first time and I was not disappointed.   The menu at BURGR was short but appetizing. The prices was fair ranging from $14-$20 dishes with a varieties to choose from. I tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger cooked medium with everything the burger described on paper. The meat on the burger had a savoriness that was beautifully sandwiched between soft poppyseed bun. This burger was uniquely spiced with a heat that only tickled my tongue because of my tolerance for spicy foods. The burger was perfectly seasoned and shared a wonderful sweetness with roasted red tomatoes that tasted like it was roasted in house. The spiciness of the burger was smartly balanced by the addition of avocado which created a cooling and creamy effect that make u want to go back for more. Don't get me wrong, this burger is spicy and packed a punch that got my girlfriend going back and back for sips of water. However the burger was interesting, unique, addictive, satisfying, fun, and delicious. A must try burger that promise to leave the palate wonder why it has wasted all it time tasting fast foods."}
{"text":"Knowing Gordon Ramsay's expectation's on Hell's Kitchen, I knew this restaurant had to be amazing....and it was! Everything had such a wonderful flavor. I had the earth burger which was a portobello mushroom burger, and my husband had the fish and crisps. We also shared the Parmesan truffle fries. I have had truffle oil from the grocery store and couldn't stand the flavor. I have heard that real truffle oil tastes completely different. It does! These fries were delicious and they make their own ketchup and give you a homemade truffle aioli sauce as well. Both were extremely good. Service was great as well! Would definitely return and encourage others to go."}
{"text":"I told Jacqueline R.  that I would go try this place.  And I finally did!  To clarify, this one is not the Gordon Ramsey burger joint over at Planet Hollywood with 20 different choices.  This one only has four burger/ sandwiches in the category.  We were confused after 45 minutes of walk on the strip.  Tired, hungry... And found out that the place was fully booked for the night and the receptionist had stopped taking reservations!  She saw the devastation on our faces and immediately said, \"you can always sit at the bar!\"  So we did.  Interior design-- spacious, modern, British simplicity and elegance. There are about 200 Beer kegs on one side of the wall indicating a wide selection of brews available at the bar.  Staff-- cool, friendly, knowledgable. I couldn't help asking about the uniform-- black & white short sleeve collared jersey with printed houndstooth design, skinny jeans in pumpkin spice color.  It takes some guts to put on these very bold outfit everyday, guys!  Well, they hate it.  But the irrelevant colors attract attention for sure.    Well, I took the bartender's recommendation and ordered the lamb burger.  This item was AMAZING.  The bun was unbelievably soft.  The goat cheese and lamb dissolved on my tongue and went down like a fast train.  I usually hesitate with the combo of lamb and goat cheese because the smell could be easily overwhelming.  The ingredient used here were apparently superior.  There was no scent of lamb or goat for my anxiety.  A very successful dish!  And I loved the fries too.  Drink-- \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" Champaign, berry juice, vodka, 2 big blue berries on top with a twist of orange peel.  Bubbly and fruity,  it was delightful.  I'm glad I came here.  I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Dear Gordon,  Thank you for opening this delicious burger joint.  As usual, the service was excellent.  Our server was attentive and very friendly, too.  I also had the pleasure of sampling some appetizers and let me just tell you, you make the best jalapeno poppers I've ever had in my life.  The truffle fries are excellent as well! Of course, the burger was perfect and cooked to perfection. The meat was well seasoned and the temp was spot on.   Additionally, for a burger joint, the hot dog is pretty darn good.  It's actually my parent's favorite thing to order.   Thank you again for an absolutely wonderful dining experience.    Best, Lauren S. Yelp, Long Island  P.S. for everyone who thinks I'm crazy, I know this letter isn't really going to Gordon.  It's called - having a little fun here and there."}
{"text":"Man~ I was so hungry when we came here to eat. We've been eating burgers our entire stay at Vegas, Gordon Ramsay was our last stop before heading home. Both my boyfriend and I were pretty hyped because our family recommend it and heck... It's fricken Ramsay we're talking about here  We ordered sweet potato fries and the wings for appetizers. The wings were good and the fries were amazing!  Then comes out $15 burgers! I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger my BF got some pork one. They look so yum.. Then I took a bite... The second bite.... And a third... And man, how many bites is it going to take to make this burger taste good? By the time I got half way I felt disappointed. The burger wasn't bad per say.. It was just lacking. I think the burger needs a sauce that will give it more of a kick to it. I was expecting something spicy with the richness of the avocados but that wasn't there.  In the end our experience at this place wasn't bad but it did ended our trip with a disappointing good bye Las Vegas meal ):"}
{"text":"My brothers wifes parents and aunt from Philippines were visiting and wanted to come to this famous chefs spot would be good for the overseas family. They asked me and my cousin to come meet them for dinner and seeing I had a positive experience, I gave it another go.   I had the chanterelle burger and simply fries. It was the same consistency as last - it was cooked to a nice pink and juicy, the mushrooms and jams were nice with it. Maybe I've been drawn to more simple burgers on this menu but it generally is so topping fiends may be disappointed on that front? It's a clean beef flavor with a big of enhancement is I think what they're going for.  I also tried some of my brothers truffle fries which was rather good, with a great aioli and the onion rings my cousin got were decent, but I feel the truffle fries are the best bet side. My brother also got jalapeno poppers and those were good as far as poppers go.  Service was friendly, but just ok on the attentive front. It was during peak dinner hours and it was SOO BUSY and they were just a bit spread thin so I wont fault too much. There was a wait, and while these burgers were good I feel the wait will dampen the experience. I recommend not off hours.    My one thing we thought sucked though was when I came with the BF last they split our shake no problem and we were told you cant split them. It lead to fights with the two kids having to share one cup. I was a bit perplexed as to why they wouldn't split because it is \"too thick\".   Now the BF meets us after he gets off work and he wanted to eat here too since we were already here. Haha. SOO I went again with him.   He got a fish sandwich and said that was good, but not better than a burger. He got the sweet potato fries which had this kicker jalapeno dip so there was a sweet/spicy/salty thing going on with this.    I sat there with one of their shakes and got the strawberry with coconut pudding. The BF got a oreo with creme brulee pudding. Good, rich but overkill at least for us. We should've shared one like last time  Water went empty a few times, but it wasn't as busy. Still very personable and friendly though and did check on us and kinda chatted but didn't look down and see our water was low and started to walk away until we asked for some. We asked for our food to be packed and it wasnt and then we asked again and it as taken and while signing and doing their little iphone survey it didn't get to our table and we then forgot about it.   Overall - after technically three visits, I think it's a solid place for a spot on the strip. I don't think the price point is bad given location, but as a local I wouldn't make a habit of it. And definitely - not during peak hours! It's worth the trip down, but not waiting an hour each visit. I'll keep it at a solid 4 stars since I'm a fan, but I'll say the experiences teeter between 3-4 depending."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It is a great place to be dressed up or casual. The burgers are amazing. I got the Truffle burger and it was delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything truffle. My brother and uncle Hell's Kitchen burger and loved it as well. We all decided to share sweet potato fries. The burgers are huge so sharing a side was a great choice.   The service was wonderful too. Very quick and attentive. This is the second time I've eaten at GurGR and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 5 and waited about 25 min on a Monday at 1pm. The service was prompt and attentive. I tried the truffle fries, onion rings, Hell's Kitchen burger and Farm burger. Maybe it was overhyped but I felt like you're paying more for the \"name\" rather than the food. Everything tasted fine, but nothing stood out that confirmed the large number of raving reviews.

{"text":"After having missed visiting Burgr the last time we were in Vegas, we finally made it this time! I was slightly apprehensive and thought I had hyped the place a bit too much in my head. I was pleasantly surprised! Husband and I both ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and replaced the meat with chicken. Usually the chicken patty is quite flavorless and dry, this one was juicy, full of flavor and tasted delicious!   The truffle fries were also pretty good. Very satisfying experience!"}
{"text":"Loved the design of the place and the Farm Burger I had was awesome.  Service was great and a lot of different and creative burgers (something I would expect from a gourmet Chef)."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I try and eat here every time I visit Las Vegas. The burgers are delicious, but my favorite food at this place are the jalapeño poppers. The wait time is lengthy, but what do you expect?? It's worth it, and you can wander around the casino while you wait for your table to be ready. It's crowded, but I don't mind. I have had great customer service every time I have been here. Mary Ann was our waitress, and she was really friendly and social."}
{"text":"Wow I was on vacation in Vegas and tried to go for lunch on Tuesday August 27th & was told it was a 50 to 60 minute wait. So no big deal I decided to go for dinner instead of waiting and I was shocked when the hostess walking down the line says to me- if you don't want to wait 50 minutes for lunch, I would not suggest coming back for dinner!! Wow what kind of hostess says that to potential and new customers?? I will not return.  That was rude and she scared away a great customer.  I have eaten at all gordon ramsay restaurants and never experienced that.  What a shame I hope someone else will bring it to their attention if this happens ."}
{"text":"It seems every time I go to Las Vegas my inner fat girl comes out. After walking a million miles I saw this restaurant and HAD to have a burger. There was a long line to get in but was able to get in right away with a VIP card. Service wasn't bad for as busy as the place was.   So many choices but I opted for the uber cheeseburger which I ordered medium, this burger was perfect for any burger cravings I had. My mouth still waters thinking of this burger and I can't wait to go back and try another item on the menu. The uber cheese burger has 4 different cheeses: asadero cheese + fontina cheese+boursin cheese + vintage white cheddar...almost like having a grilled cheese on top of a burger!  Warning: It is very large and you may want to share with someone!"}
{"text":"The burger was fair, once it arrived a half hour later than my girlfriend's.... Bartender/waiter was good, he wrote it down, not sure where it got messed up, for this type of place I would have expected much better. I'll stick with stripburger.... My fault for trying something new. They comped it only on request"}
{"text":"I hope you're happy now Gordon Ramsey. I've completed the trifecta of being to all 3 of your incarnations in Las Vegas now. BurGR is located inside Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino. Those of you who have read my PH reviews will know unless you're staying at this hotel or very near walking distance-wise, it's not the greatest spot in terms of ease of accessibility. I will note this is the first good valet experience even if it is on the third try. The decor seemed trendy & chic yet it still felt casual. I found the place thanks to two large screen TV's bearing the restaurant's name & emblem. There were also numerous TV's throughout the place showing various sporting events. Place was crazy packed, wait time was 45min-1hr! Fortunately my sister and I didn't have to wait. I did ask the hostess if this was a normal lunch hour and she said yes, it's like this pretty much all day except for a few hours between lunch & dinner. That's pretty long to wait but on the other hand it's probably a good sign if it's always that busy. Reservations are recommended. We came for Restaurant Week but it didn't stop my sister from sampling the Gin Green Tea and from I trying shake #3. Banana shake with top 1/3 being butterscotch pudding and a dollop of whipped cream to top it all off. Pretty rich and creamy, big chunks of banana still floating through the thickness of the shake. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger(asadero cheese, jalapenos, avocado & tomato) & she had the Euro burger(truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula & tomato). We also had an order of the truffle fries w/ house made ketchup & truffle aioli and the beer battered sweet maui onion rings w/ chipotle ketchup & cheddar ranch. Not to mention the sticky toffee pudding push pops to finish the meal. It was all so good but I was ready to fall over from being so full at the end. Our waitress was very nice & attentive. There was a few close water refill 'emergencies' but it didn't last long LOL. She told us the menus, which were double folded with a round cutout at the bottom center so it would stand up and accomodate the napkin/utensil wrap through it, could be taken for souvenirs if we so chose. Same for the expended plastic push pops(dunno if it matters but my sister noticed were made in Italy). For $20 Restaurant Week it was a great deal since the burger & fries were already around $25, then the dessert to boot. Out of the 3 GR spots I'd probably choose this place to dine at more often if I HAD to go again hehe. It's just more my style, but that's just me. Not to say anything was really bad at his other two places aside from the prices. I give this place a solid 4.5 stars but gave it the benefit and bumped it to 5 since theres no half-star option. Can't really penalize Ramsey for PH having such bad accessibilty."}
{"text":"It's in a crowded area. You have to wait around 45 minutes for a table. Lots of obnoxious and drunk tourists everywhere. Tons of cheesy decor.  But none of that matters, because The Farm Burger here at Burgr is the best damn burger you will ever eat in your life."}
{"text":"Best burger ever!! For me and my husband that are burger taster jaja !  The top 3 hamburgers !!!  First the attention www amazing  I order de truffles burger   and my husband the one that they recommend the hog burger ! Both were excellent !! For us the most important thing is the bread and was perfect bread !!! The size ! Flavor !! Wow everything amazing !! I recommend to order one fries for two people ! The onion ring were spectacular perfect taste and crunch !!!   Love this place"}
{"text":"This place was ok. The burger was cooked very well and did taste pretty good, but their ketchup sucks. I guess they make their own ketchup which is cool but it wasn't to my liking. The service isn't that good. The waiters and waitresses take a long time. Overall, I wouldn't come back to this place. The ketchup was a deal breaker for me and the service was pretty crappy."}
{"text":"Get the Britannia Burger - something different and delicious that I have never tasted before. A mix of salty and sweet that I often crave, so satisfying, I was disappointed there wasn't more. The Hell's Kitchen Burger on the other hand was a HUGE disappointment. Minimal to no sauce, no heat at all, and there was nothing special to the burger at all. It was as if they had forgotten the pesto aioli. Other than the Hell's Kitchen Burger, rated 3/5 because both burgers were a bit over salted in certain bites, and although we ordered our burgers medium - one was medium rare and the other medium well. Take out also took FOREVER and they failed to provide utensil or even napkins."}
{"text":"This place was actually better than I expected.  You should expect a long line to get in, or if you are lucky you can grab a seat at one of the bars inside.  I had a Euro burger, which I thought was great and plenty filling.  I skipped the fries and all the other bad stuff though, but they looked like they would have tasted good.  The service was good, but expect to wait a little bit for your food to come out.  Luckily they have a good drink/beer list to try from."}
{"text":"Thanks to my Bestie who was dying to this place out we chose to make this our Grand Finale. Now I'm your average In-N-Out loving girl who lives on the East Coast so I try to slide pass there when town but this time i held off for this place instead. From the Burgers, to the beer, on to the truffle fries, right on down to the onion rings everything was beyond finger licking good. Paul was as helpful as a server could get with recommendations and it led to everyone at our table being full and happy. BurGR is one of my new favorite Vegas spots and beyond met my expectations."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst experiences at this place. We had to wait 15 minutes after being seated for a worker to ask us what we wanted. When I asked for a bun without seeds was told they can't do that and they don't have much on the menu that can't be served with seeds. I ended up being shown a Caesars salad that was not much better than McDonald's. My wife asked for the noodle salad with no sauce and was told they can't serve it like that but they could put it on the side. To top it off this was my mother-in-law and father-in-law's first time in Vegas. We also had to wait about 40 minutes for our 2 salads and 2 burgers. When we got them we were very dissatisfied and they smothered my wife's salad with the hot sauce on it. She could not eat it. The worker offered to make her something else but over an hour had passed and we had to get to a show so we paid the bill and left. This is a disgrace to Gordon Ramsey. I would skip this place."}
{"text":"Solid place for food or after hours food. Great hamburger cooked perfectly. Service was good and the place was busy and fun.  I had a cheeseburger with bacon and fries that were great."}
{"text":"Great service. Get the hot dog that's all I'm going to say. It is amazing. The burgers are good. But seriously get the hot dog!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure if is part of the motif or that every single person on staff literally hates their job and their life. I took my mother here for her birthday and it was bad. She ordered the pastrami sandwich. When she ordered it it was not clear that it had and actual hamburger patty on top of the sandwich. She said she misunderstood and had to argue with the server then the manager. He then brought over the menu to claim it was clearly listed. When he brought it over he noticed it was no where to be seen. The food was mediocre and low quality. I would think twice about visiting this place."}
{"text":"Ate here Sat/14 Mar approx 8 pm with some friends: - About a 40 min wait to seat the 5 of us, which is reasonable on the Strip on a Saturday night. - Service and decor is good. - Food was bad in my case.  First burger they brought me had a hair in it.  They replaced it with a second burger which was too cooked for my taste (I ordered rare). - I had a coupla bites of the first burger and the same of the second burger.  At least they didn't charge me for the food. - I prefer Gordon Ramsey's Pub inside Caesars."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing experience dining here for my vegas trip, definitely one of the top favorites for dining during my trip.   One downer was when we asked the hostess how long the wait would be for a table, she told us it would be 15-20 minutes. But we actually didn't get seated until 35-40 minutes of waiting...   But the food here is amazing, almost everything is made in house and I was extremely impressed by the extra effort they put into the food to make it amazing.   We started with onion rings for an appetizer, and the onion rings was so good. It was perfectly cooked and the sauces to dip made it even more amazing. I got the hell's kitchen burger and it was so good, I did wish there were more jalapeños but they gave me so much avocado in my burger so I guess that evens it out. My boyfriend got the hog burger and he loved it, it's a pork burger and it was cooked very well and he liked it but he did say he preferred a regular burger over the pork burger. We also ordered French fries but they were quite large. They were more like chips than French fries in my opinion, and we prefer smaller crispy fries.   Also got shake #4 togo and it was very good, creme Brule pudding with an oreo shake and cookie, one of the best shakes I've ever had. Everything was great, and our server was amazing. Only down side was the wait time quote."}
{"text":"I have been here twice! The Farm Burgr is amazing. The egg and the burgr are cooked to perfection! It is just delicious. Also, their service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My friend is obsessed with Gordon Ramsay so on our last Vegas trip, we had to stop by before we left for home. We didn't have to wait too long before we were seated. They use an iPad to display their drink menu which is cool. My friends and I ordered an Oreo milkshake which was amazing! A huge glass is filled 3/4 with Oreo milkshake, then the top 1/4 is filled with creme brulee pudding and finally, it's garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and an Oreo cookie. YUM!! It was so delicious but also super filling - my friends and I were full after 3 sips. As for the burgers, we ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, euro burger, and the farm burger. We also ordered a side of truffle parmesan fries. All of the burgers were juicy and delicious and the fries were perfect as well. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"The hostesses were frosty and rude and did not smile once in the hour we were there. They were pretty unpleasant to deal with to be honest. Otherwise the food was excellent. The truffle fries were to die for!  The restaurant is cramped and like any Vegas success, it is REALLY busy. Too busy.  I enjoyed the food, but I didn't enjoy being there."}
{"text":"If you have to be gluten free like me, suggest bringing your own hamburger bun. I was under the impression they had gluten free buns but they didn't. I didn't want to pay $15 or so for a patty on a plate I got a salad. Thought about it and should have asked if I could get a burger wrap. I guess it's an excuse to get more creative with my food!"}
{"text":"Coming from a place filled with gourmet burgers I definitely set my bar higher for a gourmet and 14 dollar burger.  If I wasn't from LA, this place would've definitely gotten 4 stars or higher.  My farm burger was ehhhh okay, good but not worth 14 dollars but my husband definitely enjoyed his Hell's Kitchen burger! It's spicy but he loved it! So if I had to return, I guess I'll try Hell's Kitchen burger instead."}
{"text":"All I have to say is  Freshly made ketchup with the Parmesan fries  Euro Burger was ridiculously good.  I have to shout out the Ketchup again."}
{"text":"Burger was really good.  So were the poppers.  Not a fan of the fries, and really do not like that they make you wait in line to get a seat.  Why cant i just get a pager like everyone else so i can gamble while i wait?"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, no complaints. The barkeep was attentive! Food came out quick! The truffle fries were amazing, the ketchup taste more like marinara sauce but it was good, the truffle dip was really great! Got the lamb burger it was exactly as described!"}
{"text":"Never knew a burger could taste this good.  I went there for lunch alone and got seated at the bar ~5 mins later. Ordered a truffle burgr on medium. The patty is sooo perfect! Juicy, smoky, crunchy, ... The bun is also very delicious. omg Im falling in love!  Stole some truffle fries from the person sitting next to me, they are very tasty with/without the dipping (the white dipping is the best!)  (Disclaimer, this is he first time I heard about Gordon Ramsay so I am not biased in anyway)"}
{"text":"The Hells Kitchen Burger was very tasty. You could taste the spice but not too overwhelming. Sweet potato fries and onion rings were delicious. Come with a small group of friends or family to enjoy the different style of fries that they have to offer."}
{"text":"Not a build your own disaster place.  No teriyaki or yakisoba garnish.  BurGR is not about reinvention but about creating the every day burger on steroids and what a great burger it is.  Take a flavorful, plump, juicy, fire grilled burger put it in a good brioche bun, top it with greens (arugula instead of lettuce), cheese (fresh European instead of Kraft singles), onions (as jam), tomato (oven roasted) sautéed mushrooms (chanterelles); you get the picture.  The chanterelle burger is delicious. Pungent chanterelles, spicy arugula, and the onion jam compliment the char flavor of the beef.  The Euro burger equally good.  Earthy truffle aioli, tart goat cheese, peppery arugula, and sweet oven roasted tomato.  As with the chanterelle burger, the toppings bring out the flavor of the beef.  The two meat burgers are creative and delicious.  Props to the farm burger with its slightly gamy duck breast \"bacon\", sharp English cheddar and fried egg.  A great interpretation of the Midwest classic.  Ooey, gooey, juicy and messy.  Delicious.  For sides, parm truffle fries.  Nuff said.  Somewhat inconsistent service and probably the reason for the burgers arriving over temperature.  Tip: use your Total Rewards card to get a minuscule discount (don't bother getting a card if you don't have one).  Never thought I'd see the day when a British chef honored our humble burger.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Tastiest burgers on the strip! Clearly GR knows what he is doing when designing a menu, but this surpasses any other burger I've had. Great and attentive staff, quick service and all the quality.  Started with the parm fries with fresh made ketchup- so flavorful!  I had the mushroom burger.  Great taste, cooked perfectly.  Try the margaritas. .. so refreshing and delicious! ****check in at hostess stand to be added to wait list and get a text alert when your table is ready!*****"}
{"text":"I had the Euro burger with Sweet Potato Fries and a Oreo Shake. The burger was amazing, the fries were great, and the Oreo shake, although way to thick and filling was spectacular. Service was excellent and very knowledgeable. Would definitely recommend and will go back."}
{"text":"Great place. Burger's are tremendous. The burgers are huge and juicy. They do not take reservations. So if you don't get there early, there will be a wait. The steak fries are also top of the line. Before going here, it thought it would be way too commercialized I with Gordon Ramsay and the food would just be subpar, but boy was I wrong. Tremendous food."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, I ordered the earth burger which is one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. Don't under estimate the sweet potato fries because their definitely sweet. Topped with powdered sugar with a side of an icing type of sauce! Parmesan fries are great also!  We also had one of their shakes which was absolutely delicious. The food took a little long (about 30 minutes) but besides the wait we had a great experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok...the burger was nothing to write home about. It had no flavor and was 15.00. The truffle fries were tasteless and 11.00. I would have sent it back but I didnt want Boogers n come in my food..for those who watch south park, you get it."}
{"text":"I would NEVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN!  I would recommend going to the Earl of Sandwich (located in the same casino) instead.  We stumble across the restaurant in Planet Hollywood and thought with Ramsay reputation at least the food should be amazing.   TERRIBLE SERVICE:   When we first arrived they take you number and text you a wait time, kind of nice, except it was 30 minutes off.  After waiting 30 minutes longer than they estimated our buzzer goes off to get seated they say, but really it was to wait in another line of people whose buzzers have gone off.  In this line they pulled parties that came after us, to go ahead of us.  Then we are finally seated over an hour later.  To wait another 10 minutes to even see a waiter, who then does not bring us the water we ordered.  It took another 15 minutes to get our water from a bus boy.  It was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had.    SUB PAR FOOD: At least the food we ordered should be good, NOT.  The food was ok at best.  My boyfriend didn't even finish half of his Hell's Kitchen Burger it was so bad and my Farmer's Burger was only decent.  They also charge $8 just for regular fries on the side!!!  I read other reviews with the same complaints so DON\"T BE FOOLED.  It was the worst meal and experience we had during our Vegas trip."}
{"text":"Like a lot of things in Vegas, this place is all fluff and hype and not much substance. First of all, it took 17 minutes from the time we were seated to get a beer and soda. This is mainly because we had to wait for the drink menu on an I-Pad that was being used by another table, \"really\" ? Cute idea, maybe. Really bad business decision. The chicken sliders were absolutely terrible. I tried to cover the taste up with some of the provided sauces, it only made it worse. I had my wife try a bite and she couldn't believe I was even trying to eat it. The burger was good, not great. The onion rings looked great but actually were bland and just OK. We come to Vegas twice a year for the past 25 years. There are so many better choices for burgers or a good meal."}
{"text":"I was super excited to eat here since I'm a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay!!! I wasn't disappointed with the Euro Burger I got and my husband loved the Hell's Kitchen Burger. The bread was super light and crunchy, which is very rare for me to see in other burger places I've been to. The staff is great!!!! Watching them work and deliver quality food was amazing. The sweet potato fries were too sweet for my taste buds, but I'm giving this place 5 stars anyway for the great food and experience."}
{"text":"This place is a . .. fair ... burger place.  Not awesome and not worth the hype or prices.  I love Ramsay's other places; but this place is only . . . fair."}
{"text":"Even though the last time I ate at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr was almost 3 years ago I still drool whenever I think about the burger I had.... and so I decided a review is never too late. Vegas is all about buffets, but once in a while you need to take a break, and when you do, you should come here!   I had the Hell's Kitchen burger, one which was recommended as one of their most popular burgers. Yes it is quite pricy at $15 American, it doesn't come with any sides AND is pretty small...... but a burger that good can get by with that price. Biting into the Hell's Kitchen burger made me fall in love with food even more. The amount of flavour made me want to order another one to go, just so I could enjoy it again....in a few hours.   Looking at the menu now, I can't say there are any burgers that I wouldn't want to try. Truffle burger with foie gras??? *hardcore drooling* Next trip to Vegas, I'm preparing for a week of burgers only!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The line was long but we got a seat at the bar after about a half hour. The bartenders were very friendly. The food was delicious! My favorite part of the whole thing were the buns. It was fresh & light bread. Everything we got from a appetizer to the milkshakes were delicious! Pricey but it's Gordon Ramsey so of course. The people in the back did mess up our order twice, but the bartenders were very apologetic & got it fixed right away."}
{"text":"I kinda expected more but overall the food was good. Maybe next time I will ask that my burger be cooked a little longer...there was a little too much moo for me. Lol. However, the creme brûlée milkshake made me forget all about my burger. :)"}
{"text":"First try and Gordans spot in planet hollywood. there was a line however we bypass the line somehow and get seated right away. Great customer service and food came out pretty quick. try the jalapeno poppers, and milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Real good farm burger (duck breast bacon with sharp cheddar cheese and fried egg), even better truffle fries (sprinkled with Parmesan cheese), and especially the mayo was delicious!    The only odd thing whew the extremely low chairs. I guess they really don't want you to get up once you sit down.   Wait was about 30 minutes on Wednesday night. You can't make a reservation. It's first come, first serve. They take your name (I used Mike Pancake) and phone number, so you can go gamble I guess, and text you once your table is ready. Overall real good dining experience worth the money."}
{"text":"MAKE RESERVATIONS FIRST. That's the best advice I can give. The food here is phenomenal, the staff is very educated on the menu and delivers exceptional service and the food is absolutely amazing. You can make reservations and then wander around Planet Hollywood for a bit, then walk back up and get a table. Once you're inside, the service doesn't take too long at all, it's just a matter of getting a table. I will definitely go back here next time I'm in Vegas. Make sure to try the fries for sure!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Vegas for sure! Great staff and great beer selection! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is a must try! The service and excellent and along with the food. They help you order based on what you like. It was crowded so we ordered the Oreo creme brûlée shake while we wait. When I took a sip of this, it was like heaven in my mouth. The Oreo and creme brûlée part are divided top and bottom. The Oreo part was very creamy and chocolaty, the cream brûlée part was also very creamy and rich. It was one of the best shakes and dessert I've ever had!   Our fries came out second and we ordered the truffle fries. They are very crisps and salty from the parmesan. We had 2 burgers and asked for them to cut each in half so we could try each other's. I forgot what they were called but one had an over easy egg in it and the other had some peppers in it along with bacon. The meat was cooked to perfection with it still having a little bit of pink inside. Overall it was a great experience and I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Everything looked delicious but when I tasted the food I was so disappointed. I got the uber cheeseburger, truffle parmesan fries and onion rings. I ordered my burger medium but it was cooked all the way through and the meat tasted bland and dry.  The truffle parmesan fries were a complete fail- they somehow managed to make them soggy and undercooked. The onion rings were ok but once I got to the bottom of the cone they were soggy.  The only good thing there was the server. She was attentive and really nice. I do not recommend this burger joint.  You're better off going to FatBurger and you'll spend a fraction of the price.  I cant believe this burger joint has 4 stars on Yelp. I think that most of these people that ate here were drunk so they thought it tasted good."}
{"text":"Another item crossed off my bucket list! Gordon Ramsay BurGR has been on my to-do list but somehow on every trip to Vegas (because of the long lines), I miss it. Not this time! We arrived to the restaurant about an hour to close and the line was fairly short. We waited about twenty minutes before reaching the hostess to sat us quickly. At forty minutes to midnight, the restaurant was jam packed. I may be the only one, but busy restaurants are usually more attractive to me then the slow ones. I was familiar with the menu and did not hesitate to order. We ordered the jalapeño poppers and gooey fries to share and I ordered the hog burger as my entree.   Roasted Jalapeño Poppers were an interesting menu item. Our waitress explained that all the poppers were seeded...except one (which had the seeds of all the peppers combined). The person that got the seeded jalapeño was in for a fiery surprise (of course I ended up with the fiery surprise). They were fried to a crisp with cheddar and bacon on the inside and each popper was sitting in it's own individual shot glass of cheddar ranch. 5 stars for presentation and flavor. Unfortunately, we had no warning on the temperature of the menu item (read on).   Gooey Fries were my favorite. I pretty much could have ordered these on their own and would have been a happy girl. Hand cut fries, with vintage white cheddar and smoked gouda cheese, toscano salami andddd an over easy egg made for an over the top flavor combination. This menu item is huge and absolutely shareable between four people. I really enjoyed these fries and would definitely order this item again.   The hog burger was exquisitely presented and looked like something from a magazine. Mangalitsa pork topped with mangalitsa bacon and BBQ pork, vintage white cheddar, pickles, crispy onion, and slaw made for a pretty high piled burger. Surprisingly, this burger did not reek of just BBQ. There was a complexity of flavors and textures that led to a delicious savory burger. I enjoyed the quality of the ingredients. The toasty sesame bun and the home made pickles added some really awesome flavors and textures.   Truly, based just on food, this restaurant deserves a five stars, but overall, my rating is a 3.5. Many people that go out to restaurant survey the food as the main portion of their review, but when I go out to eat; I expect that the service resembles and mimics the quality of the restaurant. Our waitress, a Caucasian girl was short and a little rude. Later, another waitress approached our table, a young Asian girl, and was much more genuine and kind. I wish I'd gotten their names but I did not get the chance. Customer service is definitely a big portion of the experience. Did I enjoy my meal? YES. Would I come back? Possibly, but the long lines, parts of the customer service, and peak prices might lead me elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place, to see how exactly Ramsay would elevate his burgers. What I found however was a mixed bag.   The service was phenomenal. And the highlight of my visit. Our server was very knowledgable of the menu and eager to share recommendations and describe the dishes. He returned several times throughout the meal to check on us.   The food, however, was not the over-the-top experience I expected and for the price, quite frankly, a disappointment. The bun was fluffy and tasty but my burger, which I ordered medium, was overdone and dry.   I have been back to BurGR since but still feel its a pricey spot when other alternatives exist nearby."}
{"text":"My husband and I are completely sold on this place. It has become a must-stop spot on our Las Vegas trips, so we've been there a couple of times by now.  First of all, this is a gourmet burger place so don't expect McDonalds pricing. Having said that, this Gordon Ramsay burger restaurant is very affordable to anyone looking for something extra but don't want to go all out and shell out cash for lobster and steak.  I'd say you'll end up spending an average of $25 per person, that's usually our tab, plus or minus a beer or two:) ) Compared to other places around Las Vegas, it really isn't bad because lesser burger places charge about as much and don't leave you nearly as satisfied as BurGR does.  Speaking of beers, they have some very good ones that are perfectly suited to their burgers, so ask your server for recommendations. I'm usually very happy with the beer here.  The burgers here are wonderful, nice and juicy, very flavorful thick patties, obviously cooked to perfection.  My favorite burger is the Euro Burger. I simply love the goat cheese/arugula combination. I also really love the Uber Cheese burger.  Cheese, cheese and more cheese! Can't go wrong!  My husband is a big fan of the Farm burger, it comes with a fried egg on top, it's also really good.  As far as sides are concerned, I think our favorite so far are the sweet potato fries.  It comes with powdered sugar (and they give you the powdered sugar jar so when you start losing the top fries with the sugar on it, you can add more yourself) and this delicious honey/jalapeno/mayo dip.  This has completely made me into a sweet potato fry snob, because I have yet to find any that measure up to these ones anywhere else. The regular french fries .... what I REALLY really really love about those is the CURRY KETCHUP that comes with them!! So good and so addicting!  (So even if you think it's boring to order \"just fries\" ..... don't worry.  With this ketchup along, it is far from boring.)  We usually end our meal with the tasty Sticky toffee pudding push pops.  It's a nice portion that fits perfectly in your belly right alongside the meal you just enjoyed.  Last but not least, the staff is wonderful. Always very friendly and helpful and attentive to your needs.   Definitely a Las Vegas favorite for us. After writing this review and thinking about these burgers for awhile, I'm kind of hankering for a Vegas trip all of a sudden..............."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat at in Vegas. Their burger is pretty delicious, but not the best just yet. Their fries are decently good. But what makes this place special to me is the decor and service. It is one of a kind with a cool fire display wall separating the outside and inside of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a Gordon Ramsay fan - not gonna lie so this review may be a little biased. My GF and I came starving after driving back from Zion. We hear the wait could be long but luckily it was only about 30min for us at around 1230pm on a Saturday.   Farm Burger - duck breast bacon + english sharp cheddar + fried egg: We ordered the burger medium rare and thats how it came. The bacon was aite - I prefer regular fatty bacon and the egg was cook perfectly. We split the burger in half to share so the yolk just oozed out coating the patty. Delicious.  Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings - parmigiano-reggiano + chipotle ketchup + cheddar ranch dip: My left favorite item.  It was a little greasy for my liking. The dipping sauces were incredible though.  Roasted Jalapeño Poppers - cheddar bacon + cheddar ranch + one fiery surprise: This is a MUST order. One order comes with 6 poppers. Each of is served in its own shot glass container. One bite and you'll see why people love this dish.  Truffle Parmesan Fries - hand cut fries + truffle parmesan + truffle salt + truffle aïoli: Yum! Thick, crispy and perfectly seasoned. Recommend!  Overall, BurGR was okay but prob hyped up. I would come back again and try their sticky toffee dessert that I missed out on since we ordered too much!"}
{"text":"Aside from the long wait, there was nothing to write home about here.  It was a burger.  The shakes were okay, but overpriced.  I get that it has the Gordon Ramsay name, but I would expect a more memorable experience for the price and the wait."}
{"text":"We had our first meal in Vegas here mostly because we were hungry and it was right next door to our hotel (we stayed at the Paris). I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Farm Burger. We shared the gooey fries. There isn't much to say but that it's a solid burger joint, the staff was polite and helpful. The only downside is that this is quite possibly the very first burger place I've been to that didn't have condiments on the table. I thought that was odd...I wonder if it is because Gordon Ramsay assumes his food is already seasoned to perfection."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about this place for years, we finally tried it. The service was very good. I had the Britannia burger and it was excellent. Cooked perfectly and the sweet to salty combination was perfect with its mango chutney and cheddar cheese. The meat was superb and cooked exactly how I ordered it, medium rare. I was really disappointed with the fries and the ketchup that came with them.   The service and customer service was great. The server accidentally hit the shake straw on the plate and it flipped up and splattered on my white top. She was very apologetic and the manager came over and offered dry cleansing and then comped our appetizer. It was an accident, I declined the dry cleaning but it was nice they offered.  We waited an hour for a table and with no reservations as an option and it being so popular, that's a negative. I would go back but I wouldn't say it's the best burger I've ever had. Probably a close second though. Overall I think it I would have enjoyed it more and rated it a 4 stars had it not been for the lousy fries, long wait and limited menu options."}
{"text":"My first Gordon Ramsay restaurant! Coming in, there was a small line but we were seated quickly. We ordered four different burgers, the Euro, Hell's Kitchen, Farm and Britannia. All were really good burgers. We each got a cocktail as well because why not?!   Hell's Kitchen Burger - ordered this burger medium is topped with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado and oven roasted tomato. One of the best burgers I've eaten. The patty was lean and juicy and the most surprsingly signature ingredient/topping here is the oven roasted tomato! I honestly thought it was an heirloom tomato or something because it is so flavorful and sweet. It really gives a nice contrast to the jalapeno peppers!  Truffle Parmesan Fries - one of the better side orders that I have had but it wasn't really the fries that I liked, but the aoli dipping sauce!  Onion Rings - massive and nicely fried. I can't tell how many times onion rings are fried but the inside is still raw. This time, it is made well and was sweet on the inside.   Skinny Screw - their version of a mojito and honestly.. it wasn't as minty at all. It wasn't a bad cocktail but I was really hoping for something more refreshing.   Overall, this place makes awesome burgers and well priced! I tried my friend's other burgers and they were all REALLY good. You honestly can't go wrong here unless you order your patty to be anything more than medium. The patties are pretty lean so medium-well and well-done will definitely be dry. The cocktail menu isn't bad but the drinks are not strong and seemed to be catered towards the female foodie. Next time i'll get a beer from them."}
{"text":"Oh Boy! I cannot tell you how satisfied I was after the meal around 1 am in Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  This is my first meal in Vegas after a long flight from NYC.  Yes, I was extrememly hungry at the time and probably could gobble down a cow, but really; they do make serious, top quality burgers.  The services was excellent. Waitress comes around every 5 mins and see if I need any help.  They even explained and detailed everything about the food.  This place gives you a feeling of a 3 star restaurant but provides 4 star service and 5 star food.  I also tried the sweet potatoe fries with seasalt.  I was none stop eating it even though I don't really like sweet potatoes. It was done in an almost perfect way.  Crunchy outside and soft inside with their special sauce to dip in.  Its funny that I forgot which burger I ordered, but I manage to ate 1 and 1/2 burger since my GF cannnot finish it, both burgers were very tasty.  The price for the burgers was not Cheap, but it definitely worth every penny.  I will definitely like to try Ramsay's other Chain in the future.  There are reasons he awarded 15 Michelin's Star."}
{"text":"Just had the Hells Kitchen burger and it was AWESOME.  Service is cute but Not overly attentive- it's Vegas, what do you expect!!  Burger was literally, mouth watering.  Killed some sweet -potato fries with jalepeno aioli...  Seriously.  A delicious burger, after leaving Guy's place up the street for a REAL burger !!!!  F donkey sauce in it's ear!"}
{"text":"BurGR is open late on Friday and Saturday nights. Unfortunately they do NOT allow reservations. So you have to wait if you want lunch or dinner at a traditional lunch/dinner time. I went there at around 12am at night, so there was pretty much no wait. We were seated almost immediately. Here's what is so wonderful about this restaurant that made me give it a 5:  1) Service -  The service here was SPOT ON. Our server was extremely friendly. He came by pretty much a couple of minutes after we got seated (I was too busy looking at the surroundings to be impatient too), and gave us an iPad to take a look at the drinks menu (pretty darn cool). He told us straight out that they were a little busy and that it might take him a little longer to get around to us. Just the fact that he told us that was a +1 in my book. Plus, he didn't actually take that long to get to us. The time in between him popping in our table to get the drinks order and to get the food order was perfect in my mind. We didn't feel rushed, and we didn't feel like it was too slow. It was great that when he served the food, he even told us what was the ingredients in each dish. It was also AMAZING that he didn't drop by too many times to ask how we were \"doing\" with the food. Another thing we noticed was that he never asked if we wanted more water, he just notices it and brings us a new cup of water (yes a new cup, not come by and refill the cup) without disrupting our conversation. Another +1 in my book.  I saw a couple of reviews where people complained about the girls in the front gossiping and talking amongst themselves. I have to admit that that part is a bit true. The girls who are seating you stood in the front in a group of two to three sometimes, and they were just talking with each other. HOWEVER, what differed in my experience was that though they were talking to each other, once I walked by the front desk to ask them where the restrooms are (they are right across the restaurant by the way, I was so dumb), they immediately snapped their attention to me and did not continue talking to each other until they've answered my question. I didn't feel like I needed to stand there and wait for them to finish talking or anything. They immediately noticed me and answered my dumb question.  2) Food - For a burger place, the food was pretty darn amazing. We got the five spice chicken sliders for appetizers and that was, I think, the greatest part about my meal. The chicken was PERFECTLY juicy and friend/cooked SO crispily. The five spices that were in the sliders were not overwhelming nor was it underwhelming. The sliders were not too salty, and it had just the right amount of creamy flavor. I loved it!  I got the Apple Cider drink that was recommended to us. It was made very well, and had very little hints of alcohol/beer in it. My partner and I are not a big fan of beer, yet we were able to stomach this very well because it tasted just like apple cider without the alcohol!  The truffle fries were amazing. It was not overly salty and it had a great balance of flavor. My taste buds are generally very sensitive to salt since I cook with very little salt and oil. Here, I did not feel that any of the food was overly salty at all.  For entrees we got the Hell's Kitchen burger and the Char Siu Burger. I thought the Hell's Kitchen burger was a bit better/unique than the Char Siu Burger. The Hell's Kitchen burger was great with the japaleno kick, and it was not super spicy at all. The Char Siu burger was a bit sweet, which was what added the edge to this burger. Both were very well made, to our specifications (medium rare). The buns are made in house and it was the right amount of fluffy and crispness. Also, during this whole meal we did not feel heavy at all, which was really amazing because many burger joints are very heavy. We felt full, but not bursting with oily/salty heaviness after the meal.   - - - - -  All in all, we felt that this place was a great value (it's not even THAT expensive) and the service was great, as was the food. I'd definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Finding a big delicious burger is a ritual of ours when in Vegas and for the last few trips, we ventured to the Strip to a cafe between a Rock and a Hard place. Absolutely nothing wrong with that place, but this time - after observing how often my kids watch Gordon Ramsey clips on Youtube, I thought it'd be fun to take them to the sidelines - even if we knew there's honestly a slim-to-none chance that he'd be there.  Planet Hollywood casino (and the mini mall area between parking and the restaurant) has a ton of burger places so make sure you find the right one - no matter how hungry you are, don't stop at an earlier one just because you found it first and are ravenous!  There was a little bit of a line.  The gals at the front need a few reminders to smile and speak up. After that, everyone had a great contagious enthusiasm that better represented the place.  My tween daughter had one priority - garlic fries! My teen son - burger!  We started with garlic truffle fries (Nobody tell her truffles are mushrooms) and an order of onion rings for the 3 of us to split - we really only got like 1/2 way through with the rest of the food so maybe next time we'll split 1 (though it's REALLY tough to choose just 1).  They also each ordered a pudding shake which I thought was a cool combo - a milk shake on the bottom and rich pudding on top!  My kids were less excited, but they're still of the age that they panic when foods \"touch\" each other.  They still finished off the shake parts quickly and I willingly ate the creme brulee off my daughter's shake for her!  My kids are strictly meat and cheese kids and it threw my son when he ordered the Uber cheeseburger and found out there is no sauce nor veggies!  I pointed out that is the sign of a great burger when you don't need the other stuff as frou frou pizazz!  It comes with 4 kinds of cheese that blended seamlessly for my kids' palates (though I'm willing to bet they couldn't pronounce any of them).  I went for the chanterelle burger (now I wasn't sure if these were mushrooms because they're so big and meaty).  It was delicious with the herb-marinated chanterelles and the arugula to counter the beef.  The figgy-onion jam either blended so well that it simply enhanced other flavors, or it wasn't there. But I'd have liked a little more sweet to really hit all the tastebuds.    Our Three-Thumb Review is three super stuffed thumbs up as high as we could lazily lift them! My tween daughter loves that she has the superpower to add bacon to her Uber Cheeseburger. My teen son thought this was a substantial burger that he could really sink his teeth into!  I personally loved being able to experience a pro's creative vision for how to put together flavors!  After this meal - our trip officially became a \"Foodie\" road adventure!  #ThreeThumbReviews"}
{"text":"Great food! Great first experience at a Ramsay restaurant. The restaurant is in the middle of two entrances to the Planet Hollywood casino. There is not a lot of seating, but the line moves fairly fast. The waiters and hosts were nice and did a good job overall.   We tried three burgers, a shake, the wings, and two different fries. Overall the food was great! The wings were very good, tangy, not too spicy. They are not served with ranch, but rather (I believe) sprinkled lightly with blu cheese and served with carrot strings(?). The taste was great and I didn't think they needed anything else.   The regular fries were ok, the sweet potato fries were much better.   We tried the euro burger, the spicy one and a chicken one. The chicken one was ok but nothing great. The euro had a great taste, the foie gras aioli really gave it a savory taste I felt at the tip of my tongue along with the juices from the perfectly cooked meat. [Note: we ordered our burgers well done, though I usually get mine medium, and they were still juicy.] The spicy one was really good and not as spicy as I thought it would be.   For shake we tried the banana with butterscotch. It is very sweet, almost overly so  at first. However once you mix it, the more you have the more you want. A friend recommended the Oreo shake, I will have to try it next time."}
{"text":"It feels odd reviewing Gordon Ramsay.  Anyways, I came here a few months back, waited in line like everyone else (there always seemed to be a line), then ordered burgers and fries when seated at the counter.  I found both burgers to be a bit lacking. I think I was expecting to bite into two wonderfully delicious burgers, but felt like I could've whipped up the same stuff at home."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The truffle parm fries were to die for. They do charge separately for the fries, but it is a huge serving and can be split by up to four people. My husband and I couldn't come close to finishing them. He got the fish and crisp sandwich,  which was delicious but hard to eat. I got the euro burger, which was to die for. You will be full when you leave. You will also be paying about $50 for two people.   I didn't try the shakes,  but that's what they're specialty is.   There was a line out to the casino, but overall it didn't take too long to get seated. I did see empty seats scattered around that had dirty tables. It seemed like the cleaning was holding everything up. Sad, since there wouldn't be too much of a wait if tables were cleaned right away.   Also, they have an interactive iPad with all of their drink choices and descriptions. This can be a positive and a negative. The waitress has to spend a lot of time explaining the program and showing you how to use it. She has to spend a lot of time at a new table for the iPad, which makes service suffer at other tabkes. However, the drink descriptions are nice and the program is cool to explore. However, it's basically a fancy menu that takes up time and energy and this is my only real complaint."}
{"text":"So went to Burgr on a busy Friday. It was St Patties day. Atmosphere is great and our server was great. The Oreo Shake is amazing. I had the Gordan burger with a fried egg, it was the feature of the week. It was okay and that why it's getting 3 stars. Burger lack flavor or seasoning. Very disappointed for such a pricey burger. The Truffle fries were very underwhelming as well. The wifey got the Hell's Kitchen burger and she loved it. I tried it and it was pretty good. The wing appetizer is also really good.   In closing for such a pricy burger I left very underwhelmed.   I'll come back to give them a 2nd chance but be warned place is cooler looking then the food taste."}
{"text":"The burger was good but I've had better.  I guess I expected more since this is their specialty."}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing special about this burger bar. I'm gluten free and ended up just having a cheese and lettuce on a burger patty. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the restaurant has a really cool vibe and our waiter was funny. Also, after telling them I was gluten free, I ordered a milkshake and they put a cookie on the top. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Very good burger. The milkshake was freaking amazing! Ramsay made a nice place. Staff is very professional and the atmosphere is trendy. Price is around $10 per burger and if you have a slot membership card you can get a buck off which is worth while to get since it is free and you can use it other places."}
{"text":"Had chicken soba. Soba tastes really good but chicken is burned and bitter."}
{"text":"While in Las Vegas, I took my son to Gordon Ramsay BurGR for his 13th birthday.  We're huge Gordon Ramsay fans, and this meal did not disappoint!  My son ordered a chicken burger with only a side of the house bbq sauce, and loved it!  (He's not big on \"extra stuff\" on his sandwiches.)  I had the Gordon Burger, which was the special, not on the menu.  It was made of mangalista pork and absolutely wonderful!  We also had the truffle parmesan fries, sticky toffee pudding, and shake #3, which has the best butterscotch pudding ever!  We had to take leftover burgers with us, and they were still really good, warmed up, the next day!!  Last of all, our service was beyond great!  We didn't feel like we were in a casual dining restaurant at lunch!  Best service EVER!"}
{"text":"I hate dropping reviews (especially for 5 star spots in my book)... but this would actually be a 3.5 review.... the awesome food bumps it up the other half.  Went with the char siu burger, ordered medium rare.  When my burger came out in front of me, it looked tiny and I noticed char all around the edges....I knew it wasn't MR.  I took a bite, and found it to be well done.    Asked for another to replace it, and the second time around was a super juicy, perfectly cooked MR with lots of juices hitting the plate.  Way better than my first visit here actually....but it took them a second try to cook it right!   It seems like the consistency might become a problem here...hopefully I am wrong.  I would order this one again, but I think I still prefer the farm burger.  The parmesan truffle fries are still the BEST thing evar.  I have had them on 3 separate occasions, and still hold them to be my MOST favorite french fry of all time.  Also, service was not nearly the same as the first time around.  My waitress let my drinks go dry every single time, with me asking for refills each time, and disappeared when my check arrived after I immediately put my $100 on the table to wait for change.  The busperson was the one to pull my plates, refill my water the majority of the time, and actually took my bill to get me change because he noticed me standing up in the restaurant, waiting to leave.  The server was not good at her job, and if I was rating off of service alone, we would be at 2 stars.    I hope next visit goes smoothly.  If I ever get this server again, I will request another seat."}
{"text":"This was one of the best burgers I have ever had. The seasonings were perfection and service was good. The fries are steak cut and 1 side is enough to share. We didn't have to wait long for a table (at 5pm on a Friday), so we sat happily. It was our anniversary, and our waitress brought us complementary champagne. Overall, I was pleased. For Vegas, the price wasn't bad, the service was good, and the food was great! I only wish there were more burgers to choose from and that modifying the options wasn't so expensive ($4 for avacado and $5 for bacon)."}
{"text":"The food is good but everything comes separate. You have to order your burger and fries separate so it can get a little pricey. The sweet potato fries were some of the best that I've had. It's a cool place to go and eat with friends. It's a fun atmosphere:)"}
{"text":"After an epic guys trip to Vegas we needed that icing on the cake and it could only be one thing: a trip to Gordon Ramsay's Burgr. I've been a fan of his for a long time (Hells Kitchen and MasterChef). I had to pay homage to a man with amazing culinary skills, a short fuse but with a big heart.  I felt like I was on a pilgrimage walking though the endless mall at Planet Hollywood. Got lost twice, but finally made it to the restaurant. The iconic flames in the window welcomed me home.     I was excited to see there was no wait. We were welcomed by beautiful people who quickly took us to out table. For a Sunday morning, people were in good spirits and it was a lively atmosphere. Although situated within a casino, they did a pretty good job with the layout to minimize that fact.  I ordered the Hells Kitchen burger fries and Shake #2. Although not the best burger I've had (some that top BGR in LA) it was pretty darn good. The shake and fries were the best. I loved the homemade ketchup.   This is a must stop for a quick bite in Vegas. Can't wait to be back and try something else. Thanks Chef Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of amazing! I'm so glad I was able to try out this place after hearing so many good things from my friends. We went for dinner on a Friday night. Got there maybe around 6 or 6:30 and had to wait about 40 minutes for a table for 2. I suggest going in for lunch instead. Sadly when we went, they were doing some construction on one side of the restaurant, and we were seated next to it with a curtain dividing us. Our server was very friendly and attentive to us, answering questions and giving us some suggestions since it was our first time there. Even threw in a few jokes here and there.   Farm Burger - There's so much flavor packed into this that I had to stop eating half way through and take a break. Had my patty cooked medium rare and my gosh it was amazing! Juicy, tender and just plain perfect. It was a little heavy for me so I'd probably order a different burger next time.  Southern Yardbird Burger- This was my boyfriend's choice and I actually liked this better than the Farm burger! It was lighter but still tasted so good. The meat was cooked wonderfully and it wasn't dry at all! Definitely not your typical chicken burger.   Parmesan truffle fries - I'm typically more of a fan of skinny fries so I was a little skeptical when I saw that they used steak fries. All my doubts flew out the window and into the fire display when I tried them. Even though we were stuffed from our burgers, we still managed to finish off these fries.   It's a little steep for a burger, but you definitely get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about this place and I honestly can't wait to go back.  I went with the standard 'American' Burger and it was tremendous.  Great beef, cooked perfectly, and seasoned plenty.  In Vegas, a lot of people will argue that most if not all restaurants are overpriced, but I really don't have a problem paying $15 or so for a burger when it tastes like this.  Between here and the Pub and Grill, Gordon Ramsay is killing it right now.  I can't wait to hit up Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris.  On top of the burger we also order the onion rings and chicken sliders as an appetizers and both were phenom.  I wish the chicken slider came in a full sized burger portion, because it would make for a great entree.  The ranch here is also amazing, and nothing beats quality ranch."}
{"text":"Everytime i'm in Vegas I must go to BurGR.  This is a burger must have.  This will be the best burger you ever have.  I have had the duck bacon burger and the earth burger which both were delicious.  Don't leave without having the truffle aioli fries, you'll regret it if you do. The wait is a little long but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and try to eat only organic foods....but this place is my exception!!! All of the milk shakes are amazing.  And you can have them make a meatless burger.  Yummy fries!"}
{"text":"So I put my faith in something unknown I'm living on such sweet nothing But I'm tired of hope with nothing to hold I'm living on such sweet nothing at...GORDON RAMSAY BURGR! - Calvin Harris (sweet nothing)  Because they don't take reservations ahead of time, the wait can be pretty ridiculous. We came here at like 10 pm and there was still a 45 min wait. Fortunately once you put your name down, you can go wherever you want and they text your phone letting you know your table is ready (better than having to carry around a pager). Luckily, the shops at Planet Hollywood were still open so we just walked around until our table was ready.   We shared a peanut butter milkshake that was really tall and came with a soft delightful cookie. The farm burger was pretty good, not the best burger but certainly above average. The duck bacon that came with it was interesting. We also ordered a side of the truffle fries and sweet potato fries and although both were huge portions, they were not great overall. I've had more satisfying room service fries at 5 am than these ones. The dipping sauces were nice but I would say pass on their fries unless you really need fries with your burger.   Overall, I would give this place a 3 but given the waitress that we had who was very upbeat and helpful, I have no problems bumping it up. It's Vegas so the restaurant itself is cool and trendy as well. I'd suggest waiting until the hype cools down a bit to give this place a try...wayyyy too busy for what are ultimately mediocre burgers."}
{"text":"Great food and good service.   Try the ahi mini sliders.  They are most excellent!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment!  My wife and I are fans of Gordon's TV shows and visited this restaurant during a visit to Vegas with 5 other friends, all from different cities.  The only good thing I can say is that the 1.5 hr wait for a table that we were quoted was accurate, after that nothing was up to what you would think of as \"Gordon Ramsay\" standards.  We imagined we would see the clockwork precision that Gordon demands on television, we were wrong.  The staff seemed to be in chaos, bumping into each other.  The waiter was awkward and didn't seem to know how to interact with patrons.  Two of the burgers had to be sent back because they were well done, when we had asked for pink in the center.  The replacements did come out fast but were then cut in half, I suppose to prove they were now pink.  I'm not a kid and if I wanted my burger cut in half I would do that myself.  Additionally, the gooey fries were not ready until well after the burgers arrived, excuse was they were getting the cheese melted but shouldn't they really be out with the burgers?  To make matters worse when the manager came around to feign interest in our dining experience we let her know about all of these disappointments and she pretty much ignored us.  We didn't get the impression she was interested in actually hearing how things went, just walking around and pretending to care.  Our entire group agreed that the burgers were nothing special, the buns were the best part, and none of us would ever visit again.  If our experience is the norm then I think this restaurant exists solely on name recognition.  Even the chairs were uncomfortable, like sitting at the kiddie table, making the 1.5 hr wait absolutely not worth it.  I would not recommend BURGR and will never visit again."}
{"text":"Was recommended to get the Hell's Kitchen burger, which has avocado and jalapeño -- two of my favorite things. It did not disappoint. Got it medium rare, and it came cooked perfectly. One of the best burgers I've had. Sweet potato fries were pretty good too."}
{"text":"This is a biased review for I am a Gordon Ramsay fanatic.  I'm going to keep this review short and simple.  The food was ah-mazing, the decor was beautiful, the menu was unique, the service was exceptional.  The quality of the ingredients was everything I expected.  I also enjoyed the mini Ipad drink and dessert menu.  The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the choice of outfits for the servers.  It was tacky and it cheapened the look of the entire venue.  I'm not sure what Gordon was going for but as a female, I was a tad offended that the female waitresses wore outfits that reminded me of Hooters and that the guys were completely covered up.  And don't get me started on the clothing material..."}
{"text":"The food is awesome here, if you try anything at all, you must try the parmesan truffle fries and one of the shakes! We ordered the All American Cheeseburger and the 3 cheese burger (cant remember the name exactly) but everything was so good! the service was awesome as well.  The Hostess needs a little more energy though, she yawned way too much sitting at the front and didn't seem to really want to do much, but the servers were outstanding! Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Sad, pricey and dirty.     A' la carte is another word I would use.  When you order a burgr, you get a burger.  They don't have chocolate milkshakes.   .Sorry!   But.  If you would like a piece of chewing gum, that they do have...  ...Just check under the table.  Yum."}
{"text":"I had heard many great things about this place before my latest visit to Vegas.  So this was put at the top of my list to visit.  Got here on a Thursday night and our party of 3 was seated immediately.  We waited about 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us.  I took immediate notice to the dress code of the servers.  EVERY SINGLE waitress had to tug down their one piece \"dress\" for every 10 steps they took.  Unnecessarily tight for servers in a restaurant... but it wasn't just the women... the men had on Polo's that also appeared to be suffocating them.  The only people who looked to be comfortable in their uniforms were the floor managers.   We did get our beers fairly quickly, once greeted by our waitress.  Everything on the menu is ala-carte, which is like most places in Vegas.  Between the 3 of us, we ordered the Uber Cheese Burger,  Britannia Burger, Chantenele burger and the Parmesan Fries.   We all ordered our burgers medium.    I'm still laughing at the irony of being in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and waiting 45 minutes for our burgers to come out.  Mind you, there was no wait, it was 11pm and the restaurant was at less than half capacity.  Even more ironic, all of our burgers came out well done.  Now, we all cut our burgers into 3's and split amongst ourselves to sample it all.  Even though our burgers were not cooked the way we wanted, they were all very tasty.  I could only image what they would be like had the meat been a little pink.   The parmesan fries were good and the sauces that came with were a treat.  I only rate 3 stars as being a fan of Gordon's shows - I know the slow service we received as well as overcooked food is unacceptable to his standards."}
{"text":"I had the Ramsay Burger, and I only eat burgers well done. I expected some backtalk, but no...they took the order without acting all offended, and executed perfectly. The bun part wasn't  as good as the buns used at Mesa. The fries were very good, though I wish they would offer ranch or plain ketchup for dipping. Here is another Pepsi product place. I don't get why all those casinos contract with Pepsi, yuck. The waiter was top notch, the hostesses were more into looking good and talking to each other than guest interactions, at least when we were there. Some random guy behind me had been bugging me the whole time in line, and my daughter had been in the restroom, so when I said \"table for two\" they thought el creepo and I were together. You would think the hostesses would have a better read on people, but they weren't paying attention to anything but each other. They were like the Robert Palmer girls...bored and pretty. Might have given 5 stars if they had been on point and if other dipping choices were available."}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Ramsay,   I have to say I expected a lot more, sir. For someone who does a lot of finger waving and criticizing, your own restaurant does not meet your standards. Please don't be mad. I am just being honest with you.  Thanks,  Deena  We wanted burgers. This place looked awesome. So we came here. We came an hour before closing. The place was fairly busy. We were seated fairly quickly. The chairs are low and the table is higher so it was awkward. The table was filled with items and not much space to put my stuff (phone, wallet). The server was OK although he seemed tired and ready to go home. His demeanor was not genuine nor happy. We ordered the spicy hot dog as an appetizer. It was AMAZING and the main reason they earned three stars. It had a fresh toasted bun, fresh jalapenos and peppers, and the right amount of sauces. We ordered regular fries but they brought us truffle Parmesan fries. We were too tired to complain and send it back so we ended up taking it home. They were OK. The burgers were nothing special. I had the Hell's kitchen burger and my husband had the truffle burger. There was a weird after taste in mine and it as not as spicy as I had hoped. We left unfulfilled. We were so unimpressed that we decided to avoid any other restaurants with GR name on it. All in all, if you come here, get the hot dog. That is it. Also, the place had the feeling of a TGIF or Chili's. Even the service was not that great. The experience was definitely not what we had hoped for."}
{"text":"Great burger place. If you are staying at the Planet Hollywood is a must go. Service is good and food is delicious."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay BURGR is a fun modern style twist on the classic hamburger joint (think 50's diner with modern detail). Location is superb at the entrance to Planet Hollywood, which as hotel/casino environments go is very approachable but also not so upscale.   The restaurant has an awesome fire feature and the design aspects are very cool. Restaurant was open 11am-2am and we walked in around 1:00am to grab a delicious bite.  As it go's with many places in Vegas, acquiring quality skilled talent is a challenge. This may explain the weak reception at the front desk, where it took three young staffers to figure out how to get us a table.   On approach, one smiled and acknowledged us, the other stared blankly at me, and the third was ought-right arrogant and totally self absorbed.   Most restaurants forget that the hostess is the face of the restaurant, the first place you make contact, and it sets the tone for the experience. So load up on quality talent in this key role, would be my advice for this and all restaurants looking to make a good first impression  But once we got past that none sense, the experience was very good.  Our server was great, the Hell's Kitchen burger with avocado and Asadero cheese was a really cool combo.  The fries and onion rings come with chipotle Ketchup, and there's also a curry Ketchup that gives an Indian hint to the other seasonings and flavors.  Good food, good location, fun concept. Staff works hard, is eclectic and funky, but hostesses should be recruited from somewhere where there's an actual motivation to be working as opposed to an entitled sense of inconvenience for having to seat you.  If you're walking the strip late night or hungry during the day, stop here for one of the BURGR's"}
{"text":"There is long line, especially there is more than 3 parties. (You need to ask for a seat for more than 3 parties on the front desk.)  In my opinion, foods are good if you drink with beer or wine because burgers and fries are  little salty and strong seasoning. I just ate them with water.  And they asked me to add extra mushroom and eggs on the burgers. I said \"Yes\" but didn't ask about the additional costs. each side is $3. (total: 6 dollars for mushroom and egg) And pepsi is $4.  So I paid $41 excluded tip for 2015 gordon ramsay burger and onion ring. It is almost like best buffet dinner price at hotel.   You might like it or not. In my opinion, it is not worthy for the price."}
{"text":"Had lunch here this past weekend and the food was terribly disappointing.  My boyfriend and I had about a 45 minute wait which wasn't a big surprise.  Once we were seated, we were greeted in a timely manner with an iPad to order drinks or shakes.  The waitress was pleasant and patient while we made our decision.  We ordered the chanterelle mushroom burger, the uber cheeseburger, and an order of sweet potato french fries.  We waited about 35 minutes for the food to arrive.  Both burgers were very dry and overcooked as well as cold.  The sweet potato french fries had clearly sat under the heat lamp for way too long.  They were hard, cold, and just awful.  We barely touched the fries and the server didn't inquire so they just sat on the table untouched.  So we paid $45 for two terrible burgers and the worst french fries ever. A new server approached the table, (gross fries still on the table) and cashed us out. We left $5 for the lame experience and as we were exiting the restaurant, the original waitress came running after us claiming that we were walking out on our bill, simply clueless. Came to Vegas to celebrate my boyfriends 50th birthday and to have extraordinary dining experiences.  We had anything but extraordinary at BurGR, very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Long waits, average prices, delicious foods :) this past week was my second time here at burgr, and the wait this time (1hr 15mins) was even longer than my first time (45mins)! Planet Hollywood has like a million shops, so I had plenty to preoccupy myself whilst waiting. But well worth the wait, I got my favorite from last time, the euro burger and a side of truffle fries. Their truffle aioli, literally amazing. The fries to stand to be a bit crispier, but I'm just nit picky. All in all my experience was just as good as last time, the staff are all attractive people, and very nice as well. They got one of my table member's orders wrong, and corrected it without questioning or anything. Still highly recommend burgr, and cannot wait to come back! :)"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of burgers but this place was delicious!! I had the Britannia which had a mango chutney in it, a patty, arugula, and cheese. It was a great combination of sweet and savory and very unique. Towards the end I did feel like the mango was a little too sweet and overpowering but not too bad. I wouldn't order it again but I am looking forward to trying out the other burgers! There are some really unique sounding ones that you can't find anywhere else. The fries were alright..I had the truffle fries and it was nothing special. Service was great as well. Will be back for desserts and their other burgers."}
{"text":"It was so good, I can barely discuss it.  This was my last meal in Vegas and my god, did we go out with a bang!  The Line Up:  5 Spice Chicken Sliders---- really different, tasty, almost a vietnamese feel because of the pickled element.  Truffle Parm Fries---- Wowza. Not your typical fry & the parm/spices were on every fry, not just showcased at the top of the fry cone.   Uber Cheese Burger----Every element was mouth watering delicious. The bun, the beef, the combination of cheeses... so good.   Shake #4, we took this to go- Creme Brulee pudding atop of an oreo cookie shake. Orgasmic.   All burger/slider/fry component came with two different dipping sauces, infused ketchups, etc.   Service was wonderful. Ashley made great suggestions and was efficient and accommodating.   My sister and I are chatterboxes. We barely said a thing, the food spoke for us.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"It's an easy place to find if you can get to the Planet Hollywood hotel. On the inside just to the left after you walk in and look for the flames. Usually about a 10-20 minute wait to get seated.   The good - the burgers, of course!  It's what we came for, so celebrate your non-vegan side and pick your poison. Many different choices but simple enough not to get too weird either. I had the Gordon Ramsey burger, which you have to ask for, but had it with a beef patty instead of the pork. Medium is perfect for myself, but they'll cook it anyway you like short of raw...Great, but not mind blowing flavor, very well put together and the duck bacon is an interesting touch. I still think I make a better burger at home :-)  I had the onion rings, as well and they could have been a bit crunchier. The whiskey lemonade was strong and cold but $15 a shot so be ready to pay if you're drinking too.  A good place for a solid burger, but expect to pay for it with Gordon's name attached to the place. I'd definitely go back and probably will. Def good eats there!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved my visit here.  My husband and I stopped here before heading to check out the Goretorium. The atmosphere is pretty decent. It's open to the casino so it's a bit loud but the seating and table were comfortable. Service was super friendly. Very informative, helpful, chatty. The manager even stopped by at one point which I always find to be a nice touch. Now the food. Best burger I have had in Vegas! We both ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger with jalapeno pepper and avocado. It was perfectly cooked, great size. The flavors were awesome. We also had the truffle fries, well worth it. Even the ketchup was flavorful.  We had the pork belly appetizer to split. I loved the sauce on it. Price was a bit high for lunch, I'd say $$$ not $$ but that was mainly because we ordered the fries and an appetizer. For just a burger it wouldn't be bad and they were plenty big enough to fill you up. But who can skip fries? The beer selection is also pretty good. 30 beers on tap."}
{"text":"It was dinner time when me and my co-worker had arrived, and it was a 20 minute wait. They took my cell phone number and texted me when our table was ready. NEVER seen that before lol. It was 20 minutes as the hostess had promised and we got seated next to the window. The server was really funny and nice.   I ordered the Farm Burger, the sweet potato fries and chocolate shake. On the burgers don't come any condiments so they dipping sauce they gave me for the fries, I used for my burger lol. It was so good. They give you a shaker of sugar for your fries and I must of used it all up. The only thing I didn't enjoy much was the shake. It just didn't taste any different than a regular chocolate shake I had at any other restaurant.   I had to get a to-go box because it was to much to handle. I had to finish the rest of the food the next day. I will love to go back and try a different burger or even a hot dog!"}
{"text":"The reason why I didn't adore Gordon Ramsay BurGR as much as I should have is no fault of my burger, the restaurant, the wait, or the man himself. The fault is entirely my own.  I rolled in around 2 PM because I overslept and we had to wait for an hour. Luckily, GRB texts you when your table is ready, so we went off in search of drinks. One visit to Fat Tuesdays later, I get the text message and we drunkenly ordered two orders of truffle parmesan fries and our burgers.  Now, two orders of fries is a little (a lot) extreme. You don't need two. But oh my god, these fries are delicious. And they come with this unbelievable truffle aioli that I want to dip everything into. If I only knew how to make one thing in my life, I would want to know how to make this truffle aioli.   I ordered the farm burger, which comes with an egg and some sort of duck bacon, which made me excited, because I love duck. The burger was very good, the egg was perfect, and the bacon was disappointing because it didn't taste like duck, but whatever. The only problem? I was so full of alcohol that I really didn't enjoy the burger as much as I could have.  Well, it looks like I'll just have to find another excuse to come back!"}
{"text":"Ramsay has a burger joint and a steak joint within the same city! Brave move good sir!   I really enjoyed this place and this place isn't as overpriced as most places are in Vegas. Don't get me wrong, it's still overpriced, but just not as bad.   The burgers are cooked to perfection and while they aren't as good as Holsteins, they are still pretty amazing. Like the steak house they also give you an ipad to order your drinks from which can get a little annoying.   Still, this is a top notch place in the heart of Vegas and would come here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"When the coasters, menus and sign out front all have Gordon Ramsey's name on them, the is set quite high right from the start.   I had the American Burger from BURGR and it was outstanding! My drink was the number 1 Shake which was chocolate with caramel pudding and whipped crime. AMAZEBALLS! The service was exceptional. BURGR lost a star because the French fries were below sub-par. I've had better fries at Mickey D's."}
{"text":"Lackluster in flavor for what you'd expect of its eponym, Gordon Ramsey; however, defintely a tourist draw. Service and presentation were excellent, but for hamburgers and a couple of sides, you better be ready to shell out close to $40 bucks a person, sans drinks."}
{"text":"Don't understand the hype- love Gordon Ramsey but there's no way this place did him justice. Waited in a long line to get seated with a friend. We each ordered a speciality burger and a basket of truffle fries.   The burger was plain, nothing special. Tasted like your typical burger. Ate it because I was hungry, but I had no desire to finish it after eating half. The truffle fries were good, though a little salty- had to brush the saltiness off.   The food was expensive and lacked a distinguishing flavor. Maybe it's just Vegas, but I expected much more out of a popular restaurant. A disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Ok this place is a rock star. Why? Let's break it down.  1) Staff- these people are awesome. Our waiter was attentive, full of good suggestions, honest, and really entertaining. Even the managers come and serve you! They really have a team approach here of getting things done.  2) Food- their menu is not really big, but what they do serve they do it well. They have burgers, onion rings, and fries. It was all good. Even the burger with the fig jam that some may be hesitant to try was awesome. They have a lot of fun flavors! 3) Ambiance- it is a casual place but still trendy. Their floor plan is open, you can see the chefs working on your food, and they have fire decorations. Cool!  4) Cost- this is a bang for your buck place in Vegas! You really get good food for what you pay. It is super affordable.   PS. Don't even think about sharing. You will want your own. Trust me"}
{"text":"Went here last night for the first time. The sweet potato fries with powdered sugar take the sweet potato game to the next level. I ordered their most popular burger, the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was served within 20 minutes, warm, juicy and on a lightly toasted bun. The food was an A+ and service time was within the good dining experience limit."}
{"text":"Every time I am in Vegas we visit Gordon Ramsey Bugr. If you are a diamond star total rewards card holder you get to go in the shorter line :) I always order my Burger with their truffle fries. The price is decent and not bad for food on the strip. Definitely my go to!"}
{"text":"Good shakes decent burgers, they have long lines in front although there are tables available to make it seem exclusive."}
{"text":"I know Gordon Ramsey has quite a few restaurants in Vegas and this place was the one I really wanted to try. It's not that I love burgers or 'American' food but just because I am a big fan of Hell's Kitchen and Gordon Ramsey, I had to come and try.  They close at 12:00 AM and us group of 5 went in around 11:30 PM. I asked the server if it was OK for us to dine in and he said it was fine but we need to order everything at once since kitchen was closing soon.  Since a couple of us were not that hungry we decided to share some food. We asked for recommendation besides the one we knew we had to order but they overlapped so we got Hell's Kitchen Burger (2), Euro Burger and Beer Bettered Maui Onion Rings. Their menu has a good description of every food and they have 2 different prices. One price is the regular price and one in ORANGE indicates the discounted price for Total Rewards members. I forgot my TR card but my friend had it so we were able to get discounted prices for every item that we ordered.  I really liked Hell's Kitchen Burger. I liked that little kick that roasted jalapeño peppers gave. It wasnt super spicy or stronf but there was definitely a little something. Avocado made the overall flavor a lot more rich on top of asadaro cheese. Also that soft texture of oven roasted tomatoes were very pleasing.  Everyone liked Hell's Kitchen Burger more than the Euro Burger. Euro burger is very different because it had truffle aioli but I didnt find it too special. It was barely there if you know what I mean. It also had oven roasted tomatoes for that particular texture. Goat cheese in the burger had that special smell but the flavor again, was not rich enough.  Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings were super delicious! The batter was very thick in a way but it was super crunchy and flavorful. It was served with chipotle ketchup and cheddar ranch dip but I usually like to eat my food without any sauce so I did not try. My friends told me they like the cheddar ranch dip a little more over chipotle ketchup even though both were pretty satisfying.  Service was average. Servers were busy closing since it was already past their closing time. I totally understans but I had to wait forever to get their attention to ask for a check.   I would like to come back and try their other burgers ans that sticky pudding everyone is talking about!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burger. Staff was less than mediocre. I'm sitting at the counter in front of the kitchen staff and not only do I wait for an eternity while others get their food and finish up before I even have mine yet, but my waiter brings the burger without my fries. I had eaten half my burger when the fries were brought out. I expected better for a $20 burger and $10 fries. I ate there on 3/25 at 3:45pm check 1867460. Table C2. Server Gregg."}
{"text":"After going to the comedy show at Harrah's and walking down the Strip Friday night, I figured I'd finally try Gordon Ramsay's burger joint. It was one of the main restaurants that were still open after midnight on the weekends (they stay open till 2am).  Hopped right to the bar and ordered a beer. I went for the Blue Burger. After placing my order with the sexy waitress, I sipped my beer and waited.  Ramsay gets a 10 on the presentation side! The order of fries were served in a odd looking cone-shaped contraption that held two dipping sauces, a curry ketchup and some chipotle ketchup. Both were tasty. The burger itself was cooked to my specification (medium well) and had a nice crust on it. The arugula added a nice peppery bite and the blue cheese oozed alll over..I'm in heaven.  The bill came up to $35 with a beer. Left the bartender a fiver as a tip since she did a pretty decent job after all."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS CoFFE MILKSHAKES!!! My friend and I got the Euro Burger which was tasty for two! My fave was the milkshake! It was tasty and SO Yummmmay! The sweet potato fries are pretty standard, but delicious none the less! =)"}
{"text":"Was hungry after finishing my workout at Madera Soa...wanted to try BURGR based on a recommendation...it was well with it! The Jalapeño Poppers were on point. Not greasy, not salty, even though I only had 2 of the 6 that comes in the order, hey, portion control! It was soooooooo good! I also ordered the Hell's Kitchen BURGR with the ground chicken patty instead...oh wow. It was moist, juicy without it being salty! Came with roasted peppers, roasted jalapeño, added the butter lettuce, sauce on the side and asedero cheese. Scouped out the dough from the bun and it still held the BURGR together. It was well worth it! Got the sweet potato fries but again,  only had about 1/4 of them because they give you so much!  But they were so tasty. No salt as well per my request. Will definitely come back anytime and every time I'm in Vegas! The waitress Cassie was extremely helpful and made sure my request of no salt was taken care of. She had a great attitude and was very friendly. She was awesome! Her shift had ended but made sure that Janet would follow up and take care of me. Janet did just that. She was great as well! Pleasant experience with the staff. Very courteous."}
{"text":"Busy place but for a good reason- the food is delicious! My Earth burger (portobello) was seasoned perfectly to give it taste and was rounded out with shaved vegetables on top and earthy shredded arugula. The regular fries also have great seasoning and were large enough for two people to share. The jalepeno margarita had just enough jalapeño to give it an appropriate kick without being over the top. My husband enjoyed the Hell's Kitchen burger, which he described as having \"just enough spice without making me sweat.\" Love the creative menus, which also save on taking up unnecessary table space. Our server was also very friendly and efficient. We stood in what appeared to be a long line but thanks to all the large parties in front of us that hadn't gone up to the hostess stand, we made it to the front pretty quickly and were seated immediately after. Larger parties should go straight to the hostess stand so they can get put into the text queue when tables are ready (the signs even tell you to go straight up there). The restaurant is a bit loud, due to how busy it is and its surroundings within Planet Hollywood but you don't need to shout to still have a nice lunch or dinner. We were there for lunch and there were quite a few families with little kids the parents let run around but the tables are so close, the kids thankfully seemed to get bored of this right away."}
{"text":"I got suckered into a celebrity restaurant and ended up paying LOTS of money for an average meal.   Am I proud of that? no.  Will I come back? no.  Burgers were literally meh- nothing special. Sweet potato fries were good, although they tasted more like a dessert with powdered sugar on top.  The only thing I really liked were the wings- more like chicken lollipops. The sauce was yummy and the meat was plentiful. Wish I would have just ordered that as an entree.   Grand total for wings, 2 burgers, and fries? *drumroll* $80!  Yah...... I get it's \"Gordan Ramsay's restaurant\" and it's on the strip, but holy cow.. $80 is A LOT of money for a burger joint."}
{"text":"Loved it! We only waited about 10 minutes in line last Sunday around 5pm. Sat at the counter and had a wonderful experience. The service was top notch and the food met all of our expectations.   Ordered: Maui Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries, Farm Burger, Hell's Kitchen Burger"}
{"text":"Oh....my...  Ummmm.... If you are visiting Vegas this place is a MUST! Go here and indulge all your taste buds and nose sensors with this sensational food! We started dinner with the pork buns (which i personally wouldn't recommend...not enough pork belly, too big of a bao bun, and way too many shredded carrots, though still tasty, not their specialty) and the jalapeño poppers, which comes out with six single poppers in a shot glass with a special sauce that even my brother who eats no veggies enjoyed and wanted them all to himself. No where else can you have such a succulent burger cooked to perfection with high quality meat and ingredients. The farm burger and the uber cheese burger are fricken amazing! AMAZING! Then you need to also try the truffle fries but only get one order, a party of 5 had a hard time finishing the hearty portion and we love to eat! Lastly we had the Oreo shake with the creme brûlée on top....oh man I'm drooling just recalling how perfectly balanced the sweetness was and how nicely the textures coated my mouth with rainbows and unicorns. Oh yes...yes...yes...YES! Hehe... I'm getting carried away, but seriously, save some room and get it!  Now that I'm done raving about the food, let me comment on the overall atmosphere.... which is chic casual in a wonderful contemporary way with an amazing entrance that includes a wall of fire. Our waiter, Alex with the glasses, was quite witty and a pleasure to banter with back and forth. My little brother was tickled pink that he was unafraid to go head to head with me in all my silly smartass glory. Lets just say he received a $60 tip. Only complaint if I had to make one, the restaurant seemed a bit loud, it could benefit from a little less commotion, though it doesn't detract from the experience."}
{"text":"Came to BurGR with my friends before we departed ways as our weekend in Vegas has came to an end. We got here at about 12pm on a Monday and our group of 6 was seated almost instantly.   The waitress told us it was going to be about 20 minute wait to get our burgers. We ordered our fries and shakes to come out while we waited for the burgers. We got sweet potato and Parmesan truffle oil fries. Both were good- but the House Ketchup made both fries AMAZING!! (and I don't even like ketchup).   We got our burgers. I got the hells kitchen and it was tasty. My friends enjoyed there's as well- they got the euro, bleu cheese and american.  The creme brûlée and Oreo shake was also very delicious! Something that we never even heard of before.   Overall we had a good experience at BurGR and will be recommending it to our friends when they visit Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Matt aka David the red haired head trainer was the best server we've had in a very long time. He's such an experienced server and spoke very highly of Gordon Ramsey and would make subtle positive mentions of Ramsey throughout our dining experience. What a delight he is and loves what he does you can really tell! Our extremely picky group loved Matt and all agreed he should be restaurant manager. The food was very fresh and we never had our glasses half empty. Service was impeccable and really made this experience special. Thank you Matt for the lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Sorry Chef Ramsay but please don't bloody yell at me but your gourmet burgers are overrated.  Wouldn't pay the price for the burger even it was half the price.  Didn't have enough flavor and the juiciness of a great burger to satisfy my appetite."}
{"text":"Well, I live in LA and I frequent Vegas quite often. I usually stay at Planet Hollywood which means I have the pleasure of visiting Gordan Ramsay's BURGR as much as I stay there.   The expectations are always high for a Gordan Ramsay establishment and this restaurant should not be any different. It did not disappoint in the least bit. I love coming here for a very good quality burger and great service.   Last time I was there, tried a bit of everything!  The Fury Chicken wings- Deep fried to perfection. Nice and crispy with a side of blue cheese, you can't go wrong. Warning* They are hot!  The Truffle Parmesan Fries- Delicious fries topped with parmesan cheese and a yummy truffle oil. Not too overpowering.  The Fire Roasted Chili Dog- So good and tasteful. The chili was just as good as the hotdog itself.  The Blue Burger- I love blue cheese and here is no exception! The burger was juicy and so good! Cooked to perfection!   I highly highly recommend visiting this restaurant next time you are in Vegas. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a farm house burger and hubby had the American burger. My burger was super juicy I think because of the egg yolk oozy on to the bun along with the fat from the duck bacon. Hubby said his was not seasoned and not juicy and does not recommend that burger. We paired it with the truffle fries. Super delish with the aioli and the house made ketchup. Overall pretty good just make sure to go early or you'll end up waiting."}
{"text":"We brought our son to Las Vegas to attend school and we decided to check out BurGr as we love everything Gordon Ramsey is connected to. Well it did not disappoint. Holy cow what a great place. The service was friendly and appealing. Could use a busser or two as our table filled up quickly with appetizer plates and such and not even cleared when our burgers were brought to us. But a minor detail as the burgers where awesome. Wow. What flavor and the fries,  wow. Our favorite were the truffle fries and the sweet potato fries. Could pass for a dessert type but we of course had to try the Oreo shake. Yummy all the way around. We left with our bellies full and vowing to visit the next time we are in town. Our new favorite place."}
{"text":"Ate here for my first night in Vegas before EDC. The food was okay, not nearly what the reviews had me expecting.   More importantly, I got food poisoning.  Not an awesome way to start my weekend. Stay away from this mediocre poison factory."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Worth every penny for the Hells Kitchen Burger... Also, Oreo Cookie Shake - A must have!!  Service was great from the beginning to the end.."}
{"text":"Awesome as always!  He was here earlier today but we missed him! Oh well, another excuse to eat his food! :)"}
{"text":"Arrived at 11:30, waited in line for 15 minutes to put my name down, and was quote 30-35 minutes by the hostess. Okay, no problem. We got back out front at 12:10pm since my Canadian cell phone would not work here (she asked to take my number down before) so we can wait for our table. I asked the waitress and she said that she didn't take my number, she placed us down the priority chain and said wait another 15 minutes. We weren't seated until 12:40pm and kept seeing bigger groups who came after us getting tables ahead of us.   Our server didn't come ask us for beverages for a good ten minutes. Food took ages to come out.   Food was decent, nothing groundbreaking. The poor service brought the whole group's mood down that the meal was very negative.   Won't come back."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I both arrived famished, and both left completely satisfied. Tasty burgers cooked exactly the way we asked and their garlic truffle fries were also delicious. It was convenient for us to go for dinner prior to our show for Jeff Dunham and we are glad we did!"}
{"text":"We has just arrived in Las Vegas after a long travel day and needed a solid dinner.   We were not disappointed at Gordon Ramsy's.  We had the burger, which was cooked perfectly and the sheppards pie which was excellent.  We started with a lobster roll which set the tone as it was also very good.  Busy atmosphere but the waitstaff was attentive and friendly and the beer selection was tasty.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow... I love burgers and I love this place. It was a cool atmosphere and the staff is really nice and friendly the do have a wait most of the time. My wife and I shared the truffle fries one serving is totally enough for both of us. The prices were not bad at all for a Gordon Ramsey place!! Both the burgers we had here amazing my wife had the farm burger and I had the burger with the goat cheese.... I forget the name but it was amazing!!! Will definitely be go back here!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My boyfriend and I saw this restaurant featured on GR's masterchef and decided to try it when we went to Vegas. We went about a week ago and were definitely pleased! The decor is really modern and the fire wall thing is pretty cool. I'm a vegetarian, the earth burger seemed a little blah. Our waiter, Mike, who by the way was awesome let me get the Hell's Kitchen burger with the portobello burger. The burger was amazing! Tons of flavor. The onion ring were some of the best I've ever had. My boyfriend had a shake, which was delicious and the farm burger which he also said was one of the best burgers he's ever had. The prices aren't to high considering its Vegas where a slice of pizza costs more than $10. Definitely a must try when you go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I had researched this restaurant prior to visiting Las Vegas. And I must say it was exactly what I hoped it would be. I had the Euro burger which was phenomenal! They had 30 different beers on tap. And the drink menu was on an iPad. We started off with the truffle fries, Maui onion rings, and jalapeño poppers. Best appetizers by far. I had two servers who were outstanding which us why we left a very generous tip. The set up of the place is also very cool. I definitely recommend this place and wish there was one in Sacramento."}
{"text":"I'm a major Gordon Ramsay fangirl...and one of my life's ultimate goals is to try EVERY possible Gordon Ramsay restaurant on the PLANET--and Mars if we were happen to get there and GR opens a restaurant there.  Anyways, I've been to Las Vegas a fair share of times and I've always wanted to try BurGR...and I had my lucky chance finally last spring. Generally the wait is RIDICULOUS come lunch time if you don't have a reservation...so if you want to come for lunch, make sure you call in for a reservation beforehand!  My friends and I came here a little bit after they opened in the late morning, so we didn't have to wait too long for a table. We ordered:  (1) Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings  (2) Honey-Pig Bao Buns  (3) Farm Burger (4) Southern Yardbird Burger  Now, the onion rings were off the hook delicious! The Bao Buns were like mini-pork steam buns (for you food truck lovers in SF, they're similar to Chairman Bao's steamed pork buns). The farm burger had that gorgeous fried egg with the oozing yolk (YUM). The Yardbird was eh.  Now, this is Las Vegas and it's a GR restaurant...so don' expect this place to be cheap. Each burger is about $12-16. While the burgers weren't \"blow your mind you have to try this every time you come to Vegas\" quality, it was still very tasty.   The layout of the restaurant opens up to the casino area of Planet Hollywood, which is nice...and it's far enough from the casino that you're not entirely experiencing second smoking while you eat.  The only gripe I had about this place was the SERVICE. The service was TERRIBLE here...and I was really surprised given that this was a GR restaurant...and efficient and impeccable service is what GR prides himself in. I remember that our waiter forgot our order multiple times....and would disappear for a long time after we had asked him to check on our food. We probably spent about 45 minutes to an hour just waiting for our food...and we had to ask about 4-5 times about our food. Had the service been much better, I would have given this place a solid 4-star."}
{"text":"I mean it wasnt the most amazing burger I had but it was great quality. I'm glad he chose this hotel for this concept though cause it fits in well."}
{"text":"Waited about an hour to sit down at this place and expecting something amazing. The wait even took around 30-40 minutes to get our burgers and fries as soon as we ordered.  I got the all american burger and expected a really good cheeseburger. The meat party wasn't even juicy. The one thing they got right about the patty was that they cooked it medium well for me.  I mean, I wouldn't come back to this place again. A lot of people probably come here just for the name. Just wasn't satisfied"}
{"text":"My wife and I are Gordon Fans especially me.  I had to try one of his places and since we love burgers, have been to a ton of burger places so we have a legit vantage point.  If we are traveling you can bet we are probably hitting \"The burger place\" in town.  I can't say I had huge expectations for BurGR so I felt it was pretty good but not anything special.  For Vegas and the price it's not a bad deal, but I can't see myself going back.  I am not being called to return.  We had the Farm burger and we split it since we were already stuffed.  ***Background*** we decided this trip twas going to be more about eating out.  Anyways try it if you like, if you do, get Nicole (sweet and very easy on the eyes).  Cool!"}
{"text":"One Sentence: Do not eat here unless you are ready to give up your favorite burger. Too bad we don't have one in the San Fernando Valley.   The wait was not as long as some mention here, but it was long.   The waitress \"Amanda\" was simply awesome in every way a waitress can be. She knew every part of the menu and helped us find the right burger. She even helped with my beer selection and it was perfect. I wanted something similar to Blue Moon, but more on the IPA side. Too bad I cannot remember its name.   I recommend the Pork Belly appetizer (Honey-Pig Bao Buns), but the flatbread it came in was a bit too thick and soft. Order 1 order of Fries for every 2 people, even though 2 of us (big eaters) did not finish it.  The burger was simply cooked to perfection (medium). It is the only one on the menu with mushrooms - hold the cheese (Chanterelle Burger). At first I was a bit disappointed it only had a few mushrooms, but upon tasting this perfection of a burger, I knew why! I will call it meat-to-flavor ratio. Any more Sweet onion sauce or mushrooms and it would have overpowered the meat. This appeared to be high quality ground steak."}
{"text":"Of course you have to make a point to try Gordon Ramsay's burger joint when you are in Vegas. My standards were set very high when I dined at this place since it was Gordon Ramsay's restaurant. My burger was good and prepared well, I wish fries were included or small salads as the burgers are pricey. I really enjoyed the soba noddle salad. Overall the burgers were good but I felt it could have been better... maybe my expectations of this place were through the roof. Overall it's was a good dining experience would wouldn't hesitate to try it again."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, but awful timing. The server kept stating our food was on its way when we questioned her about how long the food was taking. Forty five minutes later our food started being served to our party. We had 3 people missing food and one of our appetizers were brought to our table. Not to mention we were missing appetizers, burgers, and the fries to complement our meal. We had another conversation with our server... we found out that one of the burgers we ordered wasn't \"ordered\" more like not noted. We stated the service was disappointing because not all the people in our party had their meal, our appetizers were served at the same time as our meal or either missing and all our fries were missing. Our server apologized and stated she would send the manager.   People in my party were starving and ended up splitting a burger with each other because they didn't feel like waiting another 50 minutes to get the burger that they ordered. The missing meals were served minutes later, our fries finally arrived. 5 minutes later the last appetizer arrived with the manager. The manager heard our complaints and was very professional.   The manager didn't charge us the cost of the fries, appetizers, and offered to treat us for dessert. No one in our party took her offer. After waiting so long you can't help to worry about how long that would take.  Worst service ever. The food was amazing, but the timing and service of our meal were executed poorly. I was really disheartened because I was so excited about eating at the Gordon kitchen for the first time. The service was unacceptable, especially if the restaurant wasn't packed. Wouldn't recommend eating here if you're starving."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The service was exceptional! If you are in Vegas you have to try this place! It's pricey but what do you expect at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I come every time I go to Vegas (which is often)."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 4 stars because the burger was impeccable, however if you want fries they force you to pay $8 for regular or $10 for truffle and there are way too many fries to eat. Wasteful.   What knocked it to a 3* was the service; it is horrendous. If you finish your beer you don't get an offer for another and it takes 10 minutes before you're even acknowledge and offered your first. If Ramsey was here everyone would be REEMED!!"}
{"text":"For my 100th review, who is more worthy than Gordon Ramsay king of cooking?  But unfortunately, as much as I wanted to love this place, I did not.  The wait was estimated to be an hour at 4pm. We were texted to notify us that our table was open at a mere 30 minutes later - a pleasant surprise. We had a lovely, down to earth, humorous waitstaff, and the atmosphere was really pleasant. It was not too huffy, they didn't mind that we brought in outside drinks, and the noise level was perfectly not too loud nor quiet.  Now onto the bad: the wait for our burger took nearly an hour. The burgers we ordered were decent - my farm burger was unfortunately cooked well done rather than medium as I had asked, and was very very salty. My companion's Hells Kitchen burger was very bland especially compared to mine, but at least cooked to a beautiful pink. The lack of consistency was surprising and disappointing. Further, the flavor of the burger was NOT outstanding. Halfway through my meal I put my burger down and was reluctant to pick it back up. There was nothing in the burger to really cut that greasy patty taste, and nothing to complement the flavors to bring out something more than just ground meat and bread. I'd much rather have had a burger from trusty old Hopdoddy's back in ATX or (cue salivation) the holy grail, Au Cheval, of Chicago.   For about $15 a burger, the price suggests I would be getting at least a culinarily delightful experience but alas that was not the case. I'll still love your forever, Gordon Ramsay, but I can't say I loved your burger.  PS. share the fries between 3-4 people, it's gigantic."}
{"text":"Wait was about an hour long for a group of people Hostess- main girl with the tattoos was impatient, the other girls were nice All the waiters were big buff guys- for you single ladies or in my case for my old lady  I got the hells kitchen burger- it was good got fries- it was good jalapenos poppers were also good  2 people be around $40 bucks for burgers  design as cool with the fire and stuff"}
{"text":"Was there this past weekend, wait for about an hour for a group of six  Service was excellent! Like honestly, our waitress was super friendly and nice I got the farm burger and shared Parmesan fries with my gf I got the farm burger with an over hard egg and it was great The fries were ehh alright, wish they were cheesier or something But the burger was amazing"}
{"text":"Very tasty and cool joint! Loved the overall look of the restaurant and their dishes. Cool vibe and cute presentation with their food. Overall fun spot to hit up when at vegas. I just wasn't in the mood for a burger so there wasn't too many other options, but I'm sure their burgers are amazing!!! I would have loved to try one. The jalapeño poppers r fun but SPICEY ! And the sweet potato fries are a little TOOOOO sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night, and waited about 20 min for a table (pretty reasonable, I think). Ordered the farm burger, because I love a good runny egg on my burger. The duck bacon was also a very nice and different touch! We ordered the sweet potato fries, the gooey fries and the onion rings. I'd say my favorites were the gooey fries and onion rings. We also ordered shots of the coffee patron & baileys: strong but good! The wait just to get the fries and onion rings took quite some time, but overall a pretty good experience!"}
{"text":"Burgers are OK. Service is horrible. Hostesses are mean, unfriendly. Line is long 30-45 mins."}
{"text":"Great place. Awesome atmosphere. Great wait staff. A-ma-zing food. The jalapeño poppers are not for the faint hearted. But so so good. Burgers were great. Fries were great. Well oiled machine. Would highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"Stayed in Primm for the weekend but HAD to drive into Vegas just to get a Burgr. We were here in January and had the absolute best burger in my life. We had to see if it was too good to be true so we came for a second time and like the first it was not a disappointment. The service today was top notch. Our server Matt Anderson was amazing and the perfect representation of Gordon Ramsey restaurants. Can't wait to be back from California for a 3rd time. See you in July!!"}
{"text":"The food here was amazing. I had the Euro Burger and Husband had Hells Kitchen Burger. We shared the truffle fries and had a couple beers. The food was delicious and filling. Only downfall and it wasn't their fault was a man sat next to us with his dog in his bag and I complained since I was trying to eat and highly allergic but the server did not resolve the issue or address it so instead of staying we went ahead and left.    Price: High but fair for on the strip Food: Delicious Service: Good"}
{"text":"Got in line, was told there would be an hour wait, hostess took our phone number and said we had to show up in 10 minutes when they called, and we could not wait in line!!  I guess that is great deceptive marketing to make it appear there is no line!!  Way to go Ramsay!!  No fear of any of us visiting your restaurants!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Gordan Ramsay, so I was super excited about trying this place out.  The line to be seated was LONG, but that made me even more excited.  It took about 45 minutes for my girlfriend and I to finally get seated.  Once we ordered, it took about another 45 minutes for the food to come out.  We were thinking at least it means the food was super fresh and made to order.  When we finally got the food, it was such a disappointment.  Both our burgers were bland and the fries were horrible.  Our server wasn't really friendly at all, we got a little attitude when asking for regular ketchup.  In the end, I'm still a Ramsay fan, I love his shows but I'll never come back here again."}
{"text":"Hands down, this was the best burger I've ever had. But, that's not even the best part! The fries and onion rings were simply incredible and the milkshakes? You have to get a milkshake. I have a bit of a sweet tooth and I'm known to put away from deserts from time-to-time, but never before have I had something to decadent and indulgent as those milkshakes. In fact, I loved them so much I ordered 2. Trust me when I say, you won't be disappointed if you get one. I talked all three people at my table into ordering them and they all left very satisfied with the recommendation."}
{"text":"I had the truffle onion rings and chicken sliders as an appetizer.  I had a couple of drinks: one was a whiskey cherry lemonade.  I also had the I had a blue moon gingerbread spiced ale, which made the onion rings taste better. I did not like the onion rings alone, only with ale.  For my meal, I ordered the britannica burger, which is a very sticky sandwich.  Be sure you have napkins if you order this burger. I ordered it medium rare and it was perfectly cooked.  On a side note, they do let you taste the beer before ordering, so if you are not sure about what to order, just ask for a taste.  The burger was good, but I would not order the appetizers again.  The truffle rings were not very crispy for a beer battered onion ring and the sliders were overcooked- the chicken was dry. I enjoyed the drinks and the burger- absolutely delicious. I will be back the next time I am in Vegas. I usually go once per year."}
{"text":"Both of us ended up with food poisoning that night. The night started off great. Great service and the food tasted amazing. We ordered onion rings, truffle fries, earth burger, uber cheese burger, & an oreo/creme brûlée shake. We didn't go out except for this restaurant so it had to be something we got that made us sick. We called the next day just to let them know and the manager couldn't care less."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of GR and just had to stop in when I was in Vegas for work. So glad I did! The jalapeno poppers for an appetizer, coupled with the spicy jalapeno burger hit the spot! The onion rings were fantastic too! My friend had the duck breast burger and the oreo and crème brulee shake - out of this world tasty!"}
{"text":"Bad experience. Ordered Hell's Kitchen, the farm burger, fries, and onion rings. Patty was over cooked and dry. French fries was not fresh they're were EXTREMELY dry. First experience was good, then the second time was the worst. DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"hmmm.. not sure what the hype is all about.    our burgers were a bit on the bland side.. which is fine.. but i think what made me upset was 2 burgers and a order of fries took foreverrrrr and not to mention the price.   im talkin close to an hour.  and it wasnt even thattt busy.  i know our tables next to us wasnt too happy about the wait either..  ok so... i mean,  you cant really mess up on a burger if you have nice quality meat... but where are my flavors?   we ordered the truffle burger ($21?) and special gordan burger..  and truffle fries.. hmmm it was ok.  their ketchup was good though lollll   our service was good.  all the waiters there are all very fit and buff lollll    i dont think i would come back.  but if i were to recommend maybe try something else on the menu besides burgers?"}
{"text":"Went in not knowing much about this place but was left in awe by their amazing burgers and fries and milkshake. The first thing to come out was the shake we ordered. The Oreo crime brûlée shake and it was so delicious we decided not to add the extra shot of alcohol we originally planned because we didn't want to ruin the awesome flavor! The truffle fries were so good they didn't need any condiments, but we couldn't resist using the curry ketchup and their other garlic white sauce. This was hands down the best meal in Vegas! I will definitely go back next time im in Vegas, it's a MUST!"}
{"text":"Gordon, you've done it again. This was the absolute best birthday dinner a girl could have asked for.  We arrived about 4:15pm on a Saturday, without a reservation.  Oops!  My mistake, I was supposed to call and make one, but didn't.  Luckily, my friends and I were not in a hurry.  It was my birthday dinner, and a thank you to my friend who does our taxes, so none of us had anywhere to be for a long time.   We stood in line to check in for about 6 minutes, before I noticed the sign that said \"check in with hostess first.\"   Another oops on my behalf.  I shouldn't go places when I'm tired.   So, the hostess checked me in, and said that they would send a text message to me when the table was ready, and let me know it would be probably an hour.  Awesome!  We don't have to stand in line the whole time.   So we head over to the Heart Bar...which ended up being a not so awesome experience, but I'll save that for their review.  anyway, I got a text message about 20 minutes later saying that our table was ready!      We were seated, and our server came over, and introduced herself, and showed us how to use the iPad menus.  We each got a cocktail, (and one beer for my non cocktail friend)...they were all delicious!!  Mine was the best though (to me anyway), I had the skinny screw.  I need to go back JUST for one of these.    A note about our server...I wish I remember her name, I think it was Nicole?  (pretty blonde girl)...She was a darling.  So nice, very accommodating, and extremely friendly.   She even wrote happy birthday on our check!  Appetizers: Jalapeno Poppers:  We had these served with the ranch on the side, since my fella is completely anti-ranch.  They were spicy and delicious!!!  I was so happy with these, and I don't really care for spicy food.   Onion Rings:  omg nom.  I love onion rings and these were perfect.    Burgers:  My fella and I had the farm burger, and the uber cheese burger, with duck bacon added to mine for $3 extra.  Totally worth it.  They were both amazing...the burger was a perfect mid-rare, the egg oozed out with yummy yolk, and my uber cheese burger was SO delicious!  The goat's cheese was my favorite.  So creamy and delightful!   I don't remember what the other 2 at the table had, I was too engrossed in my food.  Truffle fries:  Wow!  So delicious!  Dessert: Sticky toffee pudding push pops: Wowza!  While I will admit, I liked the pudding at the steak house better, you have to hand it to Gordon for not being a one-trick pony.  Changing up his classic dessert and layering it in a push pop was delicious, and had a feeling of whimsical child-like fun to it.  I loved it!  The crowning moment of this visit though, was that because it was my birthday, Christina (from Hell's Kitchen) who is the new executive chef, came over with our food to say hello, take a quick picture, and chat with me.  In fact...she mentioned that Gordon was going to be in town, and even checked her phone to find out what time!!  She was gracious, and amazing, and dealt with my star-struck silliness beautifully.  (I NEVER get star struck, but I was like a giddy school girl.)  All in all, the dining experience was incredible.  I can't wait to go back again!  Maybe I'll meet Gordon next time. ;)    Mr. Ramsay, you've got a perfect trio here in Vegas.  Amazing job."}
{"text":"AWESOME food. Burgers, truffle fries, and onion rings are amazing. Paul is a fantastic server. BurGR is by far the best burger place I've been to. BurGR totally met my expectations. Thanks Gordon Ramsay!"}
{"text":"Chanterelle Burger. That's all you need to know when you're going there. That burger by itself will get a good 5 stars rating. The fries, onion rings, salads, the service and the horrible waiting time and the high price are pushing the experience down towards the 2-3 stars area, but that wonderful burger saves the day. A classic 4 star"}
{"text":"I bad the farm burger with the egg over easy... it was so good.... and the duck breast bacon on tgere was to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is decent enough for what it is.  I can't give it 5 stars because the burger didn't blow me away and I can't give it 4 because it was overcooked for how I ordered it. I ordered medium-well and it arrived well done with no pink inside.    I went around 12 noon on a Monday and there was no wait at all to get a table.  The burger took about 20 minutes to come out after I ordered it.  The hostesses and waitstaff were very nice.    I ate the Hell's Kitchen burger which is asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, and and oven roasted tomato.  I liked this combination of ingredients and the burger was actually pretty moist considering it was well done.  We didn't get the truffle fries because the serving size is huge and there's no way we could have eaten all that in addition to our burgers.  They did look very tasty, though.  It would be nice if they had a small side order for $5-6 or something, instead of the 2000 calorie $11 size."}
{"text":"Does Burgr live up to the high expectations we've set for Gordon Ramsay? That would be a resounding YES!  My wife and I went to Burgr twice during our two night stay in Las Vegas, and loved it! Please try the Farm Burger and the Hells kitchen burger. The ingredients were fresh, sinful, and left my brain wanting more in spite of my full belly. I will be back."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot!  Do yourself a favor, sit at the bar and order the Hell's Kitchen Burger! The bartenders have great personality and work as a team so it is like having 3 waiters vs. one!  The burger is to die for and if you have room, get the Oreo shake, that thing is so good it should be illegal in all 50 states!"}
{"text":"The food here deserves 4 stars which is why this is my second visit here. The wait at 1 pm to get in was nominal. However the disappointment comes in the amount of time my husband and I spent waiting to split one burger. As good as it was it was not worth the hour wait. I thought the first trip here was just an anomaly as far as the wait time was concerned. Unfortunately this is still a problem and Mr. Ramsey needs to determine how to get his food out faster without sacrificing quality. I would expect he would have an issue with any restaurant that made him wait so long for one burger. I can here him yelling now!"}
{"text":"Everything was mediocre.  You are better off going to Burger bar or Carl's Jr. to fill your burger needs."}
{"text":"Short wait on the weekday we visited.  Interesting fare.  Tried the chicken burger with fries.  Was expecting a traditional chicken breast, but was surprised by an actual chicken patty.  Still very tasty with sweet pickles.  Fries were very good.  Came with two seasoned portions of ketchup.  One was curry and the other chipotle.  While they were both good, I leaned towards the chipotle version more.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend or go again when in town."}
{"text":"Pretty good! Limited options for a vegetarian however the singular option the \"Earth Burger\" was pretty impressive so I can't fault them too much! I'd recommend it! Just a little expensive."}
{"text":"Tip: Place your name at least 1.5 hours earlier than the time you anticipate eating here! The wait is long but worthwhile if you're a foodie and love burgers. We were a group of 4 and we placed our name down around 8pm and we weren't seated until around 9:30pm.  The food presentations here are pretty awesome. For appetizer, we ordered the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers, which were great - I just couldn't eat them because of how spicy they were! We also ordered the Truffle Fries, which were great fresh but awful as left-overs, as well as Onion Rings, which were downed quickly.   I'm more of a seafood lover, so I ordered the Fish & Crisp Sandwich, which was phenomenal. I was more than satisfied and the serving was so large that I went home with awesome left-overs, too!   My husband ordered the Chanterelle Burger and was more than happy about the food quality.  All in all, it was a nice dining experience and the atmosphere of the place is pretty cool - the fire is awesome!"}
{"text":"Now I'm not a Gordon Ramsay fan - haven't watched any of his shows. But all the hype and prestige made me unconsciously want to try out his restaurants. But I'm not willing to shell out that much for GR cuz after all to me he's no Michael Mina or Gerry Danko. So BurGR has the perfect price.  Saturday lunch, came here at 11:15am, no line at all. Food did take a while to come out, but the waitress was really nice so I didn't complain.  Food: truffle fries are a must! Farm burger is great too. I opted out the cheese. Caesar salad is mediocre. Don't get it here.  Overall it was a very nice dining experience."}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than 5 stars! The staff were very friendly, and helpful.  Very quick service.  I think the best service I've received in Vegas. The food is indescribable, because it is so phenomenal. The burgers were exploding with flavor.  The fries were awesome as well.  Each bite was like heaven in your mouth.  I've been here twice now, and will come back often.  I took my friend here recently for here birthday, and she is now a fan as well.   P.S. Do not go to or try Gordon Ramsay's Pub and Grill.  Horrible service and sub par food. Extremely disappointing! Especially after having been to Gordon Ramsay's burgers."}
{"text":"A visit to Vegas is not complete without visiting one of Ramsay's restaurants =P  The place was packed but there was no line.  Ordered euro burger, hell's kitchen burger and truffle parmesan fries.  I wanted to get its famous sticky toffee pudding too but I just had desserts at Jean Phillipe-Aria.  Truffle parmesan fries ($11.00): expensive but I didn't mind since it's delicious and the portion was generous.  I wish the fries were skinny fries but they were yum and topped with freshly grated parmesan on top.  Served with truffle aioli and housemade ketchup.  My only suggestion is to serve the fries with the cone facing sideways.  I was eating the parmesan and didn't realize my dining partner couldn't see the fresh parmesan.  They were generous with the truffle oil so I was actually in heaven =P   Euro burger ($15.00): truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, oven roasted tomato. The meat is fresh and they let me substitute the goat cheese to english sharp cheddar.  Too bad the meat is burnt so my burger is slightly bitter =(  I couldn't taste the truffle oil.  I thought about sending it back to the kitchen =P  Hell's kitchen burger ($14.00): honestly it wasn't that spicy.  Come on, you can make me cry like Hell's kitchen contestants.  It's not spicy enough to be called Hell's kitchen burger.  3.5 stars!!   Gordon Ramsay's BurGR is kinda yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"I've decided to try this place since an auntie of mine raved on and on about how good the burgers here were so I decided to finally give it a try.   Honestly, the establishment was kind of a disappointment. This is basically a \"famous\" version of Umami burgers (famous since Gordon Ramsay lmao). The pricing for a burger is $11-$18. Everything I tried was extremely greasy. I felt like everything was backed up inside me once I stepped out of the restaurant. The onion rings were extremely oily/greasy and the gooey fries were salty and greasy. When I took a bite out of the pork burger, it felt like i was chewing fat. It was just too heavy for me. The burger I got was the duck bacon which wasnt too greasy so I thought it was okay. However, these burgers were just a really greasy version of Umami burgers.. except they're in vegas.  For future reference, I'd share a burger with someone and if you want a shake, share that too. Pass on the gooey fries but if you do want to try fries, just get the truffle fries."}
{"text":"The burger tasted great! I got the hell's kitchen burger, which was a little spicy, but I assumed it was going to be spicier than it actually was. The meat was well prepared. With fries, soda, burger, tax+tip, my order alone came out to about $40 give or take because I wanted to go for the truffle fries, which are great. It's definitely over hyped and over priced for the burger, fries, and soda. I will still be willing to go over and try another burger on the menu, although I probably would not casually eat here since I feel like I get better burgers for that amount at other places."}
{"text":"Best burger I think I've ever had! I went all out and for the farm burger with the fried egg and duck bacon. Definitely not something I would normally try. It was amazing. Flavors worked so well together. Their truffle fries were delicious as well. Nice environment staff was very friendly. Good job Gordon Ramsay ;) I will be returning when I come back to the area!"}
{"text":"AMAZING x 10!!!  This has got to be the BEST burger I've ever eaten! I had the Brittania Burger with avocado, provolone cheese and a fried egg on top. I had the burger cooked medium and it just melted in my mouth. It took me a bit to eat the whole thing because it was sooooo juicy and sooooo flavorful that I just wanted to savor the flavors.  Needless to say, I ate the whole thing and wasn't full at all ... it's just the perfect size for a gourmet burger.  We also ordered the Jalapeno Poppers and the Truffle Parmesan Fries ... both a MUST try!  You definitely will be back for more!!!  Probably one of my favorite restaurants ... ANYWHERE!!! :) If you have a little bit of time, put your name on the list at the front, walk or shop around for a bit and they'll text you when your table's ready.  Well worth the wait!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Burgers were awesome! Tried the Hells Kitchen burger and it was amazing. Would have gave a 5 star rating but the burgers that we had were slightly over cooked  (but still juicy and great) and the expected a bit more from the french fries (they cost about $8).  Not too bad of a wait for a party of two on Memorial Day weekend, about 30 mins. Overall a great place, will be back!"}
{"text":"Hands  down the best burger I have ever had! Tried the hells kitchen burger, jalepeno poppers and french fries, was a bit too much but we wanted to taste everything and it was so so good!  The skinny cocktail was lovely and the service was outstanding.  This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"What more can I say but Gordon Ramsay.  The burger at this place is out of this world. If you're in Las Vegas, this is a must  place to go.  It's crowded but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"It literally took us 45 mins to get our burger and French fries. Did not enjoy the wait one bit, especially since we were starving.  Beer Battered Onion Rings ($19) The onion rings were huge - deep fried nicely, super crispy, and I liked how it was sprinkled in parmigiano-reggiano. It was slightly too oily and greasy for my liking. After a 2 pieces I felt like it was too much.  Hell's Kitchen Burger ($15) Knowing this was one of the popular burgers, I decided to give it a try. Came with asadero cheese, roasted jalapeños, avocado, oven roasted tomatoes and jalapeño pesto aioli. Surprisingly as spicy as the ingredients sounded, it wasn't spicy at all. The meat patty itself was really juicy, nicely grilled. The burger all together tasted good. But for some reason after a few bites half way into the burger I felt like it didn't taste that good anymore. The ingredients were rice, but overall the burger lacked flavor.  My friend ordered the Euro Burger ($16), which I did have a few bites out of. Nothing special. It wasn't as flavorful as the Hell's Kitchen burger.   Quite disappointed with this experience to be honest. My friend told me good things about this place on his last visit so I'm assuming it's a hit or miss."}
{"text":"We ordered the Euro, Hell's Kitchen and Earth burger all with the vegetarian, portobello patty.  Overall the burgers were all unique and tasty. The euro was my favorite because the goat cheese inside of it was a nice tangy, creamy addition. The Hell's Kitchen was pretty spicy. The Earth burger was kinda funky, not the best.  If you are vegetarian, this place has great options. However instead of getting the Earth burger, you should get a Euro burger with a portobello patty"}
{"text":"WATCH OUT FOR BUS BOY. It's amazing how a busboy can ruin an entire meal by taking your unfinished food if you look the other way. Burger and onion rings were delicious until removed with 1/3 remaining. I guess they want you in and out real quick!! Our entire experience was ruined."}
{"text":"I didn't get it. Food was overwhelmingly spicy and I do like spice just not THAT much. I liked the garlic aoli with the truffle fries; the fries themselves were good but didn't wow me (best truffle fries ever - Canlis in Seattle, WA). I didn't really like my burger, I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the meat wasn't really juicy and I was expecting more of a brioche bun. Meh, maybe I was expecting something completely different than what they were offering. Even the atmostphere felt cheap to me though, sticky yellow plastic placemats and dirty paper menus. Service was good. My friends also loved their food and the place but I wasn't feeling it. We were passing by, saw the line and got in it just in time at around 11am and they seated us within 20 minutes. Another fun thing is seeing all the kegs they have by the restaurant/casino/mall entrance."}
{"text":"It was pretty late, my ever hungry friend was.. well.. hungry. My slow metabolism was still content with the previous meal earlier in the day .. the one he called \"a snack\". I wasn't expecting much, seeing that this was a celebrity chef eatery in the middle of a casino. My last attempt eating at a celebrity chef establishment years ago left me disappointed, so my expectations weren't too high.  We were seating promptly and opened our menus. Mr Ramsay popped out. I think I hear him yell \"F#?K You can't cook!\" in my head. Pricing was reasonable, I was surprised the Burgrs weren't $20+ each.  Affordable, especially for the Strip. (We Miamians are used to overpriced food by the way)  Surprisingly my ever hungry friend only ordered a few things off the appetizer menu, not his usual entire front page of the menu. Just Jalepeno Poppers, and Fury chicken Wings and some shakes.  The Poppers were huge, full of cheese, and each had their own dipping sauce. I enjoyed them. The wings were OK, nothing out of this world. The shakes were pretty amazing. I was almost tempted to get one for myself.  I had a hard time deciding on what burger to get, but I eventually settled on the Uber Cheese Burgr. I didn't want anything too complicated, I was trying to keep myself from falling into a food coma. Everyone except my friend's wife ordered a burger, she went for a salad with chicken.  Ok, I'm exaggerating a little, but at this point into my Vegas trip I was fooded out.  Our food came out pretty quickly after our order, everything looked good including the salad. Unfortunately the chicken was too spicy for her.. We all had a bite, it was really really good. My Burgr was also very very good, much to my surprise. Don't get me wrong though, I don't question Mr. Ramsay's commitment to quality, but I know things can go awry when the master chef isn't in his kitchen. If you're on the strip, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"This time I tried the jalapeño poppers (4/5) & Farm Burgr (5/5) - so far this is my fav one.   All in all, everything is good here!"}
{"text":"Plain patty no seasoning.. Very disappointed. Waited long time for this and just plain."}
{"text":"I don't eat red meat but my boyfriend really wanted to try this restaurant and I saw they have a chicken burger so I agreed to try it.   The wait was a little crazy. We had to wait in line for 30 minutes to put our name on the wait list then had a 45 minute wait for a table.  I had decided on the chicken burger until the waiter told me that it was ground white and dark meat, which wasn't appetizing to me. I ordered the portobello burger instead with the truffle fries.   My burger wad good but not great. My boyfriend loved the burger he ordered. We both enjoyed the fries. Our waiter saw my boyfriend had a birthday boy pin on and bought him a free pushup pop dessert which was really nice of him.   I probably wouldn't eat here again just because the wait was so long and they didn't have what I really wanted to eat: a chicken breast burger. (You guys should really add that to the menu)"}
{"text":"I have to preface this review with- we eat rare burgers. like so rare it qualifies as tartar. We did not get rare rare burgers at BurGR (which surprises me on one hand because I have seen Gordon ream out chefs for not serving meat at the correct temperature, but doesn't surprise me on the other hand because I know that a lot of restaurants are afraid to do a true rare burger).When the hostess seated us she pointed out their merchandise (wtf I didn't know i was going through a gift shop on my way to the table). Waitresses need a new uniform. Period. Gordon, you miss the f+cking mark on attire. What are you thinking with this retro futuristic style of dress for your waitresses. Its almost to the point of offensive because of how short and low cut, distracting, the outfits are. I almost felt bad because our waitress, Crystal, was awesome but her boobs in my face was a little distracting. Crystal was great, she recommended some great drinks ( I did the skinny screw and hubs got a Guinness, the little Guinness shooter was his first choice but when he found out it was a tiny shot  sans actual Guinness he decided on just true Guinness). The ipad drink menu is weird, I almost thought the entire menu should be on it or something else- didn't seem like a good use of an ipad.   The husband got the farm burger- duck bacon and an egg, he liked the flavors a lot. The bun was good, the patty was a bit smaller than we are used to. We shared an order of sweet potato fries (without vanilla sugar) and it came with house made ketchup and a jalapeno mayo sauce. We felt that if you are going to say jalapeno you need to make it spicy. We almost asked for hot sauce. The house made ketchup is really good- very tomato-y.  I had the Choy Sui burger which has pork belly, carrots, radish, and cilantro. It was good, the flavors were there. The pork belly was a little chewy so it was hard to just take a bite of the burger and come out with all the flavors intended. Pulling fattiness out of your mouth is never becoming either.   The fries were cooked well, the waitress was a doll, but I will always have this experience in the back of my mind when I watch him scold chefs for overcooking meat. Getting a rare burger is hard, but we thought that of all places, BurGR could hit the mark. \"WOW,Wow wow wow \" as Gordon would say, this place needs to check itself that it isn't just riding on the popularity of it's name and is actually delivering. Burgers have NO sides, so I guess $15 for just a burger is a good price for the strip, but I am used to getting RARE burgers with fries or salad included for that much. Bottom line: If you love Gordon, go taste what he has to offer. If you are expecting a meal that shows you what Gordon does to other restaurants go to a different f=cking place. WOW, wow wow wow."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday and got seated right away. The hostess was super friendly and did their best with every request.  We ordered their pork belly bao bun as an appetizer and was blown away. It was juicy flavorful fatty pork inside a soft fluffy bun. Thinking about it creates drool right now.   For burgers we got the euro which has arugula and goat cheese and the hells kitchen burger which has jalapeño and a roasted tomato. We were really impressed with the harmony of flavors.  Very well paired and extremely delicious.   The burger patty was cooked perfectly. Pink center and juicy.   Also check out the staff. Besides everyone being ridiculously good looking,  they all worked like a well oiled machine. Super efficient and friendly. Will definitely return when in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this restaurant!! After traveling to London and trying his Maze Grill restaurant, I was excited to try this place; which I should have been.  The burgers are cooked to almost perfection, the fries are seasoned just right, and the sweet potato fries were full of flavor.  This is definitely a place everyone should try out."}
{"text":"Its been a year since i ate here with my family i gave a review about us eating here and seeing a strand of hair. A manager private message me and never replied back."}
{"text":"Excellent burger. Farm burger was VERY good. Place is super busy and you will have a wait to get a table, but it is worth the wait"}
{"text":"It's a really good burger, with well thought out combinations, but overall just good. However the truffle burger itself deserves 4 stars. I love sweet potato fries, but the vanilla sugar and sweet dipping sauce with the sweet potato fries are sweetness overload. They say shareable on the fries...but apparently I don't share well because I would have like more."}
{"text":"Burger crew meeting called to order on Sunday, May 22, 2016 at 12:45am (Burger Crew does Vegas/Burger Crew Founders' Birthday Bash).   Members in attendance: Angela d., Sumana S., Trevor Y., Wayne T. , and Dennis K.  I. Ordering Trevor and I ordered the American Burger - American cheese, butter lettuce, tomaato, pickle, and onion ($15). Sumana got the Hell's Kitchen Burger - asadero cheese, roasted jalapenos, avocado, oven roasted tomatoes, jalapeno pesto aioli ($15). Wayne got the Farm Burger - Duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, egg ($15). Dennis got the Euro Burger - Truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and oven roasted tomatoes ($16).  II. The burgers The burgers were nicely cooked in terms of doneness, but was noticeably missing a sear. The patty was a little soft, was not as juicy, but was seasoned nicely. The meat was bigger than the bun, which is a departure from what we're used to seeing! The burger was a bit too bready for us. For the toppings, I was not a fan of the bread and butter pickles they put on our burger. They were sweet and not nice and vinegar-y like I like my pickles, but Trevor LOVED them. Wayne liked his egg, but his bacon was not as bacon-y as regular bacon. Dennis liked the goat cheese on his burger; it wasn't overpowering like goat cheese can sometimes be. He wasn't a big fan of the arugula on his burger, but that's just a preference thing. Sumana mentioned that her burger wasn't as spicy as she thought it might be based on the description of ingredients. She also mentioned that the avocado was seasoned! A piece fell out and she ate it on her own and there was some sort of seasoning on it. Though this burger was pretty good, it was not memorable.  III. The fries No fries during this visit!  IV. Miscellaneous Burgr is inside Planet Hollywood. Our server Brittany was alright. They have an iPad with the drink menu, which was a little difficult to navigate. There is a pretty trendy vibe in the restaurant. They have an open kitchen so it's fun to watch they put the burgers up to the pass. We were in a pretty cozy booth that was u-shaped. There was a little wet spot in the booth when we arrived and it smelled a little weird.    V. Value Not very good. Everyone agreed the burger was a couple dollars more expensive than it should have been.  VI. The verdict We enjoyed, but not a memorable burger. The ratings: 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.8, 4.0.  Next burger crew meeting: Stripburger tomorrow after we check out of our hotel!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar as I was by myself. It took awhile for a server to acknowledge me but once she did I had above average service. I had the Euro burger which was pretty good. I had the onion rings per my servers suggestion. I didn't care for them at all. Too much batter and very greasy. I had them sent back and got regular fries instead which were just okay and a little dry or over cooked. I would try this once again with a larger group and not at the bar."}
{"text":"I am still fantasizing about those jalapeno poppers - wow, they were delicious. The first time they came out, however, they were still ice cold in the middle. Gordon wouldn't approve! The burgers were really, tasty. Our server was absolutely great. We will be back in Vegas soon, and are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and so worth the 1 1/2 hour wait.  The 3 in our party thought the food was amazing, waiter was wonderful and manager who stopped by was so friendly.  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas and I have already recommended it to family members."}
{"text":"It took us about 15 minutes to get in during the off season.  This place was unbearably loud. There is no soundproofing to speak out and no walls! This is inside Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino which may partly explain the big noise factor.  The burgers were good but not out of this world as you would expect with a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The sweet potato fries were delicious."}
{"text":"Not what it once was... First, i sat at the bar and the bartender didn't acknowledge me for at least 15 mins. So i asked the hostess to seat me with a server.. My server was OK, refills were coming so slow you'd think coca cola was in a drought. But i got them, eventually. I ordered the farm burger and just fries. The farm burger tasted great! The fries on the other hand, well they tasted like cardboard. I come to Vegas to play WSOP every year, and every year this is one of my two favorite stops. But i can tell they have let this place go a bit. Maybe GR needs to stop in and teach the fry guy how its done... And service needs improvement. I'll be back, but better see improvements or it may be the last time."}
{"text":"The Worst SLOWEST service everrrrrr!!! A total joke. Couldn't tell u much about the food because after coming in hungry & waiting OVER an HOUR for any food to come out we would've eaten anything!!  Oh & aren't the apps supposed to come out first ? They were about 20 minutes after our burgers.  Staying here but never again. Could've walked 20 minutes away & eaten sooner than we were served here. Blah!  * I took pix of food but won't even post them because after such a horrendous experience I can't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I now daydream about these burgers!  They are succulent, meaty, and perfectly seasoned.  The only reason I would give it less than 5 stars is because it has forever ruined burgers from any other place!  I noshed on the Brittania burger (sans bun - but absolutely no loss of flavor), truffle fries and a tasty cocktail to wash it down.  Honestly both times I have been I have ordered the same thing becuase it is so delicious.  The burger has mango chutney, sharp cheddar and argula.  The sweet of the chutney, the sharpness of the cheese and bitter argula all go so beautifully together.   Worth the wait.  Give them your name and number and go to the bar next door for a cocktail while you wait, I promise you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Burger is one of my favorite restaurants on the strip to have a BURGER! As usual excellent service, delicious food, and the restaurant has a very casual atmosphere to it."}
{"text":"The wait time was horrible, I'm. It talking about being seated but after placing our order. It was just my wife and I we order two burger and a side of sweet potato fries. It took about 1 hour for us to get our food. He burgers where great, amazing. Originally they got my burger wrong I wanted the Farm burger but didn't get it. I told the server that brought our order out that I order the farm burger the one with the egg, he replied with how was your server. I told him I didn't know his name it was a guy, he walked away then about 2 minutes later him comes back and said ok we making it for you. Both servers where very rude and seemed like they hated there job, the one that took our order wasn't as bad as the one that brought our food, he was way worse. Now to the sweet potato fries, they where not good. Old and cold probably because we waited an 1 hour for our burgers and they fries must have just been waiting under the heat lamp. I didn't brother to complain I was already upset about the wait and then my burger being wrong. On top of the servers poor attitude, I didn't want to deal with him again.  But over all the burgers where amazing and I will give them another try to see if it was just a bad day!"}
{"text":"I ordered the truffle parmesan fries, coffee milk shake and the Euro burger. As soon as the waiter brought out the fries, I noticed how limp and soggy they were. There were a faint truffle smell and delicious grated cheese on top. The aioli and ketchup were probably the best part about this item. But the fries themselves, gosh, I really really wish they were better!   The Euro burger wasn't bad although for $16 a burger, it should have been a lot better. And the coffee milk shake, I really enjoyed the light and less viscous part of it. Whatever they put on the top dark layer, it was too thick and sweet for me.  Maybe I should have gone to Gordon Ramsay's other restaurant at Ceasar's instead."}
{"text":"Ate here last night, and it was fantastic! Service was awesome, we sat at the kitchen bar area and got to see Christina, winner of Hell's Kitchen season 10! She talked to us and was really down to earth. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Fuck off - this is one of the best burger joints, ever.  Took a few friends and peers to BurGR for lunch. We had everything from the Euro Burger, Cheese Burger to the Hells Kitchen Burger.   Hells Kitchen by a mile. It is incredible.   I would also recommend ordering a ton of their wings, and a couple of baskets of Onion Rings. Forget the fries, they arent crispy, hot or worth it. Just order two Onion Rings - they are like the Wings and Burgers - delicious, crispy and hot.   A Las Vegas must-do for me."}
{"text":"First I should say I am not a fan of Mr. Ramsey.  While walking through Planet Hollywood from my so so Dinner at Striphouse, we walked by Burgr.   Looked so good we had to try it.   Came back the next night.  First, the place was packed.  It was 10:00 PM on a Saturday.   We saw two seats at the end of the counter and got in without a wait.   Service was prompt and really nice.  The staff--all of them really cared about making sure the experience was perfect.  We both ordered the All American Burger.   It did take a while for the food to come.  Since we were sitting at the bar, we saw all the tickets so this was just OK.  While at the bar, we got to talk to the staff , including the hard working Sous Chef Jackie.  If Gordon happens to read this ( yeah right), you really have a great employee.  She takes her job seriously and has fun at the same time.  (We are not related, I promise).   The alcohol menu comes on an iPad, but no matter he hard we tried, we could not find any porn on it.    Now for the food.  Best Burgr I have had in a long time.  The meat was great tasting---and I should know, as I do not use condiments.  Eating here really makes me want to try other Gordo Ramsey restaurants.    There are a lot of great places to eat in Vegas, and I would put this one on top as one to try."}
{"text":"They were so busy we opted to sit at the bar, we had front row seats to how they operate and all of the workers were hustling and cleaning as they go and serving food so quickly.  It was fun to watch, we had a manager come and greet us and other people every few minutes to check on us. Great service! I love being appreciated.  The burgers were excellent! I don't mind paying $15 for a burger if it is awesome. Too full for a dessert, the truffle fries were so filling.  Can't wait to go back and try other burgers, what a fun energetic place to go at night."}
{"text":"Great meal. Can't see psying $60 for 2 burgers  1 fry and 2 soft drinks with tip. But it was tasty."}
{"text":"Good was delicious! I asked for a well done burger, seemed like it was too well done. Burger was a little too dry but it was good! I got then Farm Burger with Duck Back and it was good! Also got the truffle fries and Carribean dream cocktail.  Filled me up! What a pre birthday celebration meal!!"}
{"text":"If Gordon Ramsay actually went to this place anonymously he would probably fire half of the staff.  If you're going to come up with a boring concept like \"burger\" and take out a vowel to make it sound cool then your food and your service better be pretty f'in good.  This place fails on so many levels and you could probably just start with the uniforms.  Just based on the uniforms I feel like whoever came up with the concept thought this place would be like a high end version of Hooters where all of the waitresses would be dressed in skin tight dresses that focus diners' attention away from the food they're eating.  That isn't a good sign if you're expecting something representative of the Gordon Ramsay stamp of culinary excellence.  After waiting for an hour or so to be seated we waited a fair amount of time to place an order and then waited another fairly long time to receive the food.  I would say from being seated to receiving food it took over 30 minutes, which for burgers and fries is completely absurd.  The $9 Oreo milkshake with crème bruleé pudding was of quality somewhere between Burger King and a nice local shake joint.  I've had far better $9 shakes so while it was good there was nothing special about it to make it a $9 shake.  At our table we ordered a euro, 2 Hell's kitchen, an uber cheeseburger, and some Parmesan truffle fries.  There is no kids menu which is to be expected in vegas but even at Pub 1842 they threw together a huge basket of chicken tenders and fries for $9 as a kids item!!  My table mates thought the burgers were pretty good.  Maybe I was irritable from waiting so long but the burger I had the day before at Pub 1842 was any times superior to the hell's kitchen.  The uber was ordered medium well and came out medium rare.  unless they are using all grass fed beef I don't see why it could be so hard to cook the red out.  the fries were ok.  again, nothing too memorable about these fries.  you could see baskets and baskets of them sitting under a heat lamp waiting for their counterparts and I don't think that's how a high end place should operate.  when you're paying $25+ for a burger and fries it had better be the most epic burger you've ever had.  I've had many impressive $16-$20 burgers living in park city so I can definitively say this restaurant is a gimmicky waste of time capitalizing only on Gordon Ramsey's fame and needs to go back and work on the basics.  try Michael Mina's pub 1842 instead, similar prices, much better value and food execution..."}
{"text":"good burger but a bit pricey. is it worth of trying, yes, just because it is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant but probably not enough for a second time."}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!!  Misc Items:  No reservations are taken, but the wait isn't too bad at this popular spot in Planet Hollywood.  Half hour wait in the line for 2's, if you are a larger party, you put your name/phone number in at front with hostess and they text you when tables are ready for your larger party.  Hostesses were friendly. Our server/waiter was great and went the extra mile for us.  Decor is trendy and casual, with a mix of booths, table and chair and some bar seating.  The chairs are large and comfy, but they do run a bit low to the ground, so that could bother men who are taller.  Tip for those men:  put in a request for a booth or bar seating.  Food:  The Maui Onion battered onion rings were delicious and the accompanying sauces of in-house-made ketchup and cheddar ranch were fresh and very tasty.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg&select=cJYK3ZE6nrEVFwuvTEL1DA  Plenty of burgers to satisfy, with quality meats and other items, the patties grilled, flame broiled with a terrific char taste and my special burger of the day, The Gordon Ramsay Burger, having a double thick cut bacon fried in duck fat and avocado added some extra oomph and it was so delicious, and the superior bun with both regular and black sesame seeds was great and held up well bite after bite!  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg&select=tQmUtMWXBaXWOE2qGDVQmA  My daughter being a shake-girl had to order the most popular (per our server) the Oreo shake with Creme Brûlée Pudding top!  The shake was whatever, too thin in my opinion but I like them extra thick.  Wait for it...that Creme Brûlée Pudding on top was to die for!!!  Wow just incredible and I could have eaten a bowl of just that! http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg&select=zW1ehko-nLstPGm5wjcuIg  Okay so I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, I think he is hot and sexy.  I still want to go to one of his finer dining establishments and taste some of those Michelin stars.  I'm also a huge fan of Hell's Kitchen and have watched every season.  What do you know but one of my top 3 winner faves is the executive chef at Gordon Ramsay Burgr.   Introducing Christina Wilson, winner of Hell's Kitchen Season 10 and of course she was there, running the pass and my server asked her if I could get a signed menu. She graciously accommodated and here it is:  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg Oh the excitement and she even took a pic with me later when I stopped back by at end of meal.  Yep it's not a good pic of me but I don't care I was so happy she took more time out to do it!  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=WGBpuJBQ1FqRTxM8J5BBHg&select=fzm8aBeG-O5Dfe-7k_1nTg  Would I go back?  Yes, LOVED IT!!!"}
{"text":"The wait here is very long even if you have a reservation. Everything is a la cart which can quickly rack your bill up. The food was amazing to say the least. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and was not disappointed! It had the perfect amount of spice. The fries were the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"line was down the hall and around the corner and they were still able to seat people withing 20min or less, food was great. real good drink menu and service was quick staff explained the menu very well will deff come back here everytime im in town"}
{"text":"\"meh\" pretty much sums it up!  My girlfriend and I ordered  the Fury Wings to start. They waitress described them to us and recommended them. Her description was off, they were cold, and surprisingly fatty. I'm not an anti fat person...I actually love me some good fat- but this was fat in that kind of jelly slug way.   We sent that back- instead we got the jalapeno poppers. Classic. Easy to make.  Apparently, they are not easy to make and have taste good. I'm not sure who tasted these and decided to put them on the menu, but the cheese filler is absolutely disgusting. I'm a huge cheese fan. To top it off, it's served in this shot glass full of nasty sauce so it's two different goopy nasty sauces that you don't even have an option to have on or off your popper. Only one popper of six I believe has the seeds inside. This is supposed to be the big prize! If I order poppers, chances are that I like spicy food. Quit robbing me of seeds I paid for. We absolutely sent those back.   We got the house burger (the one with avocado) and the mushroom burger. Both were ordered medium. One came out rare and the other well done. I know because we split the burgers in half to try them both. The flavor in the meat was good, but the inconsistency was disappointing.    We also had the truffle fries- they were somewhat good, but somewhat stale. They flavoring was nice, but texture was off.  The best thing I had at the restaurant was their bbq sauce... which didn't even look like bbq sauce. It tasted like horseradish mustard. It was yummy.  We waited 45 minutes to be called, and with the name attached to the restaurant I would expect much much more. With all of the places to eat in Vegas, I will not go back here. I may as well order food at a random bar in a shady hotel, not wait, and be equally full."}
{"text":"Didn't really wanna come due to the meh reviews, but went anyway just to say I tried it :p Shoulda believed the yelp reviews.. Hah.   Burgers were good, but didn't justify the $15 price tag. You can definitely find better burgers for $15. They were bland and lacked any special sort of flavor.   However! TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES. were AMAZING. and the aioli sauce it comes with... Also AMAZING.   We all agreed afterwards that we should have just shared our burgers and ordered more fries."}
{"text":"My friends and I went around 7pm and there was a line-up outside the restaurant and we were told it would be ~1 hour wait. Fortunately, they take down your phone number and text you when your table is almost ready, and we really only waited ~30 minutes.  Our server was really great when we asked him to give recommendations on the menu. We ordered the granny apple kale salad, euro burger, some berry cocktail drink. Food wasn't bad but I would say it didn't live up to the 'Gordon Ramsay' name. Burgers were probably more on the small side but still quite tasty. Salad was good but didn't really have much in it other than just greens, few VERY thin slices of apple and cheese, and barely-there salad dressing.   If you're at planet hollywood anyway and have time to spare, drop by, and try the food but I wouldn't plan your day around it."}
{"text":"inside planet hollywood (ph) near miracle mile shops...wait for tables for 2 is very long...separate wait for 3 to 4 is shorter...flaming rails behind glass to view while waiting...modern and streamlined interiors for maximized seating...folding menu for burgers, sandwiches, salad, hotdogs, fries and more....ipad menu for drinks...$1 dollar cheaper on almost everything for total rewards member and self a member...$7 beer....$4 soda with refills...hells kitchen burger $14...a picture perfect burger...cooked exactly to request...burger patty is quite thick and pretty, but dense and hard...bit too hard...overall a good pretty burger...$7 fries served in a large cone...thick cut and crisp...served with 2 ketchup sauces...spicy chipotle ketchup and a odd, but good curry ketchup...fish & chips sandwich $16 and quite massive...split bread similar to a lobster roll bread...enormous filet of battered and fried fish...mound of slaw and a mountain of shoestring fries on top...fork and knife type of sandwich and good...meals roughly $30 per person sharing fries and taking a drink....excellent attentive service and getting checked frequently...drinks refilled fast and furious..."}
{"text":"The service was fabulous. The ambience is warm and inviting. The burgers are big I shared with my husband. We have had much better burgers other places. This is a novelty place to go.  If you don't mind paying $19 for a burger and $8 for fries.  The sweet potato fries were good they sprinkled them with powdered sugar. We are from California and the Habit burger is much better and so is Eureka burgers in Claremont. You are basically buttering Gordon Ramsay's wallet."}
{"text":"The wait is very long but totally worth it! Best meal of my life. I went with my family of four and we each ordered a burger along with an order of Truffle Fries and Onion Rings. The four burgers were amazing and the fries and onion rings were the best I've ever had. The atmosphere was a lot of fun and did I mention the food was fantastic? MUST VISIT!"}
{"text":"Personally dislike the experience here. First, we were asked to stand in the line without telling an estimate wait time. Second, the waitress doesn't seem to be enjoying working here. Third, NEVER EVER tell the waiter/waitress that you want your dishes come at once. We waited for about 20-30 minutes to get our food. \"Normally\" other restaurant understands us that it means we don't care if the appetizer comes first or even the entree. Finally, I have had better burger at smash, red robin or in and out. A simple burger selling for $15+ is just way too pricy, probably because it has the face of a celebrity chef?"}
{"text":"First off, I'm a huge Gordon Ramsay fan. I have been wanting to try his restaurant for sometime. Initial atmosphere experience is great, the vibe and decor really match the branding. The service was top-notch. The waiters explained the dishes in detail. I had an off the item menu which is the Gordon Ramsay burger. ($19) It was as expected...delicious. The only reason I did not leave a 5 star review was because the fries were a bit dry and lacked some flavor. The jalapeño popper appetizers were also lackluster. All else was great, I'd definitely visit again.   Arrive right at opening to avoid long lines."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Vegas, but never got a chance to! I'm so glad I came here! It's such a fun place and the food was delicious! We had a really awesome waitress named Clark too! She really took her time to talk to us and was very helpful! The busser was super nice as well! Sorry I don't know your name, but he was apparently a 26 year old red head :D Lol!   So the very first thing I ordered was a shake! I got my own mixture: the creme brûlée pudding topping with a strawberry bottom! No regrets!!! Loved it! Worth it! You can't get a shake like this at Starbucks and you'll probably pay just as much if you buy it in the casino! Get a shake! You need it :D  We tried the onion rings, the truffle parmesan fries, and jalapeño poppers tonight! OMG the TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES... AMAZING! The truffle aioli is so amazing that I dipped my burger in it! Everything here should have truffle aioli on it! You should also get the jalapeño poppers too; love that they put it in individual shot glasses!   For my burger I got the Farmers Burger! It's good, but I think I loved my appetizers better honestly! The meat was so tender though! Just wish it was a little juicer!   Overall I'm happy! Presentation was beautiful and service was world class! I definitely will be coming again!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but one of our burgers was overcooked.  It takes FOREVER to get your food also."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant and we went up to the hostess because we had a group of 3. I thought that the wait time would be pretty long since they told us that the wait is around 20-30 minutes. But we end up getting seated after 10 minutes of waiting.    Other than that, the menu looked pretty cool and the limited amount of choices helped us know what we want to eat.   I ordered the all American burger and it was amazing when I took my first bite. The meat was very juicy and it seemed to fill me up. The waiters and waitresses were very nice and served us quickly."}
{"text":"Love the farm burger rare best burger in town! Service always on point thanks Gordon ramsay!"}
{"text":"CHANTERELLE Mushroom Burger with the fig-onion jam was to die for. The bun is well done and the meat is delicious good quality ground beef. The sweet jam combined with the meat and the mushrooms worked so well. *mouth salivates* I loved it! So much that I came here twice during my trip. For the same burger! The burger was reminiscent of my favorite burger, the magic shroom at the well-known Hopdoddy in Austin, TX if anyone has ever been.  TRUFFLE FRIES: enjoyable. Come with a friend and share. It was a good amount for two hungry people, if not too much. They can come out first if you please. For example, when you're drunk and starving and need sustenance, these fries are bae.  WAITRESS was fantastic. Super fun and accommodating to our table of drunkies post-Wet Republic. Thank you for keeping us well hydrated, chatting with us, and giving us nightlife recommendations.  WAIT: Group of 6 came around 5 on a Saturday and it was a two-hour wait. But we prevailed. The second time I came at 4PM on a Wednesday, my friend and I were seated immediately.  Also. LOL at the guy's outfits with the jeans with a swirly GR logo on the butt pocket."}
{"text":"Most amazing burger I have ever had ... Drinks were pricey and the wait was long but it was totally worth it"}
{"text":"Five star burger joint.   Absolutely loved the Britannia burger.   It was so delicious........it didn't even need ketchup.    I might take 1/2 star away for the lengthy service.  Since the show frowns on time from order to delivery of food.  If there was nothing to look at in Vegas.  It took a smidge long.  Gordon, you can cook for me anytime.    -and thank you to our sever.  I got a nice icecream cake pop for my birthday."}
{"text":"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I'm from L.A. and I gotta say I've tried alot of really great burgers, but I think the farm burger from here is my favorite!!! Also, shake #4 which is an oreo shake is by far the best shake I've had! BurGR has become a necessary stop every time I go to Vegas. I was just in Vegas this past weekend and stopped at BurGR yesterday and it was even better than I remembered. The jalapeno poppers, farm burger, and oreo shake were all delicious AND the prices are extremely reasonable, especially for Vegas. Our server was awesome and very attentive. The wait was an hour and a half, but I have to say it was definitely worth it. My friends and I just played roulette in the Planet Hollywood Casino while we waited to be conveniently texted once our table was ready. THIS IS A MUST WHEN IN VEGAS!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars but the service is a little lacking when compared to other GR locations, such as Pub and Grill at Ceasars. The wait staff isn't as personable and the hostesses are a complete joke. In fact the girl decided to get on her cell phone while I was standing there. Ugh like really just cause you put your phone in the storage under the desk and you kneel down doesn't mean I can't see it. The farm burger is the best I've had here. One thing I wish they had was normal ketchup. They have a house made ketchup and it just kinda weird lol. Still I like this place though I want to love it!"}
{"text":"I was taking a business trip to Vegas, so I wanted to make the best out of it by eating lunch somewhere iconic. BurGR had pretty good reviews. I knew there was going to be a wait, and I had time. I started standing in line around 1:00 PM. Apparently if you have a party of three or more, you need to inform the hostess before standing in line. There's plenty of time to peruse the menu and decide what you want to eat.  When I was finally seated, I ordered immediately. The waitress wasn't too into delivering top notch customer friendliness, just getting the job done because the restaurant was so busy and hectic. I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger, which was delicious! Not as spicy as I thought it would be. The time it took me to start waiting in line then get my food was about an hour. Not bad, I guess?  In terms of service, the hostess was nice, as was the bus boy. Perhaps I got a super uptight and busy waitress that was rushing me out of the restaurant. Anyways, food and service alone I thought was good overall. I don't think I would crave coming back here again, but it's definitely somewhere to check off your bucket list!"}
{"text":"Uber cheeseburger was the bomb.com  Hahahha.. This place was excellent. Short line. We opted to sit at the bar. Bartenders seem a bit quiet at first but the dialogue started coming around. They kept up with everyone's drinks and bar was clean. So no complaints.  Chef Ramsey did not disappoint. Rarely can I order a burger without substitution or addition of something. The uber cheeseburger was perfect the way it came. No changes needed.  My husband ate his whole burger which was no small task. I was defeated. We also ordered the gooey fries but they came a couple minutes after the burger. I had already stuffed my face ;( they did look amazing and tasted good but it was too much. I would suggest ordering this on its own or if you are sharing with a table. Or if your just a fat ass like us!!   Great burger joint. We left super satisfied. And it wasn't crazy expensive. Looking forward to trying his Steak restaurant tomorrow."}
{"text":"I religiously watch MasterChef, I had to eat at a Gordon Ramsay spot. You won't be disappointed. The burgers were amazing. The service was top notch and the best sweet potatoe fries I've ever had. They have iPads to give you to scroll through the dessert menu. Expect an 30min to an hour wait depending on the day. It is located inside of a Planet Hollywood. Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"Came here with my awesome group of friends and didn't even wait that long for 13 people. The atmosphere here is amazing, the food taste awesome and great service.   The menu is not that selective. My friend got the Hell's Kitchen burger and I got the farm burger. I got to admit the spicy kick in the Hell's Kitchen burger is what made it taste amazing. My farm burger (duck and bacon) was good too. The fries here were outstanding.  1. Hell's Kitchen burger comes with jalapeños and Avocado. The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The spicy kick made it pop!  2. The fsrm burger is full of flavor, you can taste the bacon and the duck. It's not to fatty nor grease and definitely hits the spot.  3. We got the jalapeno shooters, this was fun because there is one jalapeno stuffed with the spicy seeds. My friends all took and waited to see who was the special person. In the end, it was not me!  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 had a great time here.   The pork belly buns were amazing! They were full of flavor and had great texture.   The wings were great too. I didn't even notice the bleu cheese which is good because I don't like it.  Truffle fries were delicious, and the aioli was a plus. It was soo tasty. The ketchup was good too. That whole package was 5 stars haha.  I ordered the Farm burger, but unfortunately I was too drunk to recall how it was. I finished half of it so it must have been good.   I'm looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"For a restaurant with Gordon Ramsay's name, it was not as impressive as I thought it'd be. The floors were dirty, and nothing looked very well maintained. Decent burgers, but they didn't taste fresh or juicy. Truffle fries were ok but not very well seasoned. I'd shake it up a bit, but I think the bottom portion of the fries where all the seasoning is, is just unsalvageable.   Not a restaurant to rave about or even suggest going to if you're staying in Vegas."}
{"text":"The best BurGR in Vegas! The Burgers and milkshakes are amazing!!! Truly took me by surprise. By far the best I've had."}
{"text":"Excellent food; service iffy. First experience was informative and excellent; second was iffy; third--glad we'd been there before as server had a 'tude."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by craving a good burger. We came away impressed by our burgers. I had the Euro and not being the biggest fan of goat cheese, loved my choice. The beer selection is great and the staff are extremely knowledgeable. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Took a while to get seated. Atmosphere was a bit loud. Good beer selection. Ordered the Uber Cheese and was great. Service was good as well. I don't like big fries so that was the only bad thing other than the wait."}
{"text":"I was eating alone so chose to sit at the counter.  Alex, my waiter, was not only extremely knowledgeable about all the cocktails and food choices...he was one of the most entertaining characters ever!!!  All of his suggestions from the jalapeno margarita to the southern chicken burger were spot on.  Food was presented beautifully and tasted great.  I go to Vegas a few times a year and am always trying places I've never been...this will be one of the few I will frequent every trip now."}
{"text":"Good tasting Burger!  You an really taste the apple and alder wood the burgers are cooked on. It's a really pronounced taste with every bite.  Of course the line ups are crazy long but I was on my own and got a spot in front of the kitchen.  I can tell you that the kitchen works like a machine with every person having a specific job and they do not stray from that job and the amount of food that goes out is amazing from 1300-1500+ burgers a day. Amazing.   I face this a 4 star but it really should be around a 3.5 star for the only reason that the fries did stay a little too long under the heat lamps and weren't hot, hot like fries should be. And the only reason I mention this is because of the caliber of the restaurant and the name! When you pay $15 for a burger and $8 for fries they should be hot.   Overall a good place to try because you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"don't let that line discourage you. we got in line where the rope seating hostess said approx 20 mins and it didn't too long before we got our table."}
{"text":"Not impressed - seems more like a tourist attraction rather then a restaurant.  Food was so so. My burger was medium well, but it was way to dry and way too much meat in proportion to everything else. Not a good balance.  if you want to experience Gordon Ramsey food and great atmosphere go to his Pub and Grille at Caesars Palace or Steak at Paris."}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about really! Come on people, it's VEGAS! We're here to have a good time right? Ok so, let's see here...  FOOD: DELICIOUS! BEST LITTLE DAMN BURGER I've ever had! PRICE: Little may be the burger but, BIG is the price, not too bad though ;) SERVICE: FRIENDLY & PRO BIG FAN: of CHEF RAMSAY!!! PICTURE SPOT: In front of the restaurant were FLAMES!   I will be back, back, BACK!"}
{"text":"Had two great burgers - didn't want to wait in line so I called ahead and picked it up when they texted me. We got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and I added an egg on it, and the Chantarelle burger. Both were astoundingly delicious. Not as greasy as I imagined it - a very clean, healthy flavor with top notch veggies. Looked and tasted delicious. The EGG is the way to go! I'd definitely go back and get the Hell's Kitchen Burger with egg again!"}
{"text":"Get the farm burger and truffle fries! ------------/-------------  After dropping some serious coinage at Encore beach club (see accompanying review), we decided to find a restaurant on the Strip that wouldn't break the bank, but also wasn't Subway.   I found this place on Yelp and they did not steer me wrong!  First things first - it is located inside Planet Hollywood. So if you enter from the Miracle Mile shops on Las Vegas Blvd, be prepared to walk across the casino floor.  Also, be aware that the line is only for party of two. If you have a group larger than that, YOU DO NOT NEED TO WAIT IN LINE. Just simply go to the hostess, and give her your cellphone number. She will text you when table is ready.   As for the food: - pork belly Bao: the pork was closer to Chinese Char Siu (firm, not tender). Soft & sweet bun, like those you get when you eat Peking duck.  - farm burger: GET THIS. This is a perfectly cooked burger (medium = medium), with a soft potato-type roll, toasted bun, and topped with a fried egg with a yolk that runs with the first bite. Awesome burger.  - truffle fries: double fried steak fried topped with Parmesan cheese and served with two sauces--an aioli as well as a near ketchup. The best part is the Bloody Mary mix that serves the base of this sauce.   Strong work, Mr. Ramsay!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've eaten here and both times it was great. This time I ordered the Brit burger and my boyfriend had the Hell's Kitchen burger. We also split the jalapeño poppers.  The poppers were very good--crispy and spicy. Actually a little too spicy; I had my soda refilled twice while eating. My only gripe was that I wish the waiter told us what the sauce was. It was already dipped it so we ended up cutting all of them in half so I could have ranch-less jalapeño poppers.  Now the burgers were perfect. My Brit burger was cooked the way I wanted and the mango chutney was delicious. The bun was even better this time around. My boyfriend's Hell's Kitchen burger was great, too. Cooked to order, balanced, and the avocado tasted very fresh. The spiciness of the roasted jalapeño went very well with the cheese. He said he'd definitely order this again."}
{"text":"Not good anymore.  It's ridiculous how the quality has declined. Every time me and my husband dine here, it gets worse. Today is the last time I spend money at this establishment. The burger was noticeably smaller.  Prior to today, I wouldn't be able to take a full bite from my husbands farm burger but now I can no problem and it isn't tasty. My \"über\" cheese burger lacked cheese, ironically. My husbands cocktail felt rushed and basic, unlike before, where it was complex and delicious. We sent our wings and poppers back because the wings were clearly burnt and the poppers were over cooked and tasteless. The waiter took only the wings off of our bill. It just didn't have the same touch. Farewell burgr, I won't be spending another dime dining at this now mediocre restaurant."}
{"text":"Loved the food quality! Great service as well! I had a Hells Kitchen burger and my husband had an American burger, we loved our food. If you are in Vegas it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Now I've eaten at all three Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Vegas.  I put BurGR at the bottom of that list with Gordon Ramsay Steak inside Paris as one of the best restaurants in Vegas period.  I've had better burgers at other places so I'm not completely wow'd by Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  The line to get a table was an hour wait...not worth waiting for in my opinion.  However, if there's free seating at the bar - take it, and grab a bite.  One of our bartenders was Senia.  She was cute, perky and easy to talk to.  She definitely made the beer and burger taste better so kudos to GR for hiring some great help otherwise BurGR would get just 3 stars.  I got the Hell's Kitchen burger which was good but a little dry.  My wife's Farm burger was much better.  The egg moistens the burger and gives it that extra something special.  Make sure to get the truffle fries...which were awesome.  The restaurant sits at the front entrance to Planet Hollywood...easy to find.  The flaming signage is one of the best signs for anything I've ever seen.  Very cool."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat at the bar/counter. The staff behind the bar looked at me no less than ten times in about ten minutes. I was not greeted, provided a menu, asked for my drink order, etc. So I got up and left. By the way, it was a week night and not busy. With an abundance of over priced burger joints in Vegas, this place stands out for BAD service."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday night and ordered  1 Oreo shake 9 2. Chicken sliders, 12 3. Hell's kitchen burgr 14 4. Truffle parmesan fires 11 for $58  - The GR in BurGR is Gordon Ramsey! HAHA. It's not a typo. LOL. ok ok, I know u know that.  -  We came to eat here around 11pm, which was great timing because the wait time was roughly 15min. How it worked for us was that we had to talk to the hostess so that we can make the reservation. I gave her my number, and then she said that she will text us. I got the text in 10min, then had to wait in line next to the fire display for 5min. I thought that was pretty efficient. It gave me some time to scope the tables, haha! Although I hate playing blackjack in PH, horrible odds, unless you play high limit, but that is besides the point.  - Anyway, we got seated in between a couple and a group of 4, which almost seemed like too close for comfort, but was alright. Neither group was loud and annoying if you know what I mean. Haha - The waitress started us off by showing their drink menu on an iPad which I thought was pretty amazing. We did get the Oreo shake which was so delicious! I would definitely get it again, or maybe, if they could, just get it to-go! It was that good. Haha. It's a mixture of oreo and on top was creme brûlée. Amazing. Plus, it was served with a boba straw. lol.  - The sliders were alright. I wasn't too impress. It almost had a hint of Asian flavor. It did look cute though.  - The presentation of the Hell's kitchen burgr was great. I noticed that it didn't come with lettuce and the bun had black sesame seeds on it. The hamburger meat tasted very juicy! Cooked medium. Excellent! If only it was bigger. Best burger I have eaten in a long time.  - The truffle parmesan fries were also very good. Try to eat them all there because we took it home, and tried to re-bake it to get the crisp back, but without success, it did not taste as good. But the sauces are fantastic. Dip again and again.  - Although the price was pretty steep for something typical as burger and fries, they made the experience pretty memorable. $60? That's like 5 #2 at in-n-out!!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay definitely doesn't disappoint with his menu, that's for sure. I had one of the chicken burgers and we shared a creme brulee oreo milkshake, which might have been one of the best desserts - let alone milkshakes - i've ever had. The burger was also amazing -- I've never had chicken so juicy on a bun before.   Also loved the waitstaff -- we weren't super hungry but needed to eat before our flight, so they were accommodating with splitting our meal without an attitude...and they kept our waters filled!!  Only downside is Burgr doesn't take reservations, so you have to stand in line for about a half hour to get a table for 2, but it's SOOOO worth it. You really can't visit Vegas without having lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"What can I say? I love burgers.. I love them so very very much and, for me, an amazing burger can be (what's the word I'm looking for?) orgasmic.. I really like Gordon Ramsay as well so I was really looking forward to eating at the Gordon Ramsay BurGR.  Tell you what? I wasn't disappointed. I really like the place. The decor and setup work really well together, It's got bright and vibrant colours, it's modern and the bar area is a nice touch  and contributes to the relaxed atmosphere. Our waitress very friendly and nice..  I had the Euro Burger w/ Truffle Parmesan Fries and my mate had the Farm burger - simply amazing. Those fries are awesome!  I had 2 other mates who also tried the roasted jalapeno poppers and they're still raving about them today so that says things...  I highly recommend it but be prepared to wait.. I think we ended up waiting about 20 mins or so but it's worth it..."}
{"text":"Be ready to wait a long time to be seated. But if you have hotel status....be ready to eat very soon.  The burger was delicious. Treat yourself to a fried egg on your burger, you won't regret it.   Then go gamble more."}
{"text":"Since my BF is a huge Gordan Ramsay fan, we decided to grab a bite here during our Vegas trip. We got here around noon and it didn't take long for us to be seated. Upon being seated, I was immediately shocked by the customer service. The host was extremely kind and welcoming. Once seated, our waiter was also genuinely nice and informative. He walked us detail by detail through the menu and gave us great suggestions. Obviously, 5 stars for the service!  Anyways, now onto the food. Two words: TRUFFLE FRIES!! ($11) These fries were the best fries ever, hands down! They were thick cut fries and worth every penny.   As for the burgers, I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($14) medium rare. Spicy, juicy and soooo good that I finished the entire thing. I forgot what my BF ordered but he liked his burger too!  Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I went here for late lunch.  Since I love truffles and I love fries - I had to try the truffle parmesan fries.  There was a line even at 2pm and I was in a hurry.  I didn't make a reservation - who eats at 2pm?  Apparently, 60 other people do!  Good thing a spot opened up at the bar and I wasn't picky as to where I sit, I just want food in my belly!  I had a medium rare Euro burger (truffle aioli, arugula, goat cheese and oven-roasted tomato) and truffle parmesan fries.  The guy at the bar who took my order said that 1 order of truffle fries was good enough to share - he doesn't know me and how big my appetite is.  I also got a Farm burger (double patty, duck breast bacon, fried egg and cheddar).  After 25 minutes, my food came.  My Euro burger was cooked perfectly, juicy and absolutely delish!  The tangy tomato and peppery arugula were a good balance to offset the thick creaminess of the goat cheese and the fatty beef patty.  The Farm burger was real meaty - I'd have a heart attack if I ate the whole thing!   The Parmesan Truffle Fries were good.  The amount of truffle dipping sauce was pretty generous and also comes with homemade ketchup.  The flavor was fantastic without a doubt but I would've loved the fries to be more crisp.  I finished the fries though.  Next time I come back, I'll probably have the same stuff and try the chocolate hazelnut shake/ dessert."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a few years and now we stayed at Planet Hollywood in Vegas so I had the chance. At night, there's a long wait to be seated, so we waited until the place opened for lunch and the wait was minimal.  The service was outstanding. Very inviting and helpful. The waiter dropped alot of knowledge on Gordon Ramsey's shows, but he didn't shove it down our throats.   I ordered the Pork Belly Hot Pockets for an appetizer, which was pricey at $12 since it was only two small hot pockets. But they melted in my mouth. Amazing. For my entree, I ordered the Farm Burger. It took alot of time before we got our burgers, which my friend complained about. But I told him, \"Hey, this ain't McDonald's.\" When we finally got our burgers, they looked amazing. I cut mine in half and they egg yolk oozed right through.  I can honestly say, it was the best burger I've ever had in my life, hands down.   I would highly recommend this place. Yes, the wait is substantial and it is expensive, but not really for Vegas."}
{"text":"As I was walking into Planet Hollywood I noticed a long line at Gordon Ramsay Burger and thought noway am I waiting in that line for a burger. The line wait was 45 minutes long but THE BAR was EMPTY. So I ask the host if its okay if we sit there and she said yes. I got the same food as everyone waiting in line with much better service. The bartender/waiter was great.   I had the Farm Burger with Truffle Parmesan Fries and my girlfriend had the Hells Kitchen Burger with Beer Battered Onion Rings. We also had some cocktails that the bartender made to perfection (with lots of alcohol ;) . Everything about our visit to Gordon Ramsay Burger was phenomenal. Food and service were both great.  Next time your in Vegas and want a good burger, this is the place to go! Just remember to look for seating at the bar if you don't have the patience to wait in line for over 30 minutes. 5 star for sure, best burgers I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. Love the Hell's Kitchen burger! The place is located inside Planet Hollywood. A must have if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I wouldn't think of trying this place if it weren't for my boyfriend. I'm not really a burger person, but hey, I was willing to try it because I wanted to see what it was all about.   No wait on a Wednesday afternoon - or at least nothing longer than ten minutes. There were plenty of tables available. Seated pretty quickly and looked through the menu. There were all sorts of gourmet burgers, appetizers, etc. I tried the Britannia burger which had sharp cheddar, mango chutney, and arugula. I also ordered it medium. My boyfriend ordered the Hell's Kitchen which was stuffed with roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, cheese, and oven roasted tomatoes. He got his medium rare. The overall presentation of the burger was fantastic.   I took my first bite and I really loved how perfectly toasted the bun was. It wasn't too crisp, but soft and puffy. It was just right. The mango chutney gave the meat a little bit of a sweetness too it which I liked. My burger wasn't overloaded with ingredients, but had the right balance of everything in it. Oh. And we were given forks and knives to eat our burgers, but who eats burgers like that...use your hands and get messy!   The parmesan truffle fries on the other hand were not to my liking. It could be because I don't like fries that are shaped as wedges, but I felt like they were overly crisp and had too much parmesan. The dipping sauces they provided were different - marinara sauce and some white creamy sauce that I don't know the name of. These fries are definitely overhyped...   Definitely definitely a place to try when you're in Vegas! I'd definitely come back again. The burgers don't disappoint. It was a little pricey at around $15 a burger, but compared to other burger places like Red Robin (where burgers average to about $9-12) this was far better and totally worth my money.   P.S. Lines can get super long so choose your timing wisely!"}
{"text":"Whoever came up with the esthetic concept of this restaurant needs to take it down a notch or twelve.  I can't imagine that Gordon Ramsay REALLY wanted his name and face on literally every printable surface.  Sure, the guy has a reputation in the business for having kind of an ego, but this is a little much, even for Vegas.    Dude does a good burger, even if my medium-rare order came out medium (hence, minus 1 star).  Kelp Caesar salad was also very good.  The fries were so crispy that a few were actually kind of hard to chew, and the portions are definitely generous here.    Good service, uuuuuugly uniforms.  Ramsay, if you're reading this, fire the design team."}
{"text":"I was happy about the text notification when our table was ready (for larger parties).  I ordered my burger medium and it came back with the center nearly raw.  I felt like one of the patrons on his many tv shows that had their dinner sent back! haha.  Service was slow, and our waitress really didn't want to be at work that day apparently.  I won't bother coming again but I'll still watch his shows.  2 stars because I like Gordon Ramsey."}
{"text":"Good burger and great drinks.  Everything you want from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.  It was a great start to our trip."}
{"text":"Positives first since there are fewer  1. Wait was short (10 minutes) 2. Greeter was very nice  3. My burger was amazing, as were my fries  Negatives 1. Waitress barely made eye contact and didn't let me finish ordering before asking my husband what he wanted, cut me off mid order 2. Waitress didn't check on us other than when we asked her over 3. My husband ordered a medium well burger and received a bloody mess 4. Our waitress seemed quite put out when this was brought to her attention 5. I got my burger and was almost finished by the time my husband's was re-made 6. Not a single apology. No visit from the manager expressing concern, nothing. Nobody cared."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place! Food was excellent! And Katie and Adam our servers made the experience even more enjoyable. Looking forward to coming back here next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night at 8.  Forget it.  Hour and half wait.    Came back Sunday evening at 5:30.  No wait.  Menu is very limited. We had two regular burgers, two chicken burgers, a regular fries, a Parmesan fries, and the wings.  Wings were good but very forgettable.  I'd skip if I go again. The chicken burgers were, per my wife and daughter, very \"eh\".  The regular burgers were good, but I did not care for the duck bacon at all.  The fries were very underwhelming.  Way too soft and just not great.  The place tries to be very gourmet but just didn't nail it."}
{"text":"Overall rating is more like 4.5 stars out of 5.  My wife and I absolutely enjoyed this place. She was telling me that she might even like this Gordon Ramsay establishment better than the Gordon Ramsay Steak.  This is just an all around great burger place.  Not to mention that the decor of this place was very intriguing. It was so intriguing that my wife took a few photos of the place.  I couldn't really find any issues with the place. Besides the 20 - 25 minute wait for our burgers after finishing our starter/appetizer of onion rings everything was pretty exceptional.  Our server was awesome. I don't remember the names of the burgers we ordered, but I do remember they were absolutely delicious. The onion rings were cooked to perfection and for extra deliciousness they actually add some Parmesan cheese on top. And although we ordered their simple fries they were seasoned well and tasted extremely good (If we are ever back in Vegas and at Gordon Ramsay, BurGR we plan on trying one of their other fries option).  All in all my wife and I enjoyed our experience here and feel that Gordon Ramsay BurGR is by far one of the better restaurants we attended while we were in Vegas.   I recommend this place to anyone looking to eat a tasty burger. This place has them."}
{"text":"Loved this place!   The wait was a bit long, but it was rush hour around lunchtime so it made sense. Around a 30 minute wait. Doesn't make a difference when you can walk around Planet Hollywood and shop for a bit.   Ordered the American burger and the Parmesan fries. DELICIOUS. Loved both and even though the burger is relatively small, it's still filling. Will definitely return one day."}
{"text":"This was definitely a Burgr experience I will not forget. Was it a bad experience?...Nooo! Not at all. Was a good experience?...Yesss!!! Jaime and Adam made it wonderful!! These 2 guys know how to keep their customers happy and their menu suggestions were on point!! I dare anyone to  challenge them about what to get on the menu...Lol!! (Just kidding, but they know their foods.)  Seriously though, the burgr was delicious! I had the Gordon Ramsey Burgr whch was very tasty. I also had the Truffle Parmesan Fries and they paired great with the Gordon Ramsey. I'm sure the other signature burgrs would pair great with the Truffle fries as well, so just be sure to ask for Jaime and Adam and they will steer you in the right direction.   As for any negative reviews...everybody will have their own opinion and their entitled to it, because not everybody can be a GR Burgr fan. But if you want to have a good time, enjoy your meal and be treated with respect and feel like you're their #1 customer...ask for Jaime & Adam!"}
{"text":"Not a huge burger fan, but a fan of GR. First time here, it didn't disappoint. Taste is 3-4 stars to me and extra star earned for the service, decor, and the experience. Several signature burgers to choose from. The chanterelle burger has figgy-onion jam with arugula. This pretty must sums my taste buds so it worked out. The patties tasted nothing more than beef with salt and pepper. I suppose the toppings make the burger. Decently sized.  Truffle parm fries were good, however, I found myself dipping the fries in the house ketchup more than the truffle aioli. Hmmm.   It's a cute, fun place to experience. You also get to keep the menus as souvenirs. Ramsey thought this one out..as I wanted to 5 finger discount it when I first saw it!  I wouldn't make it my first choice to come back here when in town. Then again, I'm not burger fan."}
{"text":"First time at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.  Have watched him for years rail against mediocrity and poor standards.  Huge line early on a Saturday evening.  First of all, didn't not like the chairs or the seating.  You are a burger joint and the furnishings look like they're out of a jetson's cartoon.  Trying to be cute and now I'm uncomfortable in my mini me chair looking up at my dining guests like I am six years old.  Of course ordered a burger, and am told it takes 25 minutes!  WTF???? Are leprechauns cooking them with minilighters?  Ordered fries and a shake as well.  Fries were okay and shake was good(but who can screw up a shake).  Burger came out and it was well cooked and tasty, but wasn't hot enough.  After twenty five minutes in an oven it should have been scalding.  I liked the mix of ground beef but could have done without the multicolored sesame seeds. Service was fine.  Glad I came, wouldn't come back, too many other selections in Vegas and the food just wasn't memorable enough for me."}
{"text":"Located at Planet Hollywood hotel and casino.  Entrance by Las Vegas strip.  Paper menus are designed so that you can keep one as a souvenir if you desire. The gourmet burgers have various names and combination of ingredients.   I chose the Farm Burger and hubby decided on the Gordon Ramsay burger which is not on the menu.  The Farm Burger is a cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg.  I'm a traditionalist so I removed the egg and gave it to hubby.  His Gordon Ramsay burger was too junky for me.  He liked it.  One of the Hell's Kitchen 10th season contestant winners runs the kitchen.  She wasn't there the day we ate there.   Cynthia is her name according to our server.  Juicy hot burger served on a sesame brioche bun.  The truffle Parmesan cheese fries were yummy too.  I like all the glass and fire in the restaurant.   After all, it's Hell's Kitchen.  I'd come again.   Pricey.   We charged the bill to our room."}
{"text":"Burgers were very good as were the fries.  We did however have to wait slightly over 30 min for our food.  Our food very well could have been ready a lot sooner because our server wasn't very attentive.  The place wasn't very busy as we went there to eat at 11am so it wasn't very acceptable for our food to take that long.  We also had the push pops for dessert which my girlfriend and I didn't really enjoy too much.  Overall my experience there was okay.  Burgers were about $13-$15 and fries were about $8....I would pass on those push pops though."}
{"text":"Great restaurant to eat tasty burgers! My favorite burger is turkey burger with spicy mayo and man he go cheese. I also recommend fish and chips sandwich. Taylor is a wonderful waiter who recommended to try the turkey burger."}
{"text":"Apparently Gordon Ramsay has 3 restaurants in vegas.. a steakhouse, pub, and burger joint.  I went because of him -_- yes he collaborates with the menu of course, but it wasn't spectacular. The decor and everything is perfect though. His name (and perhaps picture, ) is on EVERYTHING! Such a novelty.  Anyways, BurGR is located in Planet Hollywood, right near the front entrance on Las Vegas Blvd.    We ordered the truffel fries; they were too salty.  Lots of cheese (truffel cheese?), yes, but too salty!!  I was trying to mask the saltiness with the sweetness (-_-) of ketchup.    Also ordered a Hells Kitchen burger ($~13) -- (with grilled avocados, YUM) -- very flavorful.    Also ordered a Euro Burger ($~14)-- came with spring mix, so made it a bit healthier.  The buns have toasted sesame seeds on top and are VERY light and fluffy.  As you can see here: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=yo5BMXAk2QLOmAfQ9gG8xg#HaRwRn8XdJrX5efYl6oPVw.  The patty wasn't too seasoned though... so I asked for hot sauce lol.  The manager did stop by and ask how everything was going, that was nice.  In comparison to Umami burger, these are SO FILLING!  And gotta love the Hells Kitchen decor. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=yo5BMXAk2QLOmAfQ9gG8xg#yo5BMXAk2QLOmAfQ9gG8xg"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.   Farm burger and Hell's Kitchen were way legit!!   Truffle fries are bomb..   Ambiance is cool. Staff is pretty well mannered.   Super long wait time.. We got lucky with a 20 min wait. But as we left the line was very long.   Had an issue with credit from the room being comp'd $50 but everything else was fine"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service!! Really good food! Burger was seasoned well and sweet potato fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"After watching Gordon Ramsay on his shows, I had to come and try out this place myself. There was a line and we waited about under an hour. There's a huge menu outside; so it's good to get a glimpse of what they have to offer so you don't have to wait and waste time once you've got a table.  FISH AND CRISP SANDWICH- ale battered cod, salt and vinegar crisps, and fresh dill tartar sauce When I first saw it, it looked so good, but when I bit into it, it was bland and could've used more seasoning. The tartar sauce didn't do it much either. The cod tasted fresh, but lacked flavor. It had a nice crunch and consistency, but that was about it.  HELL'S KITCHEN BURGER- asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and oven roasted tomato I liked this burger. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. It tasted like a typical burger, but a burger done right. There were no bold flavors that stood out, but if you're craving for a burger then I would recommend this one because you got the melted cheese, the heat from the peppers, the creaminess from the avocado and the acidic juicy tomato all with the perfectly cooked patty.  CHANTERELLE BURGER- chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, and figgy-onion jam This burger was earthy. The mushrooms and the arugula were very pre-dominant in this burger. I didn't enjoy it too much. It was okay, but a bit strong for my taste. The burger itself was not dry, but could've used more seasoning or another flavor profile.  SWEET POTATO FRIES- vanilla powdered sugar, honey, and jalapeno mayo If you love sweet potatoes then these fries are for you! These fries had a nice outer crisp and sweetness to it because of the powdered sugar. The jalapeno mayo didn't add much heat to the fries, but there are different layers of sweetness.  BEER BATTERED MAUI ONION RINGS- parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, and cheddar ranch dip I did not like the onion rings at all. They were so dry and almost flavorless. It says they use beer batter, but I didn't taste anything. What a huge disappointment! The serving was huge, but after one bite, it was left the way it was.  TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES- hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, and truffle aioli You could really taste the truffles in these fries. They had such a strong taste and I love it! You could smell it and definitely taste it. Truffle has such a crisp taste, but if you only put a little in it's very subtle; so they must have put a butt load because it was so strong.  Overall, the burgers here were okay. I was expecting more flavors because of the price, but then again it is Vegas; so expect mediocre food for inflated prices."}
{"text":"Excellent experience!  Poppers were super tasty and the presentation echoes throughout the meal.  Sliders, wings and gooy fries, all fantastic!"}
{"text":"The burgers were good, but the real star in my opinion were the shakes. Pudding in the milkshake? Sounded odd but ended up being delicious! Service was pretty good too. Not a \"must have\" burger place, but fun place to have lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally tried a gordon ramsay restaurant! I had high hopes going here. My wife loved it, I thought it was just good. We ordered onion rings-I've had better at BLT burger at the mirage. And just fries- the name describes them, they are just fries. Nothing to special at all. Definitely not worth $7-8. I got the farm burger which was good for sure. Wife got the euro burger she loved it. And for dessert we split the creme Brule/oreo shake-this was the highlight of the meal by far.  The meal itself was really good, but not $70 (with tip) good. If this had been $30, even $40, I'd give it 5 stars. But that's what you get with gordon ramsay I guess."}
{"text":"Six ladies did some major damage here. 3.5 stars for a late afternoon linner.  I won't harp much on what's already been reviewed, so in short:  Truffle parmesan fries (X2 - thick cut, ample amounts of parmesan and truffle oil, and served with a side of ketchup and aioli).  Euro burger (X2) with goat cheese, arugula, and roasted tomato. The goat cheese melded surprisingly well with the beef patty and didn't overwhelm the senses. The texture of the cheese was particularly smooth. The patties in these burgers were well done, not my preference, but were cooked as requested.  Brittania burger (X2) with sharp cheddar and mango chutney. For those who like sweet and somewhat sour flavors that contrast (possibly in a good way) with the cheddar cheese. These patties were medium and medium rare, which came a bit more cooked than anticipated, but were well seasoned.  A third burger, the name which escapes me (also X2) had duck bacon (leaner than pork bacon but had the smell of duck fat thoroughly infused!) and a fried egg (made the burger look luxurious sitting prettily on the patty). The buns for these (as were the buns for the other burgers) were soft on the inside but not particularly toasted on the outside.  Chicken soba noodle salad, which I'll elaborate more on as it's not reviewed much, was surprisingly refreshing. (There was no edamame in this dish, although the menu stated otherwise.) There were thin strips of green onion intermixed within the noodle, crushed peanuts, sprinkled sesame seeds, thin strips of carrots, and a few slices of avocado all tossed in a honey-peanut dressing (more savory than sweet, which was to my liking) and plated with 2 skewers of sriracha marinated chicken. The chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful, the heat not too strong so it was just a faint taste of the sriracha. (Still flavorful but not for the purpose of giving you lots of heat). This dish was particularly fitting for that humid afternoon.  Sticky toffee pudding push up pops (X2) had 2 pops per order. The dessert was fun to eat (literally like a push up pop as the name suggests) and the flavors and textures were very well balanced by interlacing layers of toffee (sticky and more congealed) and cream (airy and soft).   While a worthwhile food adventure, the long wait and the fairly conservative play on the food probably won't be drawing me back any time too soon. But of course if ever in Vegas and in need of a burGR, you now have this on your radar."}
{"text":"Mr. Ramsay.. I've watched \"hells kitchen\" and absolutely love you. You whip people into shape and show them how real food is made. So when coming to your \"Burgr\" joint in Vegas I was extremely excited. I'm a man who enjoys a good burger with some fries on the side. Our server, Tammy was great! Super friendly and hospitable. I ordered \"The Hell's Kitchen\" burger and my other half ordered \"The southern yard burger\" as an appetizer we ordered piggies in a blanket which were delicious minus the half cold outside. Waiting for our burgers was getting us excited because we were starving!! The burgers arrive as well as the sweet potato fries. All of it was cold, and the place was nearly empty! It was a shame, I wanted to enjoy these burgers so bad. But I was let down. All I could think of is when Gordon himself sits down at these restaurants and spits food out haha I wanted to do this no lie. My girlfriend and I were starving so we ate the bloody cold food anyways. I would give this place one more shot just to give Ramsay a second chance. But that's only because I'm such a fan. Maybe next time Mr. Ramsay. Until next time."}
{"text":"Quality has gone downhill. This use to be a place I hit up almost everytime I was in town because it always had good service and great food. This last trip was the food was so disappointing. Started off with the Jalopeno poppers which are normally great, but some were luke warm and some were cold. Not a great start to the meal. I got the farm burger which I've had a few times before and love. Grin on my face ready to sink into this delicious burger to disappointment. It was bland! duck bacon, and egg, and good beef, yet bland wtf? I couldn't taste any seasoning on the meat and it tasted closer to a fast food burger than a gourmet burger. We opted for normal fries this time, which I havent tried since we usually do the parmasean ones and maui onion rings. The fries were luke warm too and came with 2 sides of curry tasting ketchup? didnt care for the ketchup at all, asked for ranch and the first server never came back with it when I asked. Had to ask a 2nd server after being nearly done with my burger at this point and the fries were cold by the time I got the ranch.The bill came and it was roughly $30 a person with tax and tip for a really meh experience. I really hope they get there stuff back in order. This was one of my favorite burgers in Vegas, but with so much competition it's just as easy to go somewhere else for a burger fix."}
{"text":"Not bad, but could be better. Burger is a little bit dry, more juicy would be nice."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas and I was planning on going to a different restaurant for dinner, but I LOVE Gordon Ramsay, so my friend and I decided to check it out. We only had to wait in a 15 minute line, and I loved that time. I got to check out Gordon's cookbook and grab a T-shirt while I was waiting. The vibe was GREAT and the food was EVEN BETTER! Best burger I have ever tasted in my life.  If you are looking for a great place to eat, go to BURGR! The service was awesome, the food was quick, and it was SO inexpensive especially for one of Ramsay's restaurants.  LOVED IT. I can't wait to go back to Vegas just so I can have another burger :)"}
{"text":"We went to try burgr after a disappointing experience at Ramsay's pub and a great experience at his steakhouse... We showed up at 1:30 and it was packed ! we waited and got a table I got a beer (Innis and Gunn), very good and we shared the euro burger. The fries and the burgers were great (they should go to the pub and show them how it's done !). The Waitress was nice and efficient. The only downside was the atmosphere a little too.... cafeteria in my opinion, which kills the experience a little bit since you are literally stacked on top of other people. Prices are reasonable and the food is good. A good place to grab a quick bite (if you can wait in line for a while...)."}
{"text":"I'm not giving this restaurant 3 stars for the quality of food because it was truly delicious! But the service was among the worst. I would highly recommend the jalapeño poppers. They were phenomenal despite the fact that temperature-wise they were not very hot. What really irritated my husband and I was we each had an ice water & I a diet coke. They refilled our water once after aggressively waving down a server that wasn't even our waiter! My husband ordered a beer that he did not receive until after our appetizer and as our burgers were being served. We also were nearly finished with our burgers when the fries came. After we were finished, we wanted to order a shake. We waited nearly 20 minutes to get our servers attention. After all was said and done, it was a $75 meal for two I would have rather spent at Bachi Burger."}
{"text":"First off, I would like to emphasize how GREAT the prices are for such high quality food ON THE STRIP. Food can get really expensive, but I feel at BurGR, you seriously get your money's worth and more.  I've been at this establishment twice, and it gets better each time. My first time, I had the Farm Burger because I love fried egg on my burger. It was delicious. The duck bacon was PERFECT and the flavors were dancing in my mouth. The burger was cooked perfectly, oh so juicy and tender. The second time, I shared half a Britannia Burger, and it was amaaaaazing. The mango chutney added the perfect amount of sweetness that cut the sharpness of the English cheddar. Once again, the flavors were dancing in my mouth and the burger was juicy and tender.   Some people would complain about how small the burgers are because they're so used to eating LARGE burgers, but I personally like the smaller size. I'd rather have a smaller burger with more intricate and thought-out flavors, than a large, greasy burger that leaves you with dissatisfaction and a heart attack.  I also got the Skinny Screw cocktail and it was light, refreshing, and tasty. To all my ladies and secure men who love fruity, refreshing drinks, this one's the winner.  And yes, everyone is raving about the truffle parmesan fries FOR A REASON. They are seriously frickin awesome and delicious. Get it before you regret it."}
{"text":"It is expected to have a long wait for a place like this. For 7 people, I was able to put us on the wait list and they texted us about 45 mins to an hour later to be seated. It's good but I am not sure if it's worth the wait and price.  Pros: The Chanterelle Burger - $16/$15 I enjoyed it. The medium was just right, pink but not bloody. A nice balance of mushroom and arugula. My favorite is the black and regular sesame on the buns. Delicious! It is a tad on the pricey side though.  The Truffle Parmesan Fries are excellent! They're thick fries (like steak fries). Crispy but potato-y and plenty of flavor. I love the aioli that came with it. The homemade ketchup was definitely tomato-y like tomato soup.  Cons: Long wait, Can be pricey, also my friend ordered a medium well burger and it came bout burnt and well done. They had to make her a new one.  Do Not Order the Honey-Pig Bao Buns! Gross. The meat was good but, it the steamed buns were bigger than the typical ones. So too much bun to meat. Also too much shredded carrots! This didn't take like a Gordon Ramsay item!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay has once again amazed me!  BurGR is hands down one of my favorite restaurants on the strip. When Hubby & I crave burgers, this place always come to mind. I love their modern, upbeat environment. The open dining floor is always super busy so don't be surprised if there is a little bit of a wait! I'm not too impatient here because the hostesses and waitresses are always so happy and eager to please. (Their sporty dresses are way too cute as well!)  The Hell's Kitchen Burger is always a go-to for me. The name alone really intrigued me the first time I came here. It's named after a popular TV show so it had to be a Ramsay staple! The burger is composed of a juicy patty with melted Asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, and an oven roasted tomato. The jalapeño really adds a nice kick to the tasteful burger.  The Chanterelle Burger is also a favorite of mine. It has Chanterelle mushrooms (of course), arugula, and figgy-onion jam. Pretty simple yet insanely flavorful. The jam sounds a bit skeptical, but it is amazing! There's a subtle sweetness to it which compliments the burger and its ingredients so well.  Do not pass on the Truffle Parmesan Fries either! They are everything you would ever want- and more. When you think the truffle stops at truffle oil, think again! These fries are covered in truffle Parmesan, truffle salt, and truffle aioli. They're definitely a triple truffle threat!  The burgers are all grilled over apple & alder wood and cooked to your preference. I always look forward to eating here. You can say that when it comes to burgers, I prefer mine without an \"E\". ;-)"}
{"text":"BurGR was good and I'd recommend this place if you want a burger to eat. I got the American burger and it was probably the best cheese burger I've feasted on in awhile. The down fall was the fries...they just weren't anything good (some over cooked and some undercooked). The dipping sauces were tasty so I ate them all anyways haha. Next time I'm going to get me a shake since they look delicious. All in all good burger joint and I'd visit again."}
{"text":"Saturday Night - 4 June 2016; Please read this review very seriously. I am a Physician from NY - I'm in town for a conference. My fiancé and I really wanted to come dine @ Gordon Ramsay's Restaurant; we had a number of concerns; Please read these - cause they aren't funny.  #French Fries are Not So Fresh; they tasted stale; I conferred with the neighboring table and they conferred this with us: the Fries Sucked; They suggested that the potatoes that were used to make these French fries were actually rotten. This is quite alarming. To be honest I also ordered the Onion Rings as well; After tasting the Stale/spoiled French Fries - I was able to cancel the Onion Rings; I had to track down the Manager - as he wasn't actively looking to talk to a \"Non Beautiful\" person like me - I sought the Manager out & explained these findings to him; He was understanding and removed the defective item from my bill. What frightens me, Why didn't everyone else complain? I care not to speculate.  #\"Beautiful People\" will get attention; I found myself waiting and waiting for drinks; I was the last guy to get drinks; water etc. etc. - Drinks overall were poor; Sodas had poor carbonation - They tasted flat. Drinking water tasted like Pool Water.  #Kelsey was our Waitress; I'm going to be brief & objective. Our table obviously wasn't \"beautiful\" enough for her to address. You - Kelsey - made it clear that you didn't enjoy taking care of us tonight; your body language and your tone gave it away. Although you did get our order correct, you didn't seem interested in checking back at our table - you weren't even that busy; But - I suppose we weren't \"Beautiful\" enough to bother with.  #I found you offensive, (Kelsey), when you told us to be patient - that our drinks would be coming; Disheartening - especially as I'm looking around and seeing everyone else with drinks.  #I felt the Manager to be evasive; I had to see him out. When I did - he was \"Stand Off Ish\" - but, he was willing to help me.  #Avoid the Curry Ketchup; Its awful. - Vegetables on the Burger were not fresh and cut properly.   Dear Gordon,  I hope you read this & take these findings seriously! - You need to come over and take a look @ what's going on.  Great Decor; Burger was just fair - But, everything else associate with the Burger is less than desirable and needs tremendously work.  We won't be back, not worth it.  Kind Regards."}
{"text":"Our waiter Gregg was excellent ! We didn't wait that long as we were lucky enough to get there before there was a 20-30 min wait . We sat as our waiter Gregg presented us the menu ! Told us what the favorite drink was which was innuis and dunis (that's if I'm spelling it right) very good drink if u ask me paid  $7 for it :) . Anyways got to the burgers as I asked him what his popular one was which was the farm burger . Now when I read what the farm burger had I was pretty a little at wheeze when it said duck breast ?? Just the duck word lol I don't eat duck !! Lol but he talked me into it as he said he said the same thing himself !! So because I like to take risks I told him to give me that burger as my husband took the Hell's Kitchen burger !! Let me tell you something we split the burgers in half I got half of his he got half of mine and those had to be the best burgers I have had so far so good my husband ordered another one to go !! Shocking as we dot eat burgers that much !! But it was DELECIOUS the tempature of the burgers were great !! The staff , management as management goes up to every table and makes sure everything is good and well with the food and service...The prices were reasonable and not that expensive !! I say it's better than payin for a expensive buffet when stuffing ur face and only getting two plates and ur full yea that's a waste !! Not here it's not pretty good if you ask me !! If there's anything I would complain about is mmmmm just the timely manner of when the food came just took longer than we thought but looked around and was packed everywhere so we kind of figured but the wait of our food coming didn't change the temp of the food as it came out just right :)  !! Thanks Gordon"}
{"text":"The food was great, it was what happened a bit afterwards that has caused some concern.  When I went to pay for the meal the waiter came back and said my card was declined, which is weird because I know I had money in my bank account (debit card) so I gave him my credit card and that seemed to go through fine.  Sometime later both of those cards were compromised...coincidence????  Not sure, it does seem a bit odd that they both had copies made from them and someone near Nevada was trying to do some serious charging.  Be careful with your cards people.  Thank goodness my institutions both saved me from what could have been a serious nightmare.  If I go back it will definitely be a cash basis situation."}
{"text":"Service was not so great. The burger was tasty but the hand cut fries were soggy... Not worth it. Had to wait 45 minutes for the food... Won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't really know what to say, except this is the best burger I've ever had in my life. The patty was juicy and well cooked, and the combination of tastes complemented everything perfectly. It really was as good as a burger can get. Just watch out though, the Hell's Kitchen's burger can get SPICY. The chanterelle mushroom burger, which my gf got, was also delicious. The parmesan truffle fries were tasty as well, and matched the burger well. The line can get long, but if you only have two people, they guarantee 20 minute or less wait if you stand in line. I waited about 4 minutes. Seriously consider making this place a staple of my vegas trips in the future."}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon around 2pm there was still an 1.5hr wait for a party of 8 pplz...we put our names down and headed to the tables hoping to win some lunch money...turned out to be a super expensive lunch if u counted the chips lost!!! it rarely works out in ur favor...  Once we were seated, the servers were really nice but the food took forever to come out... We ordered the truffle fries, the jalapeno poppers, a few burgers to share, a coconut strawberry shake ( the shakes are amazing...but its so sweet that you need another drink to quench the thirst afterwards, maybe w/ a beer??)   the burger bun looks delightful w/ the different colored seeds on top..but it turned out too dry..overall the food was pretty good...similar to 'plan check' or 'bachi' burgers but wasnt a hit out of the park type of good.  was it worth the wait?? NOOOO....great value for your food? NOOO...but i'd still come back again...if you have a bigger group just put ur name down and walk around miracle mile or gamble to kill some time...if your a party of 2, i think you have to wait in line but it goes by pretty quick."}
{"text":"This was a great dining experience. Although the wait was long (about 1.5 hours for a party of 7), the food and staff made up for it.  We got the fries, jalapeño poppers, and their creme brûlée milkshake on top of the burgers.  I got the Euro Burger but all of them looked amazing.   The staff was friendly and fun and made our experience enjoyable!"}
{"text":"BurGREAT.  Visiting Las Vegas from San Francisco, I quickly realized how spoiled I was at home, where there is an abundance of great, cheap restaurants. The first two restaurants we checked out on the strip were over-priced and their food and service left much to be desired.  Well, Gordon Ramsay BurGR changed everything. I had the Pork Belly buns as an appetizer (wonderful) followed by the Euro Burger with goat cheese. This was the best burger I'd eaten in a very long time. I was also very impressed that they actually listened to my request for the burger to be rare. Extra points for the service being top-notch.  This was the best meal we had in town and also the cheapest, go figure!"}
{"text":"I am so confused by the comments that I have overheard from other patrons. Some girls were dressed up in their finest club wear, talking about how the food was good, but then said they should have gone to McDonald's... Wow! That is all I have to say about the complaints about this place.  My experience was nothing but positive. My friend and I walked in without a reservation. The place was packed. The hostesses greeted us and told us it would be a ten minute wait. We barely got a chance to ask the bar for the drink menu before we got escorted to our table. On our way back the girl was engaging and sweet.  Chelsie was our server for the night and she gave a great spiel. It was quick and concise without feeling like she was rushing to get somewhere else. She came by our table on several occasions to check on us. It was not invasive and her bubbly personality was refreshing. Her busperson was on the ball. I wish I caught his name, but he was meticulous about clearing our dirty plates away and refilling our waters. They actually replace each water glass instead of just bringing carafes or pitchers around. I felt bad for him because my friend and I are water guzzlers. They worked as a perfect team.   Joanna, the manager, came by our table during our meal to check upon our satisfaction. We had nothing but positive things to say about our experience and she was definitely a part of that.  The food: The Jalapeno Poppers were gigantic. Of course in a game of Russian roulette I would draw the one with the seeds in it on my first piece. It was not too hot and the ranch mellows it out. The Pork Belly Hot Dawg reminded me of a Vietnamese sub. It had pickled diakon, carrots, cucumbers, and edamame on it with a drizzle of sriracha mayo. It was difficult to eat until we started to cut it up like an open faced sandwich. The \"dawg\" was on the salty side, but every other aspect was enjoyable. The Chanterelle Burger was moist, tender, and melt in your mouth. The mushrooms had a nice texture. The onion jam was a nice take on the classic combination of onions and mushroom. It gave an overall sweetness to balance all of the savory components. As a side, the two of us share the Truffled Fries. The potatoes are cut into pieces that look like wood slabs. Enough surface space to catch the truffle oil. The parmesan cheese could have been spread out and melted a little. It just sat on the top in a clump like cotton candy.  The drinks: The specialty cocktails did not look too appealing to us. They were geared towards the club crowd. Instead the 30 beers on tap are the way to go. If GR Pub aims for international selections than BurGR has premium domestics down. I was impressed with all the beers they had on tap. Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorite breweries. $7 for pint is not bad at all for the Strip. The only complaint about the night would be the delay in drinks. We were finished with our appetizers before our beer came."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! This place is seriously amazing!!! Great food and service for a place that is packed. We didn't get to try the desert, but it looks delicious!! Totally recommend this place and the Hells kitchen Burger!"}
{"text":"mama and split the american burger and sweet potato fries. both very delicious and cooked well. the restaurant is very chic and modern. scantilly clad waiteresses run around taking your order. lots of families in here during the day. menu prices aren't too bad. check comes with an iPad. good times with excellent service and good food."}
{"text":"Burgr is located at Planet Hollywood. I'm a big Hells Kitchen fan so I HAD to eat here. My husband and I went here on a Wednesday afternoon. It wasn't too busy so we got seated right away. It's a relatively small restaurant.   The waitresses went over the drink menu and gave us a few recommendations. I didn't care for drinks because I was super hungry. We ended up getting the truffle fries and jalapeño bacon poppers. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger. The jalapeño poppers are bomb!  They're pretty big and it's the perfect balance of cheese, jalapeños and bacon. It comes in 6 and 6 was kinda a lot for 2 people.  The truffle fries are steak cut and delicious. I got kinda full from the appetizers and didn't even touch my burger at the restaurant.  I ate my burger back at the hotel and it was so yummy.  It wasn't too spicy. It was still good even a couple hours later, so I'm sure it's super good fresh.   I'd recommend this place if you're gonna be in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Four and a half stars, let's say, for the food- which was fantastic. Extra half star to bring it up to five for being the best service we got on the Strip during our long weekend.  I ordered the farmhouse burger cooked rare, and it was perfect. I loved having the thick steak fries instead of the usual shoestring you get at other burger joints- we got the parmesan truffle.    A fantastic late-night dining experience overall."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that I am not here to rip a gordon ramsay restaurant because he is so critical of people on TV like i think many people are.   On a recent trip to LV i stopped by burgr. I enjoyed the ambiance and the way that the menu was presented. I ordered the farm burger which came with duck bacon and an egg along with the sweet potato fries. The burger was not overly flavorful but for what it was it was pretty good. The fries on the other hand came dusted with vanilla powdered sugar and had a jalepeno honey aioli on the side. They were WAY too sweet with absolutely no balance of flavor to the point where I found them inedible."}
{"text":"I wish I remembered our waitresses name, she was great, super cute, and took care of us. All the other staff we encountered was friendly as well. Yes the burgers are a bit high priced but your at a Gordon Ramsay joint on the Las Vegas Strip. Love the buns; soft yet hold up to the burgers juices and toppings. Both of our burgers were ordered medium but they were both cooked over this. We were too hungry to wait for another, they were still good. Tastes like a burger, the way it's suppose to. We shared some of their onion rings, love the Cheddar Ranch dipping sauce. I used some of their Chipotle Ketchup on my burger (I got the American) and it was a home run. My husband got the Hell Burger. Even though I love their Sticky Toffee Pudding push pops we decided to try a milkshake this time around. It was good, but had too much pudding on it. It was almost half of the shake, and was so thick and sweet. We will stick with the push pops next time. Sign up for the casino Total Reward card and you'll get a few bucks off your meal. I'm sure we'll return, we really want to try a hot dog!"}
{"text":"Gregg with 3 G's was our waiter he is a great waiter. We all had great burgers. Farm burger and euro burger onion rings and sweet potato fries. Omg so delicious. Wish we had room for a milk shake."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I'm not a beef eater, so I often search for places with a chicken or turkey burger. I have NEVER had a chicken burger on this level & the onion rings will be the best you've ever tasted. Definitely recommend Burgr!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made a stop here on our Vegas trip. We were very satisfied with our choice. Our disappointment with Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse included very rude staff and mediocre food (seems to be a consistent criticism amongst the yelpers). However, Gordon Ramsay's Burgr is a whole different restaurant compared to his steakhouse. The service was excellent! Very prompt, professional, and happy! The overall vibe of the restaurant is more laid back and casual with a trendy element in the decor. And this time, the food was great and far more plentiful. We ordered the euro burger, Hell's Kitchen burger, and a Oreo creme brûlée shake. The euro burger was so flavorful! The flavor of the first few bites was so delicious, however, it was quite overwhelming and filling towards the end of the burger. I would've preferred it in a slider size. The Hell's Kitchen burger, although not as flavorful as the euro, was excellent! It was not quite as heavy on the stomach as the euro, which made eating the full sized burger much easier. My personal preference would be to have more heat/spiciness from the jalapeños on the HK burger. And the Oreo creme brûlée shake was certainly unique and tasty, but nothing special in the way of taste (they have nice straws though!). My overall experience here was great and I would definitely return to try some of their other items.   Oh and also I was happy because I got to see Christina Wilson in the kitchen! She was the winner of season 10 Hell's Kitchen! I was cheering for her during that season. Happy to see her in Burgr's kitchen!"}
{"text":"Too much Hipe for the taste.  The Hipe of the burgers, It's Ok $17 for a burger, you get the same burger at one of the area's 100's of sports bars for $8 and not fight the crowds and the parking lots.   WE like Gordon Ramsay, just his burger is ok, nothing to write home to mom about!"}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay is one of my fave chefs to watch on TV. He's sort of the Simon Cowell of the foodie world and I love that!  I was extremely excited to dine here with the bf and our bodybuilder friend Seth (Elf boy). We actually patiently waited in line for about 20-25 minutes. Not so bad of a wait for a popular restaurant on a night where people were ready to grub before hittin' up da clubs.   I loved how casual the environment was but it still had it's little upscale feel to it with the service. I thought it was pretty cool when the waitress brought out this iPad drink menu where you can scroll through all the drinks they offered. Seth and I both had a glass of the Pumpkin beer which was bombtastic!   I honestly don't remember which burger I ordered but I do remember thoroughly enjoying it. The meat was cooked perfectly medium for my taste.   We also ordered 2 orders of sweet potato fries, 1 regular fries and onion rings for the table. I liked how the sweet potato fries came out with this delicious honey dipping sauce and there was powdered sugar all over them. You definitely don't need to order any dessert if you get these fries.  I definitely would come back here with a huge empty stomach so I can try out some other tasty items on their menu! Maybe for lunch that way there's no wait. :)"}
{"text":"Nothing special about the service, but I'm sure this varies depending on individual. The wait is long, but worth it for a taste of the Hell's Kitchen Burger (which I shared with my bf). We had already eaten dinner but we were looking for a nice late meal. Eating only half of the burger was still very satisfying and absolutely delicious. It is up there with the best gourmet burgers I have ever had the pleasure to taste. We also ordered fries (which is a tourist trap), they were $8 for a fair portion and bbq taste inspired sauces, but definitely not worth the $8 when the burger is satisfying in itself. Will be visiting again to taste more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Always delicious! Love the truffle fries and the skinny screw is refreshing and tasty. The service here is always top notch."}
{"text":"Good not great, not worth a hour wait. Pork belly appetizer was phenomenal. It gets expensive quickly, $15 for an a la carte burger is aggressive."}
{"text":"Decent prices, drinks were good, burgers were great.  Only complaint would be the thinness of the sweet potato fries. The regular fries are thick like steak fries, so these are crunchy and kinda tasted overcooked. Service was freat and quick, male waiter Jamie was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Came across this place while looking for a spot to watch the niner vs seahawks game.  Wasn't really interested in the food, just wanted to sit and watch the game over a few drinks... but we waited so long in line i started to get hungry.  I ordered the Farm Burger and my gf ordered the Hells Kitchen burger.  BEST BURGER IVE EVER HAD!  She said hers was the best too.  Pricey burgers ($15-$16) but WOW was it good!  A little background on my palate regarding burgers... I don't like fast food burgers except for Carl's Jr's $6 burgers, but even those sometimes come off as blah every now and then.  In n Out is do-able, but I can only handle that about twice a year, then I'm done.  The kind of burgers I like are burgers grilled on the que at home with the fresh toppings.  To me, nothing beats a homemade burger, but I have to say, this place overtook that spot.  It may be because it's different, but I would definitely recommend this place! :)  and i can't wait to go to vegas again so i can eat it again!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmmmmm. We decided to come here on a recent trip to Vegas after reading the reviews. We waited about five minutes and decided to sit at the bar. Tons of beers and cocktails to choose from, bartenders weren't too helpful at first but I think they were busy. After a beer they warmed up and chatted with us and suggested the Euro burger. I wanted to also try the Farm burger because I love the fried egg addition to burgers. We ordered the Euro, Farm, and truffle fries. Yes, yes, YES! The euro was the best burger I've ever had! Farm was decent but nothing compared to the Euro. Goat cheese on a burger, I will always say yes. The truffle fries and truffle aioli was delicious as well. I want to go back!"}
{"text":"Thought I would be great because of the it was Gordon Ramsey's place, long line and price but I was WRONG. Waitress was great but the food was OKAY. Thought it would be great because of the long line but that wasn't true. I order the jalapeño poppers (which was pretty good with a little kick), truffle fries (was alright it would have been better if they were skinny fries), and Hell's Kitchen burger (was okay, I had better though)."}
{"text":"I'm so sad that I have to give one star to this restaurant because the burger was really tasty and I would love to come back. It was four of us had the burger and three of us including myself ordered medium and one ordered medium well. Later on that night, I could not leave the bathroom for an hour. I think the burger meat caused all of us the huge stomachache. I was sick all night throwing up...  So I recommend you ordering them with medium well at least."}
{"text":"Euro burger - 4 stars . Cooked to perfection , goat cheese added an element that complimented the burger  Farm burger - good amount of bacon and the egg was runny giving the burger extra juiciness .  Fries -  \"just fries \" chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup were good . But a little overpowering . Fries could of been more crispy  Sticky toffee pops - amazing !! Probably best part of our meal   Cons - not enough of a selection of overseas beers . Too many domestic beer. More European style beers would of made my review 5 stars .  But The boddingtons on draft was delicious .  Overall total for meal -65 dollars"}
{"text":"I fell in love with the truffle burger until I cheated on it with the Hog burger.  Omg.  Foodgasm central.  But what else could you expect from a Ramsey place?!?!"}
{"text":"Nothing special bout this burger. The ambiance is nice and the place is usually crowded which usually is a telling sign that the place is good. Business brings business n I thought this would be a great burger! First off, we ordered the Hells burger, jalapeño poppers and truffle fries. Everything was really bland. We had to ask for some sauce to eat with the burger. I ordered medium and my burger came out medium rare. I would say the best thing bout this place is probably the service. Our waitress was really nice and attentive. 1 star for her and 1 star for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I wish you could give half stars, I would say a 3.5.  I'll start off with the line, it was not that long but it took along time for it to move almost 15 minutes for me to get seated but that's because I was a party of one and got to sit at the bar or else I would have been there way longer. I didn't expect it to take long since I was seated at 11:45PM on a Saturday.  It was quick to order and get my drink, since of course I was sitting right at the bar, but it was really long before I got my burger. I sat there for almost 45 minutes because I had to meet someone at 12:30PM and I got it right at that time. Luckily they were running late too so I had time to enjoy my food in the restaurant. During the wait though, the staff at the bar kept telling me that it will be out any minute and kept saying sorry for the wait which I find nice because they are at least acknowledging that it is taking a fairly long time.  I thought the food was great, I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it had a great kick because I like spicy foods. It really did satisfy my late night hunger and I was super happy with what I picked and maybe worth the wait but I still felt it was a super long time to get.   I would say overall what brought up this place to so many stars was the food, I felt the service was okay at best but not good by any means."}
{"text":"Amazing! I don't know what excited me more, eating at a Gordon Ramsay Restaurant or the dinner itself! Totally a great, relaxing evening! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Start with the food. The gooey fries so good. Definitely no diet food. I had a Britannia Burger, my husband and daughter had an American burger, and our son had a  Hell's kitchen burger. All but one burger was cooked perfectly medium and everyone enjoyed their burger. I ordered my burger lettuce wrapped I would not say it was the best lettuce wrapped burger I've had. There was absolutely no way I could pick it up and eat it I had to eat it with a fork and a knife.  Our drinks were refilled without request. The shift manager actually stopped at our booth and asked us how everything was .   The booth was uncomfortable because the tables were much taller than the booth seating. I am tall and my daughter is shorter and both of us felt uncomfortable... I felt I needed a booster seat. And my final comment would be as a server of  nearly 20 years I always felt uncomfortable in a job where I had to wear a skirt or dress that was a short as the servers are at Ramsey's. Most of the servers looked good in the short dress but many of them were  pulling them down and squatting awkwardly when they bend over a table or a booth... this is not Hooters where the attraction is what's hanging out and not the food."}
{"text":"Loved it!! The food was delicios.  Our sever Greg and Julia was the best!!   We order the American cheeseburger and truffle parmesan fries(different, yet delicious)"}
{"text":"If there's such a thing as a high end burger this is the place to find it. Our server said the patties are made on site and a mix of several different types of meat, plus add the seasoning, and what you end up with is a really good burger. Well worth the $15 when you include the location."}
{"text":"The wait was less than they quoted. Innovative text when table is ready. Our server was perky and a pleasure to deal with. Christine was working the pass and while the good took a bit to get out it was worth it. Only downer was the obvious stack of fries orders under a heat lamp and ours seemed not as fresh as the burger.  Had the all American and was cooked to perfection. Tasted delicious and was very juicy.  Son said his was the best cheeseburger ever and that is a strong endorsement.  Christine signed a menu for us for our 25th anniversary.  Great experience."}
{"text":"After a late brunch, we had an even later lunch here and just split a burger and some sweet potato fries. Man the burger was AMAZING. Seriously one of the best I've ever had. It's like God came down in the form of beef, cheese and bread and said \"this is my body, eat and you'll be a believer.\"   We got the Hell's Kitchen Burger. The bun was so soft and buttery. It was pretty spicy with a big slab of jalapeno on there, which I loved. We asked for it medium and there was no pink, but it still was extremely moist juicy beef.   And the sweet potato fries were definitively the sweet kind, with powdered sugar, and a side of lemon aioli, that was probably the best sauce I've ever had with sweet potato fries.   Really good interesting beer selection and I loved how they gave solid descriptions of each beer. I think they had some on tap at the bar that weren't on the tablet drink menu.   I'd love to come back!"}
{"text":"I love burgers so I was in Vegas so I figured I would give this a try and everything was perfect the burger was amazing!!! And there fries are perfect will be back soon"}
{"text":"Gil had Britania burger. And I had the Chanterelle. We split the truffle fries and could not finish them. We both loved the burgers. They were cooked perfectly and the rolls were so light!"}
{"text":"If there was an option for 0 I might be swayed to have rated it that way.  Though it seemed like a happening place the burgers were a huge disappointment.  Wait was 45 min the hey text me saying table was ready then we waited an additional 12 min for it to be setup?  Odd!  As you can imagine we were excited to try this joint out but the order took like 35 minutes to receive the food.  We ordered 5 burgers,1 fry & 1 onion ring.  All of our burgers were salty and we concluded it was the party that had so much salt.  It felt like we had been eating sunflower seeds all day.  Highly disappointing.  We did let the server know and she didn't seem genuinely interested so she was happy to take our money though.  Would not return based on last experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here twice for dessert while we were in Vegas for my conference.  On a previous trip, we came here for lunch, but it was dessert only during this trip.  I guess we were creatures of habit, as we got the same thing for dessert both times we came, mainly because it was flat out fantastic.  I posted a picture of our dessert for anyone that wants to see.  We each got a shake.  They're truly unique shakes in that they're part pudding and part ice cream shake.  I ordered the crème brulee pudding and cookies and cream shake, while my wife got the chocolate pudding and coffee ice cream shake.    They're pretty large shakes, so you'll definitely be full afterwards.  The shakes are $8 a piece, so they're not cheap, but totally worth it.  If you come here, be sure to save room for dessert.  One other thing to note, the seating at and around the bar is first come first serve.  So, you don't have to wait in the long line to get a seat.  We avoided what looked like a long line by doing this both times.  You can even order from the full menu in this area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for our last meal in Vegas because, well, it's Gordon Ramsay.  Unfortunately, BurGR was disappointing.  2 stars for the \"meh\" feeling.  - The HK burger was just okay.  The meat was juicy and had a smokey flavor, and the buns were fluffy with all their carby deliciousness.  However, the toppings didn't seem to add to the burger.  Where's the cheesy goodness?  Where's the kick from the jalapenos?  Avocado flavor anyone? - The Chanterelle burger got a 6/10 in the boyfriend's book.  In his opinion, \"The patty was overcooked when I asked for med rare and it wasn't juicy.  The bun was perfect and the sesame seeds complemented it well.  The mushrooms added a good flavor to the burger but was not enough to make up for the overcooked patty and the burger's overall lack of flavor.\" - Truffle fries were good but not worth the $11.  The seasonings were tasty but I don't know how the truffle part enhances the fries.  The house ketchup served with the fries wasn't up to par with even regular Heinz ketchup; it was weak.  GR needs to pay a visit to his restaurants if he wants to have returning customers."}
{"text":"Ok so, the wait for two wasn't bad last night considering it was Saturday and mayweather was fighting. Took about 45min to get a table. Waitress was friendly but forgot about us. Didn't come to refill our water until we were ready to leave. Prixe is high but expected in Vegas. Food was logos portions but not really overly impressed. Burger was not dry which was a plus, I chose the American burger. Fries were large cut but nothing special with regards to seasoning or flavor. Overall I'd probably not come back."}
{"text":"I was surprised that there were no grass fed beef options on the menu. The fries (both regular and truffle Parmesan) were good and our server was super friendly and knowledgable about gluten sensitivities."}
{"text":"Farm burger, euro burger  and the trufle parmesan fries were so good. Service is the best. Alex, our server, made sure everything was alright. Scott, their manager, made sure we were getting the best service. My wife is not a fan of burgers but this is one of the burger places that I can enjoy a burger with her. Thanks."}
{"text":"Fun environment, great burger combinations that make for a palatable meal. The ketchups for the fries were delicious. One was a little spicy, the other more robust with a curry flavor. Location on the strip was pretty good and within walking distance from most places/hotels on the strip."}
{"text":"Got the Euro burger (truffle oil, goat cheese, arugula) on a medium rare burger. Cooked perfectly!!!! Prob one of the better places to eat on the strip! I also added avocado for 3 bucks because why not. It's Vegas!! This place is located in planet hollywood and there's always a huge line but you can put your name down and they will text you when your table is ready.   Truffle fries are amazing- Share this with the table! We got 3 orders for 5 people...dying. My friends also got the jalepeno poppers to share---- too spicy and I like spicy food. Dipping sauce is excellent though."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect!  The staff very friendly and efficient  without making you feel rushed.  The food was outstanding.  The onion rings melt in your  mouth. Appetizer, cocktail and entree  per person came to $40.  Pricey for a burger joint but not for a restaurant on the strip.  I have no complaints.   Well worth it!"}
{"text":"The burgers were delicious! We ordered tandoori chicken buger and portobello mushroom burger. Chicken was flavorful and well cooked. However, the veggie burger started falling apart after a few bites. Truffle parmesan fries were good and jalapeno-rita cocktail was exquisite. We liked crème brulee chocolate shake too. Delicious food! 9/10"}
{"text":"I try to get to this place at least once every time I am in Vegas. Great burgers. Good beers on tap (Stone!). I've sat at the bar, I've sat at the stools just outside the bar, and I've sat at the \"kitchen bar\" where you can see into the kitchen. Every single time I've been there the waitstaff has been tremendous. Very personable and energetic. While sitting at the \"kitchen bar\" we even had a good humored conversation with the line manager and the restaurant manager. Everyone from the bartenders to the waitstaff to the check-in girls seems to enjoy working there and it makes the whole experience better. Sure the wait out front can be a little long, but it never seems to be intolerable. Plus, you can seemingly sneak in a spot at the bar if you are clever.  I recommend checking this place out. Definitely one of my personal Top 5 casual eateries in Vegas."}
{"text":"Burgr, simple right? But Gordon Ramsey takes it to a new level!   Simple burgers with great ingredients and cooked to perfection!  Had a big party in a rush and Megan took care of us! We told her ahead of time for split checks, so please tell your waiter/waitress right away- it a process you have to be patient with! Megan got our meals going on a busy night and she was awesome!   I'm not sure what everyone else in the party ordered but a few friends got the new  Gordon Burgr, not on the menu yet but friends devoured it!   The Jalapeño poppers are a must! And the dipping sauce was amazing! Best popper I've ever had, not too bready, it was just perfect! Unique presentation, great for sharing since each popper had its own glass with sauce in it.   I was excited for the Parmesan Truffle fries,  they were tasty but I'm not a \"steak cut\" fry  person, I prefer the shoe string cut and crispier fry! Dipping sauces were on point!  Now for my farm Burgr, lets just list a few adjectives: delicious, moist, fresh, amazing, simple, yummy! It's definitely a burger if come back for!   So price wise, it is more on the expensive side for a burger but from what my friends all ate, they said it was worth it! So do i, i consider it a treat burger! There are two pricings listed, black and orange [like a dollar off]. Orange is for total rewards, so while you're waiting in line head over to the Total Rewards counter by PF changs to get a free card, must be 21&older. I say it was worth it cause we had added gratuity due to our large party. And if you get 3 items on your check, that's $3! It adds up."}
{"text":"Three of us decided to dine at BurGR since we're all fans of Gordon Ramsay and were in the mood for some good burgers. Staff was friendly and courteous.  They seemed a little occupied with flirting with one another. We notice a few of them checking their personal mobile phones multiple times within the 1.5hrs we were there.  The cocktail drinks were very flavorful and fun.  For our meal we had:1) the truffle fries, which were perfectly done and accompanied with 2 house dipping sauces...yumm, 2) Hells Kitchens burger which was very tasty, 3) American Burger which was also perfectly done and flavorful and 4) the Damnation Chicken burger.  The chicken burger was very disappointing. The description on the menu failed to state that the chicken meat was ground meal vs a solid chicken breast. This was a major challenge for me and very unpleasant as I am NOT a fan of ground meats. I am very specific about texture and quality of the protein i consume, nevertheless, I ate the burger. It was very well seasoned and cooked however it was very difficult getting passed the ground meat texture in my mouth :(    I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and felt a little uncomfortable returning my order especially since the other 2 individuals loved their orders. That really ruined the dinner experience for me and it changed my impression of GR, a 'perfectionist'. Just wish the menu had specified the ground meat element of the chicken."}
{"text":"It's basically an overpriced burger joint owned by Gordon Ramsey   I had the Hells Kitchen burger with the Parmesan fries.  The burger was good and flavorful but not worth the price in my opinion  the fries were tasty"}
{"text":"The best vegaterian Burger we have ever ate.    The portion size was perfect,  presentation was simple and clean.   Fries are all cart with three different options,  we had the sweet potato they were awesome,  one order is easily enough for 2 ppl.    Our service was awesome with our waitress Mia being a seasoned veteran being here since the grand opening and our drinks were never empty due to their great bussers.    Delivery of our food was fast but not rushed.    Two burgers,  fries and one soda came to 46$ but it was amazing and we will be back.   Drink and desert menu is on a I pad which is neat and the bill comes with a service Survey on a ipod.   Rumor has it,  it's the number one restaurant on the whole strip doing over 40-50k in sales a day.    The secret to their other burgers is some sort of amazing butter mixture and the way they grill the meat.    Do not come here to save calories :)"}
{"text":"$56 total bill for 2 burgRs, truffle fries and an iced tea. Plus tip. Its good burgers but don't know if I'd come again it was more curiosity than anything. It was a bit over priced. I had Gordon Ramsey burger duck bacon, avocado, cheese. Truffle fries w house made ketchup tasted like marinara. The portion was good I cut the burger in half n couldn't finish it like 1/3 lb burger."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but HOW DOES GORDON APPROVE OF THIS???  I ordered the Euro burger and tried some of my friend's parmesan fries. The burger wasn't particularly amazing....but it wasn't horribly disappointing either. It was just a simple burger, nothing more of mediocre. I had my burger split with a friend and the presentation was downright insulting to GR's name. One of the halves was plopped sideways and the other one toppled down the other side of the plate. The fries were alright...pretty pricey but comes in a pretty large portion--probably good enough to split among 3 friends.  Even sharing a burger with a friend my individual bill still came out to be $12 for only half a burger. That's not okay. What else could I have gotten for $12? Like 6 in&out burgers or a chipotle burrito w/ guac....but to my disappointment I only got half a mediocre burger.  The service here was just atrocious. My friend had to ask for hot sauce 3 times. The 3rd time she had trouble catching any server's attention so she said \"excuse me\" a little louder. One server shouts back \"WHAT?\" Uh, what the !@$%? Since when is it ever okay to shout back at a customer....rude. It also took like 40 minutes for our food to come out, and not even the appetizers.   Other than the strange server situation, I feel like the whole Gordon Ramsay thing is a marketing ploy and they try way too hard to use his name on every little detail of the restaurant to brainwash you into thinking you're actually getting food from a michelin star chef...but I don't understand how Gordon Ramsay would ever actually approve of this disappointing dining experience himself. Shame on you, Gordon."}
{"text":"After an unpleasant experience with the food last time I came I decided to give this place another chance while I was in Vegas.  Instead of ordering a chicken burger this time I just order a regular American burger to try and my mom gets ballsy and orders the spicy Hell's Kitchen burger. We also started off with onion rings.  I absolutely loved my burger. It was delicious. It completely made up for the bad burger I had here when I came the first time. My mom however, although was warned, sent her burger back because it was too spicy. She reordered the same one as me instead because she saw how much I enjoyed it.  The weird thing was when they brought back the new burger it was cut in half. She asked why it was cut in half and they said they needed to ensure the temperature of the burger. I thought that was a pretty stupid answer since they're not doing that for all their burgers so clearly there's another method to check the \"temperature\". She was pretty upset they cut it because it made eating the sandwich harder since everything kept falling apart and it became super messy which ruined her experience.  Anyway, besides that downside, I had a good time and the waiter was nice and attentive."}
{"text":"The 30ft flame welcome is def what caught my eye first. After a 20min wait (weekday, noon), we were seated and ordered the Farm burger, chili dog, and truffle parmesan fries. Food took a good while to arrive, but service was friendly. Fave was the 12in long chili dog wrapped (just the center) in a nice fluffy bun. The sauce was delish and I loved the avocado on top. Farm burger was also very tasty. Fries were salty, but the 2 sauces were fantastic. Will def be back next time I come to LV!"}
{"text":"The wait time wasn't bad at all, waited about 15 minutes  for a party of 4 .  First of all ...  Love the place and love the menu  The Onion Rings are beyond perfect, their the Perfect bite and the Jalapeños poppers are amazing !!!  Now to the burgers  The Hell's Kitchen and Farm burger are divine !!!!  I had the Hot Dog with all the trimmings and OMJ I want another one NOW !  Overall Ramsey did a great job with the place is Absolutely delicious !"}
{"text":"It is difficult to find very good customer service in Las Vegas but when you walk into this burger restaurant you are treated like a \"fine diner\" despite the somewhat casual fare. This is an excellent foray into finer food and Alex \"with the glasses\" and manager Joana are happy to assist in making decisions in case you're not familiar with some of the ingredients on the menu.. (Turns out duck breast bacon on the Farm Burger tastes quite like regular bacon but better!) Hubby had the Farm Burger which was recommended by three staff members and it did not disappoint! I had the Hell's Kitchen burger subbed with a chicken patty but I couldn't even finish it because I found Heaven on a plate, aka truffle fries. (PS, I HATE mushrooms but would KILL for truffle fries.) The portions were perfect, especially if you want to fill up but were raised not to throw away good food. The jalapeno poppers were out of sight, presented individually  in swanky little cups with dipping sauce. There will be a long line BUT the great news is the staff is insanely well organized and we were seated in about 20 min. We learned that chef ramsay shows up regularly and actually works with the staff, including my waiter. There is absolutely no disconnect between the atmosphere you see on Chef's TV shows and they way the food is presented and the restaurant is run. This is for real. It is very clear that Chef insists on perfection and it trickles down even to the hostesses and other support staff. You can tell these employees are proud to be a part of this incredible spot. Unbelievable! In a town full of smoke, mirrors and BS, go to Burgr for a truly enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"The wait is worth it.   Burger was fantastic.  The staff were very polite and the service was great.   We will definitely go back. Holsteins not as good."}
{"text":"Euro Burger!!! Oh my, how i miss thee already. At first i thought I wouldn't like this place. I really just wanted to check it out because It's a Ramsey restaurant.  The price was reasonable which was a pleasant surprise. The wait was not bad either because It's one of those eat and get out quick type of setup. Staff were awesome and seemed like they genuinely care about the customers.   So I tried the Euro Burger and Truffle fries. I had to literally eat slow because I wanted to savor the moment! Fries were nice and crunchy outside, moist and tasty inside. The truffle sauce... Oh man, the truffle sauce! Can't get enough of that thing. It was sooo good that having only one cup was not enough.   Now here comes the Euro Burger. Meat so juicy, sauce oh so darn good. Even the bun tasted amazing. Hands down one of the all time top 5 burgers that I tasted so far. I can probably eat 5 of them at once if my stomach was big enough.   Sure the place looks like a tourist trap but don't let that stop you from visiting this place. The next time i visit Vegas, I will definitely get me some Euro Burger again."}
{"text":"Good service at the bar - came here for work. Nice beer selection and excellent hummus.  However, when your name is Burgr they shouldn't taste bland and be uninteresting taste-wise. I didn't finish mine which is saying something.  Too bad... I walked right past Cosmo d my usual Brger go-to, Holsteins, to try something new.   Would try it again but too many options here in town. Boo...."}
{"text":"Cool pub, fabulous server, and even got to see Mr. GR himself. Pretty cool to find the boss man at his own restaurant.  Not sure why it took us so long to find this place. But just FYI, this place is at the north front entrance of Planet Hollywood. There you will see a long line of people. Don't queue up in the line unless you are a party of two. Go up to the hostess and tell her how many there are in your party. Once you've checked in, they will give you a text to let you know when your table will be ready. It's Vegas, go get a drink or something. That's exactly what we did.  Upon seating, we were greeted by our flamboyant server. This guy is full of jokes. We were a light hearted crowd, so everyone enjoyed his personality. He was also quite helpful with the beer/drink selection. I remember ordering a good IPA that had hints of apricots. Gotta have a good beer to take advantage of a good burger.  Appetizers: Got the jalapeno poppers and a few others(in my party) got the fries. Both apps were tastefully plated. If you've ever had a jalapeno popper from Jack in the Box, you know how it should taste like. BurGR definitely delivered the essence of the fast food favorite in a glamorous way. Crispy outer shell with molten lava cheese stuffed inside. The fries were accompanied by some fancy mayo and ketchup. Both dipping sauces were unique and very complimentary to the french fries.    Burgers: Had opted for the Farm Burger $15 Duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, fried egg -Although it sounded good on paper. The duck breast bacon made the entire burger a bit too salty towards the end. I had asked for the egg to be runny, but it was pretty much cooked all the way through. All in all, not a very well rounded burger. I think if they added some avocados or guoc to the mix, this burger would take off.  One of my friend got the The Hog Burger $18 Mangalitsa pork, English sharp cheddar, apple butter, arugula -Luckily, I got to sink my teeth into another burger at this restaurant. Although it was a pork burger, the seasoning was well balanced. The pork almost tasted like beef. Didn't taste the apple butter, but the cheddar and arugula was the perfect combo to the mangalitsa pork. Best pork burger I've ever had(Can't say I've had many).  My overall experience was quite good. Not gonna lie, seeing Gordon Ramsay was definitely the cherry on top. To put it in few words, BurGR is a somewhat upscale gourmet burger joint. You can call it a fancy pub."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, and no problem adding an egg to any. Two of our crew had the portobello burger with avocado and no cheese so as a vegan burger it was amazing. But for the carnivores the ground beef patties on the burgers were juicy and cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Hello there fellow Yelpers!  First I want to emphasize the fact that I am a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay. That man is a genius! One of thee best food engineers ever. So therefore I ordered quite a handful.  Honey-Pig Bao Buns. This dish consists of roasted pork belly, cucumbers radish, cilantro, and honey-hoisin sauce. My god those combinations of flavors goes well. The Bao Bun was soft and strong in flavor. The pork belly was cooked just right. And with the mix of the selected greens, it gives the dish a fresh and healthy taste. The hoison sauce didn't over power the dish, which was perfect. Everything was complimented perfectly.  Truffle Parmesan Fries. The sides of the meal, but man do they pull their weight in this meal filled with amazing flavors. I received the fries with two sauces, truffle aioli and chipotle ketchup. The truffle aioli amazingly compliments the saltiness of the fries. The chipotle ketchup is something I asked for on the side, and it has a strong kick to it. Definitely worth it.   Farm Burger. My burger consisted of duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. I asked for my burger medium rare, and man was it fantastic. The flavors of the duck breast bacon and fried egg meshed nicely with their great burger patty. This place has really lived up to Gordon Ramsay's name.   Shake #4 aka Oreo Shake. My god, creme brulee pudding with an oreo shake and an oreo cookie to top it off! This was a great blend. Hands down, best creme brulee I have ever tasted, and it mixed well with the oreo shake. I recommend having both in one spoon full. It's not too sweet, but just the right amount of sugar. No one wants their desserts overpowered by just pure sugar.   Now to top it all off, the service here is amazing! The fact that this place is located in Vegas also makes it awesome! I hope to make future reviews on new dishes that I did not get to try out on my next visit to the BurGR! Signing off Yelpers.   -G Fizzle"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Vegas!  So good that after trying it for the first time I went back for more the very next day!  Good burgers, yummy truffle fries (huge portion more than enough for two), and the best shakes I've ever tasted!!  I LOVED the banana shake with butterscotch pudding.  I got to try the Oreo shake with creme brulee pudding and that was delicious as well.  I may have to get that next time!    Servers are pretty friendly.  I really liked our server on the first day: friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and cute too to boot.  I wish I had gotten his name but he looks like Clark Kent without the glasses :p  I think he knew he had us in the palm of his hand and that we would give him a good review so he had us fill out a survey after our meal.  Of course we rated him highly!  We unfortunately were not seated in his section the next time we came in but when he saw us he gave us a smile and a wave :)  FYI: they do not take reservations over the phone or online.  The restaurant fills up quickly within that first hour of opening so get there early or be prepared to wait a bit.  If cigarette smoke bothers you try to get a table in the middle or toward the front of the restaurant.  The back section is very close to the slot machines so it gets very smoky there - we requested to move from that section on our second visit.    One more thing to note: to enter the restaurant if you are coming from another hotel take the entrance just at the top of the moving walkway that takes you from the street to the hotel, which is next to Cabo Wabo Cantina (on the Paris side of the building).  An added treat: you get to take your menu home with you as a souvenir :)  Totally recommend this restaurant and I cannot wait to go back!  P.S. Make room for their shakes!!"}
{"text":"This location is located in the casino area of the PH Hotel, just inside the strip entrance doors.   The wait is usually about 1-1.5 hours, so be prepared for that.  The nice thing is they will take you cellular number and page you when your table is ready.  That means you can hit the mall and shop while you wait.!  The burgers are really really good.  My girlfriend loves the Brittania.  The onion rings are awesome and their special ketchup is top notch.  I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"this will be a simple review.  service: mediocre, not much to say about the waitress beside the fact that she was friendly and helpful about the menu.  atmosphere: a little above the typical burger/bar type of feel.  the food: i would not say the best burger i have ever had, but definitely up there. i liked that it wasn't greasy at all, i literally did not need a napkin while eating it. this means they are using top of the line beef, which i appreciate for the price i paid. if you get the chance to try this place, go for the onion rings! i keep day dreaming about how great they were! NOT greasy at all and the sauce they give you is great! yum!"}
{"text":"OMG! There is nothing else to say. First off I must say you really have to take this yelp thing with a grain of salt cause opinions are like a**holes. So here is mine I hope it helps. I really don't understand anybody that would give this place a bad review. For those that complained about long wait times I don't know what else you would expect at rush hour of an outstanding restaurant. We went today at 3:00 and we were seated right away. No wait at all. Our hostess was very friendly as well as our server Greg. The ambiance was fun and upbeat. We started with the onion rings and the Belgium beer. Both of them were out of this world. The rings came out in about 2 min. Then we ordered the Farm burger and the Euro burger both cooked medium. I highly recommend medium for a little pink. They were both phenomenon! Dare I say the best burgers we have ever eaten. The Duck bacon was intriguing and delicious but I honestly couldn't tell any real difference. We also had the truffle fries. They were dynamite as well. We topped it all off with the Oreo shake topped with creme' brule pudding. It was fantastic as well. The total bill was $78 not including the gratuity. We left stuffed! Some people mentioned that the burgers are on the small side. I disagree, they are average at 7 oz and I did not leave feeling hungry. Honestly this place is worth every penny. If you don't want to wait go early. If you do have to wait I can assure you it is simply due to the large volume of patrons. I watched the guys in the kitchen and they were a**holes and elbows just cranking out the food. I can't rave about this place enough. This right here is reason enough alone to come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was one of my only highlights on my vacation. The burgers were delicious and the decor was fabulous. Very glad I went here."}
{"text":"Rumored to have the best burgers you've ever had. Not quite that good...but good. Everything is a la carte, making it an expensive place to be sure. Try one on the non-beef burgers, I think that's may have been better."}
{"text":"If you love burgers, then you MUST try Gordon Ramsay's Burgr restaurant! This place is currently in my top 5 burger restaurants.  Food: I ordered the Farm Burger. The fried egg was cooked over easy, so when you bite into the egg, they yolk will ooze out and create a nice spread throughout the burger. The quality of the meat was on another level, and the cheddar cheese that melted on the meat was the perfect complement.  Sides Notes  Ambiance: The décor was casual with TVs throughout. The eye opener was the wall of fire. Yes, real fire.  Service: The service was great, considering the restaurant was packed, and there was a 1.5 hour long wait. Be prepared to wait!  Overall: Although I waited 1.5 hours, I would still say that it was worth the wait. Put your name down on the list, and go gamble.  I highly, highly recommend Burgr!"}
{"text":"Be ready for a long wait when you're coming to eat at BurGR! I had to wait about 50 minutes  on a busy weekend but the good thing is that you don't have to wait in line to get seated! You can just walk around the miracle mile shops and wait for a text that says your table's ready!   It took about another 30 minutes to get our food but my table ordered the Britannia Burger, Fish and Crisp Sandwich, Sweet Potato Fries and Gooey Fries.   - Britannia Burger (cheddar cheese, mango chutney, arugula): I liked the burger! The mango chutney was a surprisingly good mix and as a whole it was quite tasty. The hamburger patty was cooked perfectly as well. I wouldn't say it's the best burger I've had in my life though.   - Fish and Crisp Sandwich (ale battered cod, salt/vinegar crisps, tartar sauce on a large bread toast): This sandwich was so massive that my boyfriend's jaw hurt after eating it! The bread was way too thick and overpowered the fish. We wished that they hadn't made it into a sandwich! I don't think we'll be getting this again.  - Sweet Potato Fries with honey jalapeno mayo: One of my favorite things to eat here. It was a perfect blend of sweet, salty, and savory! I highly recommend this.  - Gooey Fries (hand cut fries, gouda cheese, salami, over easy egg): It was a sad, sad moment when we witnessed our waitress deliver this plate and decided to stab a fork into our egg for us last minute. The pleasure of breaking open our own egg was stolen from us ): It's pretty funny in retrospect because it was such an odd thing to witness. Anyways, the fries were a bit too cheesy for us but if you're into cheese then I think you would like this.   Overall, the food was tasty (aside from the fish sandwich) but it didn't live up to my expectations of a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. It was a good meal but not the best I've had. Considering the slow service and long wait time, I'd only come back if I had lots of free time on my hands!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much but was pleasantly surprised.  Great hella kit hen burgr.  Would go back, quick easy eats on the strip walk :)"}
{"text":"So I just realized a couple weeks ago I checked in and promised a review but never wrote one. Sorry gang blame the nice weather and free flowing alcohol here in Vegas for my forgetfulness. The restaurant was awesome. The Parmesan truffle frys were the bomb!! I could have eaten a ton of those suckers. The burger was top notch. Exactly what you would expect from Gordon Ramsey. This is a nice way to have Chef Ramsey's food without the ultra high price. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food was awesome. You must try the hell's fire burger and the euro burger. Both have exceptional taste, and are made with delicacy. Also try the truffle fries; they complete the meal.   I knocked off a star because the wait was long. It took about 40 minutes for the food to come out after we already ordered. Perhaps it was just a busy Friday night during Labor Day weekend."}
{"text":"Woohoo! This place is great. I am going to have to say it was the best burger I have ever had. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger cook medium with a hazelnut coffee/chocolate pudding shake and sweet potato fries. Very busy so expect to wait unless you have a diamond card then you won't have to wait as long. It took us 15 minutes to get seated, the waitress took our order right away and the service was great.  Loud sport bar type atmosphere, well worth the wait and we are definitely coming back. A must go to for Ramsay fans!"}
{"text":"A group of us decided to try out BurGR for lunch.  We got there at 12:30 PM and there was a line but it was moving at a good pace.  We noticed that there was a sign that said larger groups needed to check in with the hostess.  Our name was taken down for a table for 8 and we were told to come back at 1:30 PM.  When we returned our table still wasn't ready.  We ended up being seated closer to 2:00 PM.  The service was ok but the food was hit and miss.    Uber Cheese Burger* $15 - was good but I expected a better flavor from the patty since it was supposed to be grilled over apple & alder wood.  While it was cooked the way I wanted it tasted like the patty was cooked over a flat top not wood.  The burger was however very cheesey which is what I wanted.   Truffle Burger* $21 (couple of us ordered it) - not worth the price.   Couldn't taste the foie gras flavor and the frisee lettuce detracted from the burger.    Pork Belly \"Hot Pockets\" $12 - ordered for my 6 year old nephew.  They were tiny and not tasty.  We ended up getting him a happy meal after we left.  His mom tried it and said she didn't blame him for not wanting to eat it.    Fury Chicken Wings $14 - Tasty but small and not a lot of \"fury\" in the heat levels.    Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings $9 - really good, everyone at the table that tried it enjoyed them.    Chanterelle Burger* $16 and Farm Burger* $15 - didn't try these but was told they were good.  Truffle Parmesan Fries $11 - was overly salty and not worth ordering.     None of us are likely to come back again in a big group but if we do return we know what not to order now."}
{"text":"So excited to try this place after reading the reviews, ugh what a let down. Totally not worth it! Honestly, In n Out was better than the burger here. My bf got the Gordon Ramsay burger which is not on the menu and I got the Hell's Kitchen burger. The meat wasn't juicy and the burger in general was flavorless. We also got the Onion Rings which were probably the best part of the meal and the Jalapeño Poppers which were spicy AF!! I'm Mexican and can take heat and I couldn't take it. Idk if they were a bad batch or what but they were super spicy! The wait on a Sunday at 2pm was 40 mins for a table for two. $60 and 2hrs later, totally disappointed!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Yummy food!!! And a vegan can eat here too.  The staff is very responsive to special request to plant based healthy eating.  The cocktails are amazing and my husband love the beer list.  The service was awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try a jordan ramsey restaurant and the Fury wings are delish! Best part was the lovely manager hooking us up cuz we had to wait forever for them wings. Burgers were good their meat was soo moist and tender.  Oh man the parmesan truffle fries were good especially with the chipotle ketchup.... Ugh mouth wateringly good."}
{"text":"I've had the euro burger two times already and every time I eat it, I get the same explosive feeling inside my mouth. It makes me want to do the robot (my happy food dance) and scream out off the top of my lungs,  \"I love you Gordon Ramsay!!!!!!!!!!\"  It is seriously so good. Some people in my party weren't wowed by their burgers, one had the duck/bacon and the other had the American. Well idk about all that but that euro was so good I didn't mind their complaints at all. Everything sounded like music to my ears. And you probably shouldn't get American anyway. I mean it's cheese, lettuce, tomato, & onion.. How shocked do you expect your taste buds to be...   Hell's & Euro all the way!!!   Medium rare is perfect. The meat is sooo tasty and juicy, I wish Gordon was there, I'd hug him."}
{"text":"My burger was tasty, and the service was great, but I think this place was a bit over-hyped. The chantarelle burger was certainly good with a nice combination of mushrooms and some sort of a fig jam, but not one of the best burgers I've ever had. Truffle fries were cooked well, and certainly large enough to share. We arrived right as they opened for lunch so we were able to get a table immediately. Like many places in Vegas, they go a bit overboard on the technology, just because they can (ipads for cocktail menus, mobile device for payment, etc), which is ironic because it often makes the process more difficult. All in all, it's a solid restaurant with good service and a nice alternative to just about everything else in Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Another overpriced burgr spot on the strip.  But this one has a nice decor and they know how to cook your burgr just the way you ask. This one is worth it."}
{"text":"Can you ever go wrong with anything created by Gordon Ramsay?? The burgers were absolutely worth the hour wait. Cooked to perfection and the sweet potato fries were amazing. Can't wait to come back here again."}
{"text":"I ordered \"The Hog\" with some onion rings. The food was really good, but my burger was extremely greasy. The sweet pickles were definitely a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"alright alright, the hype is justified! start with the truffle fries - they are delicious! Then move on to one of their many burgers to choose from. The list is not overwhelmingly long, which I appreciate, and each burger is sufficiently different from the next - making it easy to choose! I tried a bite of the farm burger - Amazing. I attempted to eat an entire Hells kitchen burger, and only got half way through. That's not because the burger was huge, it's because I made the mistake of filling up on fries and bloody Marys... andddd I was saving room for a milkshake ;) Have you seen their milkshake options? yeah! save room for dessert. The Hells Kitchen burger was terrific, if you want a burger with some heat, that's the one you want! We tried three different milkshakes on our table - my favorite was probably the Oreo/Crème brûlée one, followed by the Chocolate/Caramel one. As much as I love coffee, i though the milkshake was only okay, and I didn't get to try the strawberry/coconut, but it sounded delish! Couple other things worth knowing - the wait is going to be long no matter when you go. They don't take reservations, so get there early, put your name on the list and then find entertainment in the mall or casino for the next hour or so. The seats are uncomfortable - that's probably intentional; so that you get in, eat, and get out as quickly as possible. If you're willing to deal with these two minor inconveniences for a memorable burger, Burgr is the place!"}
{"text":"GORDON RAMSAY TREBLE  Joe's Cable Car vs. Gordon Ramsay BurGR (Hawaii vs. Georgia in the Sugar Bowl)  Last month I went to Vegas and ate at two Gordon Ramsay's eatery: Pub & Grill (Caesars Palace) and Steak (Paris Las Vegas). I was never able eat at his burger joint. If I ever went back to Vegas this burger joint was one of my destination. Well that day came this Tuesday  In another matter last week I ate at a San Francisco burger intuition Joe's Cable Car that had been opened for over 40 years, but closed it's doors for good last Sunday. My eating experience at Joe's Cable Car was comical because the burger was a rip off. I'm a big fan of mom and pop eateries as long as they don't charge \"big boy\" prices. By charging those type of prices suggest their food is world class. If that's the case their food should be scrutinized. Is it unfair to compare a burger from a mom and pop versus a Michelin Star? From the outset yes, but if the prices are similar no. If I had to put a sport analogy it would be during the BCS college football era where mid major schools that were undefeated during the regular season would lobby to get into a BCS bowl game. Those teams who do get to play in a BCS bowl games better show up against their opponents otherwise they will get embarrassed and be ridiculed for their BCS birth. A great example is the 2008 Sugar Bowl where Hawaii, a mid major team, was blown out by Georgia.   However going to Joe's Cable Car provided me a great reference what to order at Gordon Ramsay BurGR. There are a lot of different varieties of burgers at Gordon Ramsay BurGR, but I wanted a burger that was similar in style to Joe's Cable Car for comparison. In fact I ordered 3 items as I did at Joe's Cable Car: a burger, fries, and soft drink. At Gordon Ramsay BurGR I ordered an American Burger, a side of fries that included chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup, and a Pepsi. The American Burger was the closest thing I can find that was similar to the burger I ordered at Joe's Cable Car - a straightforward burger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions topped with American cheese. But that's where the similarities end between those two burgers. Even though I requested both burgers to be cooked medium rare the American Burger was moist and juicy while the burger at Joe's Cable Car was dry and pasty. I enjoyed every bite of this American Burger. All I got is one question. Joe how can a Brit make an American classic better than you? The dipping sauces of chipolte ketchup and curry ketchup were tangy and delicious for the fries.   But here's the kicker. The price I paid at Joe's Cable Car was about $26. The price I paid at Gordon Ramsay BurGR was about $24. While the burger at Joe's Cable Car was served in a plastic plate, the American Burger at Gordon Ramsay BurGR was served on an actual plate.   Now you see why if a mom and pop place charges \"big boy\" prices they should be scrutinized? If you're to compare your eating establishment to Michelin Star's owned restaurant you better be Boise State than Hawaii. The burger eating experience at Joe's Cable Car and Gordon Ramsay BurGR was as if I was watching Hawaii vs Georgia in the Sugar Bowl - a total blowout where one team shouldn't have been on the same field."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I've been here twice and both times the food was delicious. My favorites are the Asian wings and Mac n' cheese burger. I like how they have a small, not overwhelming complex complicated menu- which I'm sure ensures consistency and simplicity. The only thing needing improvement on is the customer service side of the restaurant. Often times there is a long line along the wall of this restaurant in the lobby of the hotel which moves so sloooowwww. To my surprise both times we waited in line for a table to open up to walk in and see that the restaurant was half empty. Maybe this is done on purpose the same way nightclubs keep long lines outside to establish the overall appeal or desirability of the restaurant itself. Or maybe they figure that these patrons are one-time customers on vacation so making them wait won't affect their overall business model. I like this place and would go back but the line is less than desirable especially for a quick-service burger joint!"}
{"text":"We had the parmesan truffle fries the euro burger and the ahi sliders. Everything that we had was absolutely wonderful! Euro burger, I cannot say enough about! Definitely worth going to"}
{"text":"Admittedly, this place is a bit pricey for the food that you get. However, I am always satisfied with the quality of burger, the beautiful display of the food, and I can never get enough of the fries. The location (right inside Planet Hollywood) is spectacular. If you're willing to spend a few extra bucks for a great burger, then I'd definitely recommend BurGR.   If you like eggs (particularly ones with runny yolk), especially if you've never gotten an egg with your burger... You MUST get the farm burger, hands down. I've gotten this all 3 times I've been here, and it's never disappointed. The meat is juicy, tender, and flavorful. As for fries, I prefer the truffle fries -- the truffle sauce is simply spectacular. My mouth is watering even as I think about it. If you can, just slather as much sauce as you can and then ask for more. I've asked for seconds (and thirds) of the sauce before.  NOTE: If you're aiming to get in at a reasonable time, particularly on busy Vegas weekends, I would start waiting in line even before it opens... Otherwise, it's not quite worth the wait. Last time I was there, we arrived around 30 minutes after opening and had to wait about an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"Best burger in town, and for that price its a steal. Truffle and euro are one of my favorites. I make sure i come here every time i visit Vegas."}
{"text":"All I have to say is Gordon Ramsay knows what the hell he's doing because the food was superb. Not only were we able to get prime seating during busy season, but everything was served in a timely manner. Our waitress never forgot about us in her hustle and bustle around the restaurant. She even remembered to put in our dessert order before our meal was over. I really appreciated that. The burgers were appropriately priced and amazing. I suggest adding on the ooey gooey fries with the meal!"}
{"text":"We ate a late dinner at Burgr last night.  It tool about 20 minutes to get a table... Not bad. We ordered a shake, and dinner. It took about 15-20  minutes just to bring us our shake, I ordered a burger and my husband ordered a salad and shared fries.  It took another 20 or so minutes to bring our meals. My husband's salad looked like a pile of over cooked noodles.... Tasted nasty. My burger was fine.... Nothing to brag about. The fires were undercooked and over seasoned... No one was really even good about water refills. We did speak with the manager Benjamin, his only comment were we locals????? really.. This place sucks. I am so shocked, this was a place that I would have thought would have been amazing... Save your time and money there are to many other Burger places in Vegas"}
{"text":"We dined here during a recent stay through the new years week.    6 of us attempted to collect a table to find that we had an hour wait.  That was fine, although it would have been better to have good cell phone service (thank you AT&T for sucking on that one) so that we received our table-ready text on time.    We were seated and spent some time joking with the waiter who was probably the best part of the experience.  Great guy.    In short, the food isn't great.  I wanted to LOVE it as I am interested in Gordon Ramsay's cooking, but honestly, if this food was something he tasted at another establishment, I can guarantee you that he'd be all over it with scoldings.   We ordered 6 burgers with various toppings, 3 orders of french fries and jalapeno poppers.  The best part of the meal was the poppers.    Each served in its own little shotglass of dip, they were tasty with a kick.   The burgers were overdone and dry (I asked for medium.. got well done, along with 4 other burgers).   The uber cheese, which was my selection was excellent in the taste of the cheeses but chowing down on a dry hunk of meat was less than thrilling.   The french fries were also quite overdone - hard and crunchy, lacking flavor, even with the spicy ketchups served with them.   We ordered 3 servings and MAYBE ate 1 entire serving across the 6 of us, when all was said and done.   Despite the lines to get in to this place, I'd skip it - it's just not worth it if a top-name restaurant can't deliver their food as the customer ordered it."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Our server, Matt, was exceptional. Food was pretty good. The wait time is just a little long but not a big deal."}
{"text":"Definitely the best burger I've had for a very very very long time. I had the one with the mushrooms and it was amazing. Cooked to perfection. The seasoning and the combination of ingredients had my mouth watering for every bite. I had a side order of the onion rings which was good as well, but it definitely took back seat to the burger.   I got there at about 11am on a Saturday. There was already a line, but since it was just me, I found a spot at the bar immediately. Highly recommended for anyone looking for one of the best burgers they'll have for a while."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait, unless you make reservations here, they are really racking in the business! Our wait wasn't too bad, to get in at least, about 40min. It took a half hour to get our food, but like I said, they are pretty busy, and our food was at least piping hot and fresh when we got it. We came here for the Restaurant Week deal, and I got the Parmesan Truffle fries with the Earth burger, my boyfriend got the Euro burger and the fries as well. The fries are amazing! I've never had truffle fries before, so I was pretty blown away by these. They come  with their own truffle sauce and a house made ketchup, but the fries taste really good with their corresponding truffle one. They are huge steak fries, and they give you a lot of them The Earth burger is a portabella mushroom with some melty cheese and tomato. It wasn't the best I have had, yet it was not the worst. It was really disappointing though, since there is SO much you can do with veggie burgers, but oh well.  The dessert was a sticky toffee pudding push pop, very much like the childhood Flintestone pops, with a salted peanut ice creamed layered with a toffee cake. Pretty darn good, but I didn't like the combination much. The salty ice cream with the sweet cake would sound great, but they didn't mix very well with me. I would prefer the cake by itself and leave the ice cream. My boyfriend loved his Euro burger, and the fries, but the prices outside of this week's deal, and the wait, will keep us away for a while."}
{"text":"Onion Rings and Truffle Parmesan Fries were so greasy we sent them back; not something we normally do.  Burgers (Farm & Hell's Kitchen) were bland; a little salt & pepper would have helped greatly.  Good selection of draft beers; server was above average."}
{"text":"Went here on a date night in Vegas with my fiancé. There was a bit of a line getting in but it moved quickly.  Upon being seated the waitress was pleasant but kind of intrusive. We were having a polite conversation about a mild disagreement and she kept literally leaning her head down into our discussion bubble without making herself known beforehand. She would walk up to my back and lean down before I could tell she was there. Awkwaaaaard.  We ordered onion rings as an app. They were hella greasy and gave me a headache. Some really oily fried foods do that. Most don't. But these did. The onion rings sauces were ketchup (weird choice to me) and an unexceptional ranch of mild and weak flavor. We asked for BBQ mustard and it was a slight improvement, no noticeable BBQ flavor though, it wasn't smokey or anything.  My fiancé ordered some drinks and I sipped his blood orange Cosmo and LOVED it! I normally hate cocktails so that was a happy surprise!!  We ordered the Britannia burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger.  My Britannia burger came with arugula, cheddar, and a mango chutney. The burger it's self was really well cooked and perfectly \"to order\". It had a mildly charbroiled taste which I appreciate. I adored the puffy and light bun. The mango chutney was barely present. I ordered extra on the side and then it was great. The side of chutney had visible mango strips in it where as my burger didn't originally have any. The big issue with the sandwich was the arugula which quickly wilted and then created horrific stringy bites which had an awful mouth feel and would flop out in wilted strings when I bit down and pulled away. I just scrapped it off and it was improved. I would get butter lettuce subbed in next time.  My fiancé's Hell's Kitchen burger was really mild shockingly for the description. He said it was okay/good.   We shared fries which came with chipotle and curry ketchups. My fiancé loved the curry and fries but I thought they were meh. I am a fry fan so I was hoping for something better. They reminded me of high temperature deep fried frozen bagged steak fries, to be honest. Sorry Gordon  I feel bad confessing that.  Lastly we ordered shake number three. And this shake was the worst shake I have had. It was supposed to be banana with butterscotch pudding on top. The pudding was exceptionally grainy. As though it was made with instant jello brand pudding mix but they didn't put enough milk in or stir rigorously and had grainy bits of pudding mix incessantly through out. The shake was weirdly watery tasting. And had virtually no banana flavor. I saw on the menu it also had strawberry and chocolate. Those flavors weren't powerful but they overpowered the banana. Lastly, the shake got lost in the hectic kitchen comings and goings. A small delay, now worries: BUT--- The manager came over and explained this and revealed that it had sat on a shelf for several minutes and been shuffled around and then stuck in a fridge. Really???? You couldn't just make a fresh shake after that? I think the excessive sitting out could have contributed to the watery-ness a little but the flavor was utterly lackluster on its own regardless. And I have never been served grainy pudding in my whole life so that was new. I sent the shake back and declined a replacement after trying it and they did remove it from the bill but the whole thing was too bizarre.  Would I come back? Yes if my fiancé asked to but not on my own. Waaaay over priced for the quality of items. The Prime Burger restaurant in the Venetian food court area served a far more flavorful burger shockingly."}
{"text":"Default Rating: When there is a big time fail this is the rating any restaurant deserves. I could have gotten really sick. It was just a few hours of diarrhea. But one star it is.   \"The pork was so raw...it's still singing Hakuna Matata!\"  \"The pork was so raw...a skilled vet could still save it!\"  Warning:  \"Notice: The consumption of raw or undercooked eggs, meat, poultry, seafood or shellfish may increase your risk of foodborne illness.\"  Diarrhea: Yup, this is a one star review for one reason. \"diarrhea\". Can you say diarrhea in a yelp review? I don't know but we'll find out. Did you know that the public restrooms at the Bellagio are really nice? Well, they are great bathrooms and I am grateful that they were there just at the right time.  Hot Mess/Hog Burger: My wife ordered this burger and noticed it was pink in the middle. So she handed it to me and said \"it's pink in the middle, I can't eat it.\" Not realizing it was a pork burger, I also didn't realize that it was wrapped in undercooked bacon. I honestly thought that it was a rare beef burger and figured that was how they served them here. They didn't ask how she wanted it cooked and usually she clarifies \"well done\"  with the waitress when ordering. so I thought it was odd that she ended up with a rare burger.  I took a few bites of it and gave her half of my veggie burger. I didn't care for it and eventually noted the wrapping of undercooked bacon. Why did I even try a few bites of this??  It didn't hit me till a little later. But it did....across the street at the Bellagio. We had to hurry inside to find a restroom after the water fountain show.   We actually had a pretty good time visiting Burgr. We were up for a celebrity restaurant and we wanted one that was not too expensive and more importantly one that had a meatless option for me. We were seated quickly and sat next to a cute young couple who had just received their food and my wife spotted their hog burgr and thought that would be a good one to order.   Food: I ordered the veggie burger \"Earth Burger\" with a portabella mushroom. That was a great burger and my wife enjoyed half of it. 5 Stars for one of the best meatless burgers that I've ever had. And I am an expert on veggie burgers!  We also got the sweet potato fries but we both thought these were way too sweet. Personally,  I didn't care for them and wouldn't recommend them. We also got a \"shake\" #3 (Shake #3 Butterscotch pudding + banana shake (walnuts, strawberry, chocolate) + snickerdoodle cookie). That was a 5 Star shake. The cute couple saw us get this and they ordered one too.  Venue: Nice place. I thought the gas burning wall thing was wasteful but who the hell cares, it's vegas. Frack the hell out of vegas and give us a wall of gas.   Service: I'm sure we just got the luck of the draw. But, really lady it's time to move on and while you are at it take the guy in the kitchen who has better things to do than cook pork burgers all the way through. Everyone else seemed to be pleasant and friendly. But, Burgr might have lost a star on her indifferent service.  Anyway, we had a good time with our veggie burgr and thick shake and meeting the shy but friendly couple next to us. We were in the mood to have a good time. Hope Mr. Ramsey finds time to oversee the operation of this restaurant a little more often."}
{"text":"Sergio was our waiter and he was amazing! Tried the best beer of the century, thanks to him"}
{"text":"I got the duck burger protein style, it was my first time trying my burger like this, however hit up the buffet the day before and couldn't think of eating bread. One of the best burgers I have ever tasted(best is still Bad Apple Burger in Chi-Town)!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are huge fans of burgers...and huge fans of Burgr. Expect a wait, particularly during high season. Simply give your name to the hosts and they'll give a buzzer. They seem to move people quickly, we've never waited more than 20 minutes to get a table. Service is efficient and friendly. You MUST try the Euro Burger and the garlic aoli fries. I recommend ordering medium - medium rare. Anything more and the burgers tend to come out a little dry."}
{"text":"We had the Farmhouse burger and the Ale dawg. Burger was very flavorful and juicy, bun retained its structure not falling apart at all. Dawg was equally great not greasy at all and for a bacon wrapped beef dawg that is not easy to do. The only thing better was our server who never let my beverage glass get low without bringing a refill and offering advice on menu questions we had,"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quality burger and amazing appetizers. There truly is no better place for a burger in Vegas. Good service and good beer selection."}
{"text":"I always was fan of chef Ramsey Gorgon and his television shows about master cooking. Therefore, it was an honor to visit one of his restaurant and make sure how delicious can simple meal like burgers be. We ordered classic burgers and potato fries with truffles which were so delicious. The burgers were made perfectly, the taste was juicy and unbelievable. The truffles made potato fries special and have nothing to do with simple fries which are offered in every restaurant. The price was higher than average but if taking account pleasure which we got from the meals we never sorry about it. I highly recommend the restaurant to everyone who likes gourmet tasting burger!!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this for a long time and i think the anticipation might have ruined my experience haha I shared a Farm burger and a hot dog with my gf and both were really good. The burger didn't really stand out from other gourmet burgers, BUT i will say it was good just not the best i've ever had. the hot dog was a bit more unique, but when i read the description in the menu it sounded like it would be better then it actually tasted. Overall, the food was good, the ingredients were fresh, kind of pricey for my taste, but definitely a place you have to at least try once. I do believe my expectations were way too high, but you might have a different opinion."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was cool. The only bummer with the atmosphere was they left a part of the wall open which connects to the casino so it smells like smoke. The waitress was friendly and great. The hotess was okay. Almost had an entitlement attitude, smilled slightly.  The food tasted great, my wife and I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger. The drop in star was for a few reasons, one no kids menu- really?? No where in the restuaurant says grown-ups only or not family freindly. Do you not like kids Mr. Ramsey?? You too good for kids??  Number two, the burgers don't come with French fries...you have to buy then separately. Sorry but if I am going to spend 15 to 18 dollars on a burger I'd expect French Fries to come with it. Number three, Mr. Ramsey, your a chef...you can make ketchup without the use of HFCS? Since you are a well known chef and fix up restaurants I expected more. Sorry. But seriously add a kids menu..they deserve love too. Figured a four star is fair enough."}
{"text":"I cannot wait for somebody to ask me to recommend a restaurant to them because I will say \"Go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR! You won't regret it\".   My boyfriend and I came here on Wednesday night around 9:30 and we were seated right away. The host led us to our table and I noticed that there were booth seating. I asked if we could sit at a booth and she said there were none available but they did have half booth/half open seating which we took.  We sat for a good 10 minutes before a waitress came over and asked us if anyone had come to our table yet. We said no, and she said she'll get someone right over. A couple of minutes later, I see a waiter and waitress talking, kinda pointing at us. The waiter, I believe his name was Kevin, came over and apologized to us for having to wait. I guess there was confusion as to who would be our waiter/waitress. Honestly, my boyfriend and I were busy talking so the wait didn't bother us too much.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my boyfriend got the Chanterelle Burger. And we ordered \"Just Fries\" to go with our burgers and the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers for an appetizer. By the way, the Poppers came with a surprise... a good fiery surprise!   I took a bite of my burger and I thought it was absolutely amazing! It was cooked medium well and to perfection. I could see the perfect amount of pink in the meat; it was juicy and full of flavor. And the buns were fresh and soft. I don't think I've ever had a burger that good! Oh, my boyfriend enjoyed his burger as well. The fries were tasty but we were getting really full so we didn't finish them.  Our waiter was so friendly and nice! We could tell he was busy but he took his time to explained to us the interactive drink menu and he checked up on us the right amount of times.  There are plenty of TV's inside this restaurant... maybe place a bet at the sportsbook and then come here to watch the game while enjoying a delicious burger and cold beer."}
{"text":"The burger restaurants in order of preference: 1. Bachi burger 2. Holsteins 3. Burgr  Branded items on the strip obviously come with a premium price as well.  The burgers here were about $15 and side items like fries and onion rings were about $10 but definitely big enough to share between 2.  There is a total rewards discount of $1 off each menu item.  Given the prices, the flavors were a little lack luster.  I tried the farm burger with duck breast bacon, aged sharp cheddar, and a fried egg.  While the burgers were cooked to perfection, the farm burger flavor balance leaned toward the salty side because of the duck breast bacon.  The buns seem pretty typical as well.  The other burger I tried was the chanterelle burger with chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, and fig jam.  The flavor profile on this one leaned towards the too sweet side.  Overall, there didn't seem to be a balance in the flavors in the burgers here compared to Bachi burger or even Holstein's.  There seems to be more creativity in the burgers at the other two places.  I was quite disappointed by the truffle fries, they remind me of the red robin fries with fresh grated Parmesan on top and a hint of truffle oil.  But honestly Red Robins may do it better...the fries had a strange grainy rubbery texture.  The Maui onion rings were also just regular onion rings with Parmesan on top but the cheddar ranch dipping sauce was packed with flavor and delicious.  We also tried the sticky toffee pudding pops with salted peanut ice cream.  The way the item is presented in layers, you have to eat the ice cream and the sticky toffee pudding separately when the two of them actually taste better when eaten together.  The ambience of the place reminds me of a sports bar, the service was excellent...but I probably won't make a repeat visit.  Bachi burger is still my place for gourmet burgers without the added price tag of being a restaurant on the Strip."}
{"text":"Being a chef from Houston, that loves burgers but can appreciate the craft... 2 thumbs up... the Farmers Burger was amazing... with the duck breast bacon... wow... oh the curried ketchup surprised me as well..."}
{"text":"The most average burger I've ever had. And I've had a lot of burgers across the US. Waited twenty minutes to get a seat and when we walked in, there were at least 15 open tables and booths total. Absolutely no reason to have a waiting line when the establishment is less than 2/3s full. Ordered the American and was immediately disappointed. So average for even a national chain. Fries were decent although they were borderline room temperature. GF ordered the fish and chips. Batter was good but fish was mushy. No firmness at all. I can't think of any reason to ever return with all of the other options you have on Vegas. Pretty disappointing experience. The service from our server was over the top though. She was very pleasant and very attentive. She's the reason I  giving three stars. On food alone I would only have given two. Explore other option before eating here."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best burger I've ever eaten.  I had the HK burger and my wife had the Brittania, and both of them were flat-out phenomenal.  \"It's cooked beautifully\" (in my best GR voice.  The servers are very attentive, the pricing isn't bad ($15 for this burger wasn't out of line, IMHO), and everything about the restaurant smacks of attention to detail.    Try the sweet potato fries.  Absolutely delicious.    This place is worth the wait.  You could also wait until after midnight, usually there's no line by then."}
{"text":"If you're a party of 2, 3, or 4 you will most likely have a 30-45 minute wait during typical lunch and dinner times. Thankfully we had a group of 7 and they sat us right away. Also, burgers take 30 minutes once you order so this isn't somewhere to come if you're in a hurry.  However, the food is so worth the wait. Every bite was amazing and the service was excellent. These were the best sweet potato fries I've ever had because they're coated in powdered sugar :) We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay's name is like a brand name. Just as people pick up Michael Kors purses for themselves, they want to try Gordon Ramsay's food, then post pictures and review it (like I am now!).   Make sure you check in with the hostess before standing in line. The line is actually meant for groups of 2 or less. And trust me, there will probably be a line. Members of the Planet Hollywood club get seated right away. If you have more than 2 people, they will take your name down. I went during lunchtime. The wait for 3+ was 1 hour and half. The wait for 2 people was 20-30 minutes.  We were given the option to sit at the back bar, and took it, just to sit down sooner. Honestly, though, it was the best option! We sat literally in front of the kitchen and were able to see the chefs work. By the way, the executive chef at BurGR right now is Christina Wilson, winner of season 10 of Hell's Kitchen. From what I know, she won the position of executive chef at Gordon Ramsay's Steak and then came to BurGR afterwards.   My boyfriend and I decided to splurge. We both ordered shakes. I got the banana shake topped with butterscotch pudding and snickerdoodle cookie. The banana shake and the cookie were AMAZING. The butterscotch pudding was WAY too sweet though. My boyfriend ordered the oreo shake topped with creme brulee pudding, oreo, and a little bit of bruleed sugar. I LOVE LOVE LOVED this one. I don't even like oreo shakes, but the creme brulee pudding on top was just awesome.  We also ordered the beer battered Maui onion rings topped with parmesan-reggiano served with curry ketchup and a Chipotle ranch dip. I will preface this by saying that I usually hate beer battered onion rings, primarily because more often than not, the batter is not crispy the way I like it. This one was SO GOOD. I think it was my favorite thing of the entire dining experience!!! The other side we ordered was the truffle parmesan fries with truffleoil, truffle salt, and truffle aioli. It was honestly nothing special. I would have been fine with the regular fries.  As for the burger, we both ordered the farm burger. The patty is made of short rib, beef chuck, and brisket cooked to a medium rare. It is topped with a sharp English cheddar cheese, fried eggs, and... DUCK BREAST BACON... and placed between house-made toasted sesame buns. I wish I could get duck breast bacon to cook up and eat at home for breakfast... so delicious! It wasn't the best burger I've had, though... Those honors remain with the Office Burger at Father's Office in Los Angeles!!!  I wanted to order the toffee bread pudding push pops, especially because I've tried his toffee bread pudding at another restaurant before... but I was so full after all the other yumminess, that I just couldn't do it.  Overall, though,, a great experience. It was just a fun time, and I'm going to dream about the onion rings forever!"}
{"text":"Excellent food overall and really good service at a pretty reasonable price. The shakes are really good, the fries and onion rings delicious and of course the burgers were great. Perfectly cooked. Get here when they open or be prepared to wait a long long time."}
{"text":"It was our first time here... For a Friday night we only waited 20 minutes to be seated which is really good. The restaurant was packed but they managed to get us seated. The staff was friendly. We ordered the Euro Burger, uber burger, Maui onion rings, truffle fries and the Oreo creme brûlée shake to share. Everything was absolutely delicious. This restaurant is definitely on my top 5 favorite restaurants. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"This review will reflect our recent visit on 10/21/14 as well as one other visit about a year prior.  Having been to a few of Gordon's restaurants (Maze in NYC, BurGR in Vegas, Gordon Ramsay Steak in Vegas) one thing I notice every time is the consistency of both service and quality.  There has never been a hiccup.  You can tell that he demands a certain level of service and thankfully it is carried out 100% of the time.  BurGR is set in a casual location near the front of Planet Hollywood casino, just off of the strip.  The decor is cool and hip, with an open plan...big TVs surrounding the dining room, and a clear view from all seats back to the kitchen.  The service, as mentioned, is top notch.  You are greeted warmly by everyone you encounter, and even though this is a \"burger joint\" kind of feel, the staff is on a 5 star restaurant level.  The food is as awesome as you anticipate.  We've had a few different burgers here...the Hell's Kitchen (asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avacado, oven roasted tomato)...the American (american cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion)...and the Chanterelle (chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, figgy-onion jam)...as well as the truffle parmesan fries (hand cut fries, truffle parmesan, truffle salt, truffle aioli).  My favorite is probably the Hell's Kitchen, but you know you're eating an incredible burger when you get a simple American style and it tastes amazing.  Everything was cooked to perfection (medium...even though the chef recommends medium rare) and the buns are as tasty as you can get.  For desert, we've had the sticky pudding pops twice.  This is a tough one to review.  If you haven't had his normal sticky toffee pudding, you'll love these pops!!  They are fun, delicious and a cool twist on a classic.  However, if you've had his REAL sticky toffee pudding (with that salted caramel ice cream that comes in the shape of a butter stick) you might be a bit disappointed!  But hey..his original sticky toffee pudding is the BEST dessert you can get, period. (Seriously..it's worth a trip to the bar at Gordon Ramsay Steak just to order it)  Anyway, Gordon delivers the goods here at BurGR.  The prices are in line with the food quality (burgers are in the 13-15 range) and the experience is top notch.  You simply cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"The farm burger is my fav, I practically inhaled it the last time I had it. It comes with duck bacon and a fried egg, cant anyone ask for more?  The truffle fries however, were a bit undercooked..."}
{"text":"Not very impressed by the burger and the sauce ! The special sauce for the sweet potato fries was too sugary and sweet and didn't go with the fries at all."}
{"text":"I would have given this restaurant five stars for the well executed burger and onion rings but a mishap with service brought the rating down. We began with an order of onion rings as an appetizer.  It was likely the best we have ever eaten. We did not care for the special chipotle ketsup so we asked for regular. Next we split the Farm Burger and fries. The burger was delicious. The egg bun was excellent with two types of sesame seeds. The burger was cooked perfectly and included a duck bacon and fried egg. We then realized that the busboy had removed our previously requested ketsup. We asked for more but while we waited the burger and fries started to get cold. Timing was off and it ruined the experience of the meal. The waitress deducted the fries but in the end, the meal just wasn't enjoyed. Skip this place and go to ShakeShack instead at New York New York. Half the price and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's in the Planet Hollywood casino, right beneath Koi. You can't miss it with the waves of flames showcasing the restaurant. There was a pretty long line, I'm not sure why, because we walked up to the front, put our names down with the host and got a text when our table was available. We never asked why they were in line...I guess we'll never know :P  So our group of six sat down after about 30 minutes, not too bad. We ended up sharing the jalapeno poppers, not too spicy, even a wimp like me could handle these. The catch was that one of the six had all the jalapeno seeds stuffed in it. Thankfully I avoided this tragic fate, because I probably would have been in the bathroom for the rest of the night, dropping off fireballs. I'm terrible with spicy haha.  We also got the truffle fries (YES, AMAZING), onion rings (crunchy, but still flavorful, not the over-fried dry onions that you can sometimes run into), and regular fries (meh, OK). I got the Britannia burger, which I highly recommend. Sharp cheddar with mango chutney. MANGO? In a burger? YES and it works so well! Not too sweet, but just enough flavor to make you go, ohhh, yesssss. I was definitely surprised, in a good way :D  Overall, food was delicious, service was excellent, pricing was reasonable, especially for a Vegas meal."}
{"text":"Ate here on a gambling business trip. Line up was quite long, but it was well worth the wait. After an hour, me and my bud were seated, and was presented with a wide selection of brews on a ipad. After selecting our drinks, we chose different burgers. I chose the hell's kitchen burger and it was amazing. You know how some burgers drip all this shit on a plate when you bite into it, but this burger was contained. All the juice was soaked into the patty, and each bite was great. The fries though sucked ass, but I came here for the burger."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant in a great part of the strip.  The fire on the outside wall just sucked us right in.  Noisy, busy, crowded and didn't think much of the high-top dining.  Our server was wonderful, the burger was ok, the shake was really good, but the price, oh the price..  That was the most memorable part.  Let's just say that even for a cool new place on the strip I found the price to be a bit much for what we got.  As a local, would i go back?  Yes - as long as I wasn't picking up the bill."}
{"text":"What an amazing meal. From the attentive service to the food which was amazingly good. Will definitely come back as many times as I can. If you are visiting Vegas you got to go here to eat and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"This place has an annoying wait, but most people don't seem to realize that you DON'T HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE. You can put your name and cell phone # down at the front and they will txt you when your table is ready. The burgers, fries and cocktails are excellent and definitely worth eating here for. It wasn't the greatest burger I've ever had in my life, but it was close. Very close."}
{"text":"Not much of a Gordan Ramsy fan or watch his shows but I gave this place a try since I'm all about my burgers. This restaurant is tucked away near one of the entrances inside of Planet Hollywood. If you're playing tourist in Vegas I think this is one of the many good places to get you're foodie on. But this place is pretty pricey because everything is sold separately. Burgers and fries don't come together as a combo. Looking at the menu you gotta ignore the prices and just enjoy the food. This restaurant is strictly made for burgers as the entrees but there are fries, salads, and bomb shakes. I thought this place wasn't gonna be worth the money but it was actually good food for a change. One thing I hate being in Vegas is paying for overpriced food and it wasn't even enjoyable. That's the worst lol. I've only been there twice and only tried two of their fries, two of their shakes, and one of their burgers on both visits, the American burger. The place is pretty big but their are still lines but it's not too much of a wait. Will definitely try something different on my next visit though."}
{"text":"Given his three shows on Fox, I had long been curious about Gordon Ramsay and his cooking.  It's clear he knows his stuff (hence the yelling), but backing it up is another thing.  Despite my curiosity though, we didn't plan on hitting up two of his restaurants (GR Pub and Grill was the other)...but it certainly worked out well!  While I liked the decor and service (our waitress Tammy was super friendly...and funny), let's be honest - Gordon Ramsay's name and food is what people really care about here.  Compared to the other burger joints I've tried in Vegas (Holstein's and BLT Burger), BurGR's menu options aren't quite as plentiful.  However, for what they may have lacked in quantity, they certainly made up for in quality.  -- FARM BURGER with Duck Breast Bacon, English Sharp Cheddar, and a Fried Egg...$15/$14** (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#sBOTjyHkhxZRVOLVnCLvsA) The black and white sesame bun was pretty different visually and I liked how soft it was.  The patty was both moist and flavorful and while I would have preferred pork, the duck bacon went well with the egg and cheese.  Pretty tasty overall.  -- TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES with Truffle Parmesan, Truffle Salt, and Truffle Aioli...$11/$10** (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#czEJpJ9QxE-ALZlpWMgZ6Q) The fries were cut a little larger than I expected, but they were still so crispy and delicious.  Just loaded with truffle flavored goodness.  Definitely recommended.  -- SWEET POTATO FRIES with Vanilla Powdered Sugar & Honey Jalapeno Mayo...$9/$8** (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#xl00KTbEFS-UTX4o0wVLoQ) While the Parmesan Fries were a hit, this one completely missed.  Since the fries are naturally sweet already, adding the powdered sugar was overkill.  The five of us only ate a third of it before giving the rest to our friends that came in after us.  **NOTE: Menu prices are slightly cheaper if you have a Total Rewards player's card.  Given Gordon Ramsay's burgeoning popularity, there's typically a wait for a table, but make a reservation at the hostess stand and you won't be tethered to standing in the line the whole time.  Even if you don't though, the burgers at BurGR are worth the wait.  Now to try Gordon Ramsay Steak to complete my set!"}
{"text":"Ramsay can be an ass - but this spot definitely isn't.  Gordon Ramsay BurGR in Planet Hollywood is my go-to burger spot in Vegas whether sober or intoxicated. This past weekend - for a bachelor party was my 3rd time and it was the third straight five-star experience. I stuck with the Britannia Burger, which has English sharp cheddar, mango chutney, and arugula. The burger lacks a punch with its mango chutney but the succulence of the main part of the burger along with my favorite burger or pizza addition: argula, makes this a prime-time 'gr.   Make sure you get yourself some truffle fries, too. They're rich."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay's BurGR was an interesting experience. Take everything you know about an average burger joint and take it up a notch from flavor to price.   The restaurant itself reminds me of a Cheesecake Factory location and there was a 20-30 min wait to be seated on a Sunday afternoon. The average price for a burger is $15 and that doesn't include fries or drinks.  I opted in for the Hell's Burger or whatever it's called but it's suppose to be spicy and I love spicy. (It wasn't) I was with a group of 4 and we ordered the gooey fries and regular fries to share. The fries portion was huge, so unless you can eat a cow in one sitting, I suggest you order one to share.   Service was great. Our server helped by suggesting what to order and was helpful through out the dinner experience.   The only thing I would have to ding them for is the wait time to get the food to our table. I think we waited 30-40 mins to receive our food. Altogether we spent roughly an hour and a half to two hours there, now that's a long ass time.   The food was good. The flavors were unique, fresh and basically tasted like a $15 dollar burger. But at the same time I'm not that crazy about it to give it 5 stars. It was good but didn't exactly give me that burger satisfaction I've had before at other places. Just not as juicy as I would've had wanted.   The highlight for me had to be the gooey fries - so good! Crispy thick fries, drizzled over with loads of cheese, bacon, and an EGG! So rich but so good.    Would I be back? Yeah"}
{"text":"We ate here today for lunch with high expectations from the four star yelp rating. This restaurant missed the mark on food and focused too much on the Vegas decor.    We ordered the Hell's Kitchen,  Classic American burger, and Parmesan truffled fries. The fries were served cold and looked like potato wedges. We had to ask the server for a fresh batch but the second serving wasn't much better, lacking the truffle flavor.   We asked the waiter what type of beef was being served but he couldn't answer.   The burgers were mediocre at best. It lacked some sort of sauce..... Maybe aioli.   Overall I wouldn't recommend waiting in line and dinning here. I'm disappointed in the food and lack of flavors given all the Ramsay hype. Check out Umami at the SLS instead. They serve organic high quality beef for the same price point and taste 1000 times better."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times, and have loved it every single time. Except this time... The bald Asian General Manager is no longer there and the place has gone down hill since then. Our food took over 30 minutes to get to us, not to mention our food was cold..! 3 tables that ordered their food after us, finished their food and left before we even received our food. The \"new\" GM apologized for our extensive ticket time and wished us a tasty meal. The food itself was good, but don't tell me it'll be out in 15 min when it's going to take 45-50 minutes. The management needs some attentions ASAP!!!!!!!! Get the big Asian back in the house because the short Caucasian guy with the glasses isn't cutting it. He didn't make a good experience for my friends bday weekend/ first time dining there.. PS: the waitress Cali is awesome, request her if you can"}
{"text":"The chanterelle burger can't be missed. Order the onion rings, too, and you'll be in heaven. They're beer battered, and probably the best I've ever had. The sauces they're served with are delectable.   There are 30 beers on tap as well. Don't fill up, as the sticky toffee pudding pops are a must."}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping and sightseeing in Vegas, i decided to try out this burger joint for dinner. Standing in a long line it looked like this place was awesome. Unfortunately, it was not. The burger was ok (Hells Kitchen Burger). I requested my burger well done, i got a medium/well pinkish patty. It also needed a little salt. I also got the appetizer jalapeno poppers. Not all that either. Overall, it was ok. It just needed something else... Dont think i'll be coming back..."}
{"text":"The wait to get in was surprisingly short and they text you, so you don't have to stick around - nice. However, it took close to 40 min to get our food after placing our order. It was busy, but it didn't look crazy busy so I'm not sure what the deal was that day. The truffle fries weren't cooked right - mealy versus creamy - and I barely noticed the truffle (which might have been on purpose). The burgers were good but I asked for side of mayo and it had that weird yellow glossy cover it gets when it's out too long. All in all, it was okay but not great."}
{"text":"I was wrong that this was a fun and casual place to take my family for my birthday dinner a few week ago.  It is not kid friendly.  Do not do this to yourself.  At $3.50 for drinks and $10 for a hot dog, you will regret bringing your kids.  Don't do it.  I want to come back with just the husband.  I think the burgers are amazing tasting.  The truffle fries have a perfect taste.  Don't say no to the sticky toffee pops.    So, you pay for the hipster cool vibe and the Gordon Ramsey name.  I am willing to give it another try without the distractions of kids.  Date night in a few months?  Perhaps."}
{"text":"In the land of overpriced and over-hyped restaurants, I'd have to give a big thumbs up to Gordon Ramsay Burgr for pleasantly surprising our group with delicious and moderately priced food.   It was close to 11:30 on a Sunday night when the gang and I ventured down to PH for dinner. We were seated after a quick 5 minute wait without any shade thrown our way even though it was 30 mins to closing. Kudos for that!   Here's what we ordered:  Jalepeno Poppers -- MUST  Pork Belly Baos -- Meh, can be skipped Chicken Wings -- also meh and skippable Farm Burger -- YES! Burger topped with an egg-- what could go wrong with it? Oreo Shake topped with creme brulee -- it was good but too much creme brulee on top  The best part? The pricing was affordable. Good food without a hefty price tag? So rare on the strip!  *Be sure to show your Total Rewards Card for a slight discount on the food!"}
{"text":"Glad we stopped here.  Excellent burger & onion rings.  They lost our order but apologized and gave a free drink. Still very good and service was great too."}
{"text":"Definitely yummy but overpriced. A place to cross off your list of Vegas things to do, however if I'm going to pay that kind of price I rather it be for a place with a reputable name chef."}
{"text":"Nicestttttt people. Just the nicest. Not pretentious like in NY.  But the food???  OMGGGGG. The fries with the salami are incredible - inventive - the smartest thing I've seen in food in a long time. The pudding shakes are the bomb too!  And the burgers are superbbbbbb. What an experience. Cant say enough about this place. Bravo, Gordon Ramsey. Bravo!"}
{"text":"The food is 5 stars all the way... so yummy! Our experience was only 2 star service. Over all, a 3.5 star review.  As a big fan of Gordon Ramsay, we'd been anxious to try this place. With Mom in town it seemed like the perfect occasion. We went at a sort of off time (3:00 in the afternoon) so we got in and were seated right away. All of the food around us lookd delicious so I could not wait to take my first bite.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($14) as did Mom. I ordered mine medium, she ordered hers well done with no tomatoes. The bf ordered The Farm Burger ($15) and we shared an order of Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11).  My burger was perfect! So tasty and super spicy from the jalapenos. The bf's burger was even better (we shared), which was a relief because I was worried about how the duck breast bacon would taste. The fries were equally delicious, with just the right amount of truffle flavor. Unfortunately Mom's burger came out bloody pink inside when she'd ordered it well done. I thought at fist they must have mixed up our burgers but then realized she had asked for no tomatoes and mine had them so that wasn't the case at all. Mom was polite and ate 1/2 of her burger without complaining. When she refused to eat the other half because it was rare I decided to say something. I pulled the waitress over and told her, she had not been attentive up to this point, we'd even had to flag down someone else for refills on our drinks. She didn't take any responsibility for the mistake and said she'd have a manager come talk to us. A manager never came by and eventually she returned with our bill. I then asked to speak to a manager, at which point she said she took the burger off the bill. Ok fine.  I paid, and I tipped off of the price of the entire meal before the burger had been removed, even though I didn't really want to. After she returned to pick up the check we asked about the prices in the menu, why most everything showed one price and then next to it a dollar less. She explained that with a PH rewards card we saved a dollar on each item... would have been nice if she'd told us anytime before we'd already paid. We whipped our card out and she returned with $3... that would have been $3 less I would have tipped on. Whatever..  I hope if we ever return again the experience is far better."}
{"text":"This place is really bad  Waited 20 min to get a table and there another 30 min to get the burgers  The burgers were badly over cook!!! I now tried 3 Gordon ramsay restaurant and I must say they were all bad The only good thing was the waiter that was really nice"}
{"text":"I went here last week before attending a show at Planet Hollywood and was not impressed by the overall dining experience.  First, there was a really long wait although plenty of tables were available for seating.  Second, it took equally long for our food to arrive once we ordered.  Third, the burgers we had were okay, but not worth the price we paid.  Fourth, the truffle fries were great, but if that is the best part of your meal then it's safe to say it was an underwhelming experience.  In the end, with tax and tip included our meal, which consisted of two burgers, one order of fries, and one iced tea, came out to over $50.  I don't think I'll be going back.  I'd rather eat at Stripburger or Bachi Burger any day compared to Gordon Ramsay BurGR."}
{"text":"If we come back to Vegas, we'll definitely come back to Burgr. Delicious. Beautiful servers. Great service. A little pricey but week with it. Huge beer selection on tap."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and this place did not disapppoint. From service to drinks to sides (the chips and curry sauce are a must!) to the main course - the burgers- this place was amazing and won't let you down.   I had the blue cheese burger, and it was fabulous. This place oozed the passion, integrity, and attention-to-detail that Ramsay is known for. A brilliant place to celebrate my wife's birthday, and our server, Janet, was a treasure and a credit to this institution."}
{"text":"Been here a few times... Great choice if you're in vegas. I highly recommend the chicken wings. They come partially deboned and \"frenched\" which makes them very easy to eat. excellent flavors. Burgers are outstanding.. Cocktails are really good too. Good job on this one Gordon."}
{"text":"We came in on a busy Sunday night so we expected a long wait. There was a hostess at the front who explained the whole scenario to us and why we had to wait in line instead of getting on the list. Once she explained it to us, we felt a lot better about standing in line then getting a text message because we did not want to wait over an hour. She ended up being the girl who sat us. She recommended the truffle fries (which were delicious) and told us that one of us had to try the hells kitchen burger as well. We inquired her name and she said it was Sidney like Australia, but with an I. My wife thought that was cute and clever. We have read a few things on this page about how the hostesses are rude and ignore you, but she really changed that view point for us. She was actively engaging with us while walking us back to the table and even before that. We could feel the difference between the other girls who looked like it was frustrating talking to other people and with her. She was a good precursor to our server who was GREAT!  Next, our server Tammy was the icing on the cake! she also reassured us that we need to have the hells kitchen burger. She knew everything about her menu and answered all our questions. She convinced us to try the wings which we were not disappointed about. they give a tangy taste with some heat. I personally was not a fan of the blue cheese and if i came back I would omit that, but I am not a fan of blue cheese like my wife is. I got the hells kitchen burger and i loved every minute of it. the roasted jalapeño was great. I like spicy food and i did not think it was that hot, but it had enough heat that i could taste it. My wife had the Farm burger with the duck breast bacon and fried egg. She loved it. She was nervous about the bacon, but since we have gotten home she has been talking about finding some duck breast bacon to cook up.   Overall it was a great service that we experienced. That one hostess and our server really made our experience even better. We were expecting people to be yelling and causing a scene like you see in Gordon's show, but the atmosphere was really relaxed. It was a little loud, but what can you expect from a weekend dinner crowd with large parties. We can't wait to come back and we will be asking for Tammy again.   Recommendations: fury chicken wings, truffle fries, hells kitchen and farm burger."}
{"text":"Some damn good food. Yummy burgers with tasty truffle fries and bomb ass jalapeño poppers. Crème brûlée shake was delicious and in my opinion the best. The banana shake and #5 were decent. Wait was 30 mins."}
{"text":"Unimpressed.   Was quite excited to eat here because of the celebrity chef thing going on.   Service was prompt. Place was quite busy because of course it's in the center of the vegas strip in a busy mall. Drink menu was presented on an iPad which is becoming the new thing at most metropolitan and touristy places.   Got the Hell's Kitchen burger. I'm usually not a fan of jalapeños and avocado in my burger but I got it anyway because well I wanted to try the \"official\" burger. Regardless of my preferences for burger additives the beef was not really seasoned well. It was cooked good and the bun was good but the lack of seasoning made the entire experience bland.   The fries did not taste fresh. Despite dipping them in the accompanying sauces I couldn't really get myself to like them. Very dry.  The strawberry milkshake was good but it was just like any other good milkshake. Nothing to go crazy about.   Mediocre food. Extra charge for fries. Not really feeling it.   My waitress was super hot though. And nice. So that's a plus. And hot. Pleasant too. Did I mention she was hot?"}
{"text":"Awesome design in the restaurant front with lines of flames in the window. Similar to other restaurants on the strip, they have the system where you leave your number to be texted when a tables almost ready for you. We waited about 40 min but it was well worth it. The blue cheese chicken wing appetizer was solid and the burgers were very strong as well. My farm burger (duck breast bacon, sharp English cheddar, and fried egg) was cooked perfectly and the service was good as well. Drink menu offered via iPad which was a cool touch as well. Pricey but definitely pay a visit if you get a chance"}
{"text":"Seriously people go here!!!!! The fries are to die for especially the parmasean ones. The truffle dip is so good we had our waiter brings us more! Burgers were outstanding and the service was great. I mean everything was just outstanding about this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am not at all impressed with this place! The burgers are small and not as flavorful as I hoped for it to be. Nothing different than any other burger joint. Their drinks are freaking expensive, and didn't taste very good. Their fries were nothing to rave about either. Oh and their process of getting in line just to eat there were very confusing!!!  But waiter/server was good, fast, quick, and attentive.  However, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for BurGR, and while the meal was enjoyable I had to take down the rating a notch because of the horrible stomachache I had a couple hours after eating. I had the Euro burger, which included a roasted tomato, goat cheese, and arugula on top of the patty. I found the patty to be on the dry side, but the fixings were a fresh change. On the other hand, their truffle fries were really good as it was the first time I had truffle fries on thick-cut steak fries. My boyfriend also tried the Oreo milkshake with creme brulee, but while the Oreo portion was good, the creme brulee made the whole thing a little sickly sweet. In my opinion, Gordon Ramsay's name overhypes the place and you can definitely find better burgers in Vegas."}
{"text":"Had the fish burger  it wasn't what I expected it's more like a fish hotdog. It was a bit oily but Delish. No salt. The kids had some burgers and they were moist and Delish !"}
{"text":"Let me just say. REALLY GORDON RAMSAY?????? You expected this girl to think your burgers were off the hook and make you my number one burger place in Vegas with this week old meat,  Skimpy toppings and awful service. All I can say is shame on you. I have had better burgers at Bj's then at this place. I went here for my birthday too, so what a disappointment when the food was not great but it was already too late. Their fries are overpriced, don't come with the burgers and are basically mcdonalds fries. After following Ramsay's shows and eating at his other restuarants I was expecting so much more from the ambiance, the staff, the food. Really this place was an awful disappointment. If I want to pay $30 for a lunch I will go to a place worth that. This was not even worth $10. If you want a real burger on the strip go to STRIPBURGER BAR seriously."}
{"text":"I think that this is the best burger joint in Las Vegas because of the environment and flavor/taste/presentation of the food. I got try these items: - Farm Burger - Truffle Fries - Jalapeño Poppers  Everything was amazing and you must try these 3 items during your visit here. All my friends agreed that it was a good choice to come here. Their waiting process is very streamlined and they will text you when your table is near-ready. Conveniently there are lots of gambling tables 50 feet away while you wait.  After winning big at the tables, spend your hard earned cash at BurGR for a great food experience."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we had a chance to try one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants on our last trip to Vegas.  Arrived to BurGR about 1030pm and signed up for the text service and then sat and had a drink in the bar of the hotel.  Just as promised, we received a text in just under 45 minutes and returned to the restaurnt.  We were seated just in front of the fireplace - a little warm for my liking but gorgeous none the less.  Service was perfect and the food was pretty darn good.  With a group of 4 we all got to sample a fair bit.  The onion rings were delish and the burgers were definitely premium!  The only item I wouldn't order again is the Pigs in Blankets - just didn't do it for me.  Burgers were excellent and should be since it's their namesake ;-)  It's the kind of place I'm really glad we tried but I don't know that I'd come to again because there are so many great places to try when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went here with the family, so we're able to sample a few of Burgr's awesome burgers. I had the Euro burger with Aioli and goat cheese. It was perfect at medium rare. However, if a very slight gamey flavor is not your thing, then you should order something else.  If a punch of spice is more up your alley, then I would go with the Hell's Kitchen burger. The one my wife had was really good. But I still prefer the Euro Burger. If you're into a slightly sweet finish, then the Chanterelle would be perfect for you since it has a  figgy onion jam. This was my son's fave and I can attest to its goodness. In summary, the meats we're all perfectly cooked. And I would expect nothing less, otherwise I would have yelled \"you donkeys\", just like the owner.    The Parmesan Fries with skin was almost perfect. Almost since the serving was a mix of soft and slightly crispy fries. I prefer crispy.   Now is this burger better than the Umami's Manly Burger, I think the way the meat is cooked is in favor of Burgr, but Umami Manly has a slight edge in flavor."}
{"text":"Waiter: ALEX - Rating: F! I love Gorgon Ramsay, but this was complete and utter nonsense. We waited the 45 minutes for our table, ok no problem we will play slots until it's time to eat. We were sat down at 4:15 PM. He got our drinks in a timely manner. We ordered our food at 4:24 PM. Our food came at 5:07 PM.  Typically, I would understand, no problem, it was busy. However... We were not once checked on that entire time. Alex told us he would \"give us plenty of space\" and was in \"no rush\" which is not what I want to hear from my waiter.  We ordered two fries, one appetizer, and two burgers; so the appetizer should have came out at some point before 5:07. Our waiter was a complete @$$ to us for no reason. I don't know what his deal was. He had a table of 4 pretty girls, not something to be mad about. He was condescending, sarcastic, rude, slow, and had absolutely no class. This is Gordon freaking Ramsay's establishment in LAS f****** VEGAS, get some class!! Gordon has more class on Hell's Kitchen than this guy!   When our food came, they forgot the second order of fries. THREE different people came to tell us they were bringing our fries, none of which were Alex. Alex was busy flirting with a married woman for FIFTEEN minutes, in plain sight of her obviously pissed husband. He wasn't just annoyed, he was PISSED. Alex spent all his time at that table, and then the table behind us, then completely disregarded us. He walked right past us multiple times and purposely avoided eye contact. Um, WTF!?  Three waters were left unattended our whole visit, which is the assistant's fault, but if you're in the service industry you can see when our drinks need to be refilled. Take some initiative.  When our fries finally came, they were wrong. I wanted the just fries, we got truffle fries. Not what I asked for. They knocked off the fries on the bill which isn't what I asked for, I appreciated it but that doesn't change Alex's attitude.  When we asked him for the fries, he was incredibly sarcastic, rolled his eyes, and said \"I don't make the food.\" REALLY? I am well aware waiters are not cooks. He repeated himself about the fries being free multiple times, as if to say what more do you want me to do. He had absolutely NO class and NO initiative. When we asked if he had gotten our checks like we asked, he literally cocked his neck, looked at my best friend like she was stupid and said \"No, nobody told me that.\" The manager, Zach, seemed he could care less. His only explanation was \"it sounds like a lapse of service.\" Well no sh!t Sherlock. Will never recommend or come back to this place. If only Gordon was there, I would love to see him chew Alex out!"}
{"text":"Subpar at best. I have been wanting to taste a Gordon Ramsey owned restaurant for a long time and I have heard so much good reviews about this place. I was very disappointed at the end of the meal. I was expecting so much more from a well known chef. The taste of the food was good but the execution was not there at all. Maybe it was because we came at midnight but still doesn't give enough excuse to serve subpar food for a decent amount of money. We ordered the #4 Oreo  cremebrulee milkshake and at first it was really yummy. I liked the Oreo bottom of the milkshake better than the cremebrulee top of the milkshake. Second thing we ordered was the chicken sliders. Chicken was fried really well, still juicy inside. But it was super dry, did not taste the aioli or any sauce what so ever. I ordered the farm burger, I was excited to try out the duck bacon. The fried egg was so cold. The other burger we ordered was the chanterelle mushroom burger. There was still Rosemary sprigs in the burger. We found 3 stems in the burger. It was very unappetizing. The last thing we ordered was the Parmesan truffle fries. I looked over the kitchen and saw that all their fries was just under the warmer. Meaning they don't cook to order their fries. When we received it, it was so dry. It tasted like wood chips. Would not come back."}
{"text":"Hell's Kitchen burger=good! Euro burger= great! We had the oreo shake which was to die for. This place is great. It was rather pricey but normal for the las vegas strip. I did get the euro burger and I loved the goat cheese and truffle oil on it. I would recommend this place to anyone for lunch. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This happened at around 2:30 pm on New Year's Eve,  I have to say that my visit to this awesome restaurant was marred by watching one of its outside line girls accept a bribe.  What happened that the couple behind us learned together with us that the line was around one hour long.  The person behind us offered her ( and I could not see how much he gave her) some money.  She accepted and they cut to the front of the line and were whisked into the restaurant.  I know this goes on in a lot of places but I had not expected BurGR to have these types of employees.  I don't even expect anyone from this restaurant read this but I hope they do and take appropriate action.  Oh and we had the awesome Hells Kitchen burger and the truffle cheddar fries.  Enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to dine in on a Thursday night. Waited for a good 30 minutes and then we got seated. Our waitress I forgot her name. But she was sweet! She recommend me a hog burger which was pork so I gave that a try with duck Bacon. It was good. I don't think I've ever had a dam good burger before! I forgot what my boyfriend order but he loved it also! And the onion rings sure hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Very good. Slightly overpriced but worth it. Got the hog burger. Amazing. Definitely recommend the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"After being a Kitchen Nightmare fan for so long, I just had to stop in to one of Ramsay's places. Bugr had the best prices so we came here for lunch. The servers were very nice. We each ordered a burger and shared half with each other. The farm burger with the Duck bacon and fried egg was amazing. The sweet potato fries with vanilla infused powdered sugar was amazing. I only wished I would have ordered a milk shake because those looked really good. Every thing is done a la carte, but come on, it's Gordon Ramsay. Like he's going to serve a bad meal? We were very satisfied with everything."}
{"text":"It's the pinnacle of burger eating anywhere in the city and probably competitive with the best in the country.  The restaurant looks great and the bar is fun as would be expected from a Ramsay establishment.   Let's get to what matters, the noms:  -Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings. I saw someone post a review that said the onion rings were average. Lol stop. They are onion rings they obviously have a cap on how good they will ever be but these onion rings are up there at the top. Super fried and flavorful with tons of parmesan and the dip is pretty good.  -Piggies in a blank. These seem different than I remember they used to be pork belly buns. Those were great and competitive with what you could get at a good ramen bar for example.  -Chicken Sliders. Jesus. These are crazy good. I could probably nom down 4 orders of these for the whole meal that's how good. The fried chicken is so flavorful. Think chic fil a times infinity.   -Sweet potato fries and truffle fries. Both amazing. Sweet potato fries come with powdered sugar you can add as much as you want and a honey jalepeno sauce that is amazing. Truffle come with a pretty good truffle aoli.  -Hell's Kitchen Burger. My favorite by far. Jalepeno avocado tomatoes pesto etc etc etc. Just so good.  -Farm Burger. Super heavy and super delicious. Duck bacon need I say more?  -Hog Burger. This one is actually important. I remember trying this a while back and thinking huh that was a little underwhelming. And looking at the menu now it has different ingredients and is one of the few things they have changed. It now seems like it will pack much more of a punch which was my original criticism of it. Not saying that I got them to change the menu, I didnt complain about it cause it was still good. But seeing that a change has been made to something that I saw and assume others did as well proves this place is up to standard.  Yes the wait will always be long and I've never been seated immediately but you are on the strip so who cares. Go early, put your name down, and go drop money at the craps table like a boss. I'll see you there."}
{"text":"omg, I am going to move to Vegas for this restaurant. Afreakingmazing. My husband and i are huge Gordon Ramsey fans so we had to visit. We had the blood orange Cosmo, truffle fries, farm burger and hells kitchen burger, I think it was all delicious but the farm burger was out of this world! There was a thirty minute wait but it was so worth it! Can't wait to go back to Vegas for another round!!"}
{"text":"this place may be known for their burgers but the Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg. it's phenomenal!!"}
{"text":"You know, for Vegas this isn't badly priced! My bf and I love Gordon and his shows, and was excited to try this, and because my BF lovesss burgers. We were expecting like $20 for a burger, it was about $5 less, around $14-$17ish. The line looked very long, but we only waited for like 15-20 minutes. It wasn't a fancy burger place, we wore our regular clothes (shorts and a tee). Service was good.   I thought it was a great burger because 1. I finished it all 2. The buns didn't get soggy in like 5 seconds 3. The meat was very tender and flavorful 4. It was the right amount/portion 5. The bun was crispy or something was crispy that made it taste good  Also, share a basket of truffle fries! We didn't even finish it because it was soo thickly cut. The Parmesan cheese on it was veryyyy tasty.   It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Visited here over 4th of July weekend  We have about 30 minute wait which isn't bad when you have slot machines to keep you busy!  The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. You can tell they know a lot about their menu.   We had wings for appetizers and they had great flavor and just the right amount of crispness. We all ordered different burgers and all of us were sufficiently impressed. The frys were also crisp and seasoned well.   I had a special vodka infused pushpop for 4th of July desert. It was strong but still really tasty!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I decided to try this place out.  I was disappointed that when we got there it was over an hour wait .  Luckily, the bar area had two seats open so we decided to eat here instead of leaving.   When the food comes out the server gives a brief description of what you ordered.  I got the farm burger which was good but I ordered it medium and it barely had pink in it at all.  I hate it when my burgers are dry.  My boyfriend ordered the hell's kitchen burger and it had some spice to it, but there was just too much avocado.  The truffle parmesan fries were good, but not the best I've had.  I did enjoy the  handmade sauces that paired with the fries.  Overall the food was ok, but if this was an episode of Hell's Kitchen I'm sure Gordon Ramsay would be screaming at the cooks haha  On a good note, the servers/bartenders at the bar were nice and very personable to not only us but all the customers at the bar.  If you have a total rewards card you get a couple bucks off your meal.  If you want to try this place I would sit at the bar :)"}
{"text":"YES PLEASE. I swear i would be unhealthy if I lived by this place. Best burger EVER.  Every time I go to Vegas, I make sure I stop by BurGR. Yes, there are no reservations, so yes there will be long wait times, but i promise you it is so worth it. HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had!  Ordered the Blue Burger, which was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I've eaten at 25 Degrees, Lucky Devils, Umami Burger, The Apple Pan, The Counter, Pie n'Burger, and several other known burger joints and  am torn between 25 Degrees and BurGR for the best burger award.  We also had Shake #3, which was great as were the sweet potato fries (minus the bland dipping sauce, thumbs up for the vanilla sugar side).  My reason for 4 and not 5 stars was not because of the food, but that we some how managed to get the night with the worst service ever!  Waited a while to order after being seated, waitress was no where in sight frequently, the food took a while to hit the table, had to ask for refills, and several other minor issues that good service would have negated. Wait was 1 hour 20 mins for a party of 2 on a Sunday night around 6:45p, but did like the text paging that they over here, as do several other restaurants now days.   Overall the food was outstanding and unfortunately the service was poor."}
{"text":"Two stars is for the service.  This past memorial day vegas trip, I only needed one thing - no, that wasn't entry into clubs, free drinks, or a buffet... it was BurGR's oreo milkshake :((  I walked in the sweltering heat from Mandalay Bay to Planet Hollywood. I think it took about an hour as I tredged through the unsettling heat that is Vegas. I contemplated taking a taxi, however I figured the calories should be burnt off anyway.  Once Planet Hollywood finally came into view, my eyes widened and I was a very excited camper. Enter the hotel, and ask the security guys for directions to the beloved burger establishment. As I came near to the signature flames that encompass the brand, I realized that the one thing that I desperately wanted all year was about to be in my hands.  I walked past the line, as I only planned to order togo. I asked the hostess, \"Hi, I want to place an order for togo?\" This was 9:15pm. Her answer? \"I'm sorry, we're only doing togo orders at 10:15\".  What the fuck. My heart dropped but I couldn't really ask her why is that so, however as I write this review, maybe I should have brought it up with a manager - as I was a paying customer that risked my health in order to try to attain something four hours away from home. I couldn't exactly wait an hour, as I had to go back and get ready for XS's Night Swim.   I begrudgingly cried out a, \"thank you\", and made my way the opposite direction. It's an interesting feeling, turning your back against the thing you love.   WHAT THE FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!! Super sad panda."}
{"text":"Went for dinner recently on a trip to vegas. The wait for our party of 3 on Friday night was ~15 minutes, not bad at all.  Farm Burger ordered medium - Overall good burger, moist and flavorful, duck bacon really made this burger.  Jalapeno poppers... Being from Texas I'm used to spicy food, so is everyone else in our group... That being said nobody really noticed the extra spicy popper... Leave it to a brit to foul up making something hilariously spicy. lol. Overall they still had great flavor.  Gooey Fries - This was without a doubt the best part of the meal... It's more like a delicious potato cheese casserole."}
{"text":"Me and friends went here and the experience was definitely worth it. The food was expensive(that would be obvious since its gordon ramsay), but yhe food was great. There was 5 of us and our bill came up to like over 200 dollars  ."}
{"text":"WOW . . . I mean. . . WOW  Not many places make me say WOW in a review with all caps, but Gordon Ramsay achieved that twice in Las Vegas! This was one of the two amazing meals thanks to Chef Ramsay!  Came by around 6:00pm on a Tuesday, not too busy and did not wait at all. We sat right by the flaming wall which really gave us a Gordon Ramsay Hell's Kitchen experience!   I will start off with the biggest and quite frankly the only downside to the night...our waiter. All the other waitstaff and hostesses seemed so nice, friendly, easy going . . . but ours was an absolute ass. We sit down and don't even open our menu and asks what we want to eat. Really? The rest of the night he kept coming by trying to force us out. We didn't care, we ate and relaxed, left him no tip.  ANYWAYS now for the absolute best part - THE FOOD!  We ordered a few things, I will list them from least favorite to most favorite!  Pork Belly Hot Pockets - little hot pocket like pastries filled with pork belly, bacon marmalade, and topped with tomato jam and herb aioli. The flavors were honestly great. Tender, juicy pork belly, savory sauces, but it was just so little. For $12, the price to portion ratio just gave a lack of true enjoyment! But still good none the less    Farro-Quinoa & Chicken Salad - this was surprisingly great! A HUGE salad that my mom couldn't finish, even splitting with my dad and I, it was so much food! the chicken was juicy and cooked perfectly, the vegetables were all cooked to a delicious soft texture, the lemon vinaigrette was light and fresh, and the cheese added a nice creamy sweetness!   Jalapeño Poppers - These were the. best. jalapeño poppers. I. have. ever. had. WOW!  they bring out a long tray of six poppers, each in their own sauce cup. The poppers are HUGE! no cheapness there. The batter is thin, amazingly crispy, deliciously flavored, and inside ...WOW! jalapeños were soft, fresh, and filled with creamy thick bacon cheddar sauce! Then the sauce each popper was dipped in . . . the cheddar ranch sauce . . .OMG . . . thick, savory, salty, rich, cheesy, ranchy, absolutely amazing combination !   Last but not least, the star of the night and the whole vacation - the Truffle Burger!  Let's start with the bun . .the soft, delicious, toasted, poppy-sesame seed bun . . . excellent! Then the thick, amazingly wood grilled patty, so juicy and tasty, perfectly paired with the following condiments . . . truffle tremor cheese, oh so cheesy, warm, creamy, slightly nutty, coating your mouth in cheesy goodness. Topped with foie gras creme fraiche, continually coating your mouth while mixing with the cheese for a  savory, salty, slightly gamey flavor and creamy texture. All of this topped with truffle aioli . . oh man, this was the softest, juiciest burger I have ever eaten! Adding some fresh crunch with the frisee lettuce, this is seriously one of my top three favorite hamburgers I have ever. ever. EVER. eaten.   Chef Gordon Ramsay has brought Vegas an affordable, delicious, amazing dining experience with some of the best food you will ever have the pleasure to enjoy!"}
{"text":"The BEST burgers ever. I don't wait for a table anywhere more than 5 minutes, but BurGR is the exception. It is worth the long wait, they do not take reservations so it is best to be there at 11 sharp when they open or be prepared for a 30-45 min wait if you are lucky.  My husband and I literally have flown in to Vegas just to have lunch here... yes, you read that right.... fly into Vegas just to go to a burger joint??? Trust me, get the Euro burger if you are into truffles and goat cheese.... oh and last time we tried there Creme Brûlée something shake and it was sooo gooooood! We got it before our burgers came which was probably not the smartest choice because it is so thick and heavy it should probably be the dessert.... Anyways, if you are a burger fan, you will love this place.  I say skip Gordon Ramsay Steakhouse in Paris hotel... and eat here!"}
{"text":"Did i seriously just wait two hours for a table so that i could pay $10 for a chocolate shake? i don't mind waiting for good food at a good value, but when a restaurant charges a la cart for everything it's RIDICULOUS!! small portion of french fries were $8.  and a burger was as much as $20!! so what's the moral of this story? if you take your two kids and husband for burgers, shake and fries be prepared to spend over $100 easy!!!! seriously?????? ps: and the wait staff were arrogant and condescending when we asked for some crackers for the kids who had been waiting over three hours for food!!! AND THE FOOD? DESCENT, BUT NOT WORTH THE $145. BILL!!!   NOT COOL GORDON!!!"}
{"text":"This place is to die for! We found this place cause we stayed at Plant Hollywood cause of the fire display. It's a pretty pricey place if you want a quick bite but what restaurant on the strip is? I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and Truffle fries. The burger had the perfect kick because of the jalapeños! The meat was paired perfectly with the cheese. I can't recall the name of the cheese. However, it wasn't your normal average cheese. The truffle fries was amazing, they give you two different sauces. One was a spicier ketchup and the other was a creamy thick ranch. The service here was great. Our waiter was super friendly. She engaged in a conversation and gave us full attention. Usually I have to flag the waiter down. The seating is limited so don't come during rush hours.  Overall, I would defiantly recommend this place and for sure coming back for another bite!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a huge fan of burgers, but this has got to be one of my favorites.  We arrived Sunday around 11:30 am after checking out of our hotel, and got to BurGR with no lines! We contemplated eating there the night before, but we ended up at Gordon Ramsey Pub & Grill at Caesar's instead, but that's another review.  Our server (David??) was awesome, and very knowledgeable about the food the beer pairings. We settled on the Hog Burger, the Euro Burger, Sweet Potato Fries, and an Innis and Gunn beer (apparently, Gordon Ramsey's favorite).  The burgers were large, super juicy, but didn't fall apart when you cut into it! I'm not into eating huge burgers with my hands (as it gets all over the place and my face), and was happy I could eat it with a knife and fork. The Hog Burger comes with a pork patty, and has a hearty juicy ham flavor. The Euro Burger has a good spread of truffle aioli, which never disappoints.  The sweet potato fries were really interesting as it was paired with a honey jalapeno mayo, a flavor I've never tasted before, but delicious!  We concluded that we are definitely returning. I hope we get the same server again!"}
{"text":"Amazing #BurGR :) The Creme Brule #Oreo #Milkshake is too good for words & I love #Gourmet food but I personally don't understand why anyone would substitute real bacon for #Duck #Bacon ...either way #GordonRamsey is a #Genius"}
{"text":"Definitely heard great things! Decided to check it out. To my surprise.. It wasn't as good as people had said. Fries were SUPER salty.. And not To mention the burger as well. Ordered the jalapeño poppers and surprise surprise ALL of them had seeds in them! (Only one Is suppose to have seeds according to what the server told us). They did get our drink order wrong but we were approached by the manager which was concerned about our experience. Overall, good place. But I've had better."}
{"text":"BurGR is located in Planet Hollywood at the entrance. Their burgers are reasonably priced, though I found their appetizers and sides to be just as expensive, which doesn't really make sense. We had a burger with fig jam and mushrooms, which was very good. It was perfectly seasoned and done just right, though it was a little small, in my opinion. The Maui onion rings, which came with ranch and ketchup on the side, were to die for, and the freshly shaved parmesan on top was really what made it excellent. I would go again just for the onion rings.  Additionally, the service was friendly, and the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Loved it!! The 25 minute wait for your burger is a little rough. They slow cook that juicy, perfectly seasoned burger. It was delicious and I would return. They did mess up my order but I got over it real quick by my second bite.   Thought the fries were also cooked well. Perfectly crisp and salted. Did not try any appetizers so that might be a reason to return."}
{"text":"Eh, I'm glad I can say I went there, but I won't hurry back, or recommend to any of my friends that they go.   You wait in a casual line for a table, took us about 20 minutes to get our table for two. Menu looks good, we opt for two burgers and an order of onion rings and an order of the truffle fries.   As we wait for our meal, I notice the place is showing signs of wear, but I guess that's to be expected. My favorite is where they've used a sharpie to repair the hole in the wall laminate.   The $11 fries are done well before the burgers and sit under the heat lamp for who knows how long. I prefer my fries to be fresh, or at least made within the same evening.   The burgers come out, and they are, eh...not bad, but nothing worth returning for. I could barely taste the chanterelles on the burger named for them.    Best part of the meal was the onion rings, the flavor was good, but again, they were not fresh and were stuck together from being wedged into the cone-shaped serving dish.   Grand total for the meal was $55. I feel way overpriced for the meal. I was hoping for a place that reflected the standards Ramsey appears to have on TV, but it does NOT. I've had a lot better food on the strip. I'd advise to try Guy Fieris for truffle fries, and Bobby Flay's burgers."}
{"text":"The burgers were huge and delicious! I like that they are techy savvy and send texts when your table is ready...."}
{"text":"Great burger!!! I got the Hell's kitchen burger and parmesan fries. The fries weren't cooked enough, but the burger was really good."}
{"text":"Returned to Gordan Ramsey BurGR and had the honey-pig bao buns - roasted pork belly with cucumber, radish, cilantro and honey-hoisin sauce. They were d'lish! Hubby and I tried their signature dish the Hog burger made with Mangalitsa pork, English sharp cheddar, apple butter, arugula and served on a black and white sesame studded brioche bun and a side of fries. We shared the chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake + praline cookie - Mmmm so good! BurGR is our top favorite burger place!"}

{"text":"This was my first visit to BurGR and the hype was worth the anticipation! The menu is the perfect recipe for success and the Ramsey mantra: choose your main events and make them the best. I loved my farm burger with truffle fries and an Oreo shake.  My group was hungry...a bit hungover and impatient. Our server was funny, nimble and patient ~ she took us from \"hangry\" to one of the best casual dining experiences in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Vegas ... ah Vegas. You are indeed a land of hyper sensitive seduction and debilitating travesty all wrapped up in a bedazzled jockstrap.   This is a story of conspiracy, longing, of askance glances, rushed introductions, missed opportunities, and figgy-onion jam. That damn jam.  It began in Planet Hollywood, where after a 6-hour drive from Cali, I'm exhausted, sunburned, and starving.   Then BURGR's beatific signage loomed before me at that wondrous moment. I swear I hear angels chorusing (amongst BURGR's blazing ring of hellfire decor) Why, yes, I do want a hearty, meaty, juicy meal. Why yes, I want this meal done good. Why yes, a Gordon Ramsey establishment satisfies that level of cooking skills of awesome nommy-ness that my belly needs.   But that serendipitous moment did not transcend. Nay. I was denied by the majority (broke people). And then thus ushered to the nearby buffet, where I consoled myself in steamed mussels in what is called Le booby prize. Resentment brewed in my gut as well as indigestion. Why do we always succumb to this buffet tradition? Why do we fear this volatile, plate throwing, angry chef man?   But my tirade was abruptly aborted, when I went into what as known as a food stupor. This is not exactly aligned with the condition known as food coma. Food coma usually attacks as you are awake or attempting a movement like sitting. Food stupor made me forget what I was going to say and just mindlessly gnawed on a chicken bone.  Later, at 3am I was stirred out of bed with the screech of alarms and a rush of water flooding the hallway of our 32nd floor. Realizing this was not the steamed mussels talking, I got up. Someone tampered with the sprinklers. Our hallway turned into a moat in 20 minutes. That was just as long as it took to get security up there, banging on our doors to shoo us down to the lobby. So somewhere between being denied a dine-in at BURGR and a faulty sprinkler, I'm trekking my ass through a swamp of dirty carpet, and left to camp out in PH's lobby in my pajamas. Bad tan, indigestion, insomnia and all.  At 530am, I've been awake for 20 straight hours. I'm suffering through the sensations of grumbling steamed mussels, whiny drunks, and gnarly-looking divas, and as if to mock me for a lifetime of bad decisions: BURGR's signage is still looming over the lobby. Will it never end? So I was wrong to deny you! Cut me some slack! But nothing. Vegas why you wrong me so?! Can I blow $100 on some black jack and we call it a truce?   When we finally were relocated to a suite after the moat disaster, we were granted something I would've never foretold in this whole debacle:   A $150 voucher to BURGR.   Oh yeah. So I told myself, I can just sleep 3 hours and head out into the 108 degree heat. I can hang until BURGR opens and line up for 2 hours. Two hours, dude, with two kids. The wait had better be worth it.   I speak of askance glances because the man who sat us at the table was too good looking for his own good. Was he a long lost Gosling or something? Rushed intros because after waiting for 2 hours, we didn't even hear our server speaking over our drooling and gnashing of teeth. Missed opportunities because I went with the chanterelle burger and its confusing onion figgy jam.   The patty was juicy, cooked just right. But I have to admit it: the meat was barely warm edging to cold. I think the figgy-onion jam had something to do with that, because that jam was cold too in a way that it was previously chilled and turning warm after absorbing the meat's heat. The chanterelle mushrooms on top of this jam, I couldn't distinguish their flavour. It was overall sweet with some wisp of umami taste.  But the sweet flavour still had a bland taste. I really wanted some salt. None of the flavours sang to me. The angels had been silenced.   Thus, my regret. I've always been a cheeseburger girl, I dunno what I was thinking. But I put on my best happy face, as I didn't want to be That Chick at the table, pissing on everyone else's fun cuz my burger was kinda sweet and cold (sounds like something an ex would call me).  Missed opportunity, my friends. I had longed for a chance to dine at a place like this. While everyone else seemed to fall madly in love their burgers, I was silently underwhelmed. The truffle fries are good, sweet potato fries dare I say better. It would've been a perfect meal if I had just gotten the right burger for me.   I would pass on that jam next time. Get the one with the cheese and the egg, and top it off with a shake. If you can't do it for yourself, do it for me."}
{"text":"Confined to be amazed at the flavors in the burgers and its a must to order the truffles fries as a side. This is a stop each time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I was so underwhelmed when I was here.   Service was good food came fast. I don't quite like the iPad on the table but ehhh.   Truffle fries were quite blah and didn't eat but a few. The burger was also very ehhh, I had about three bites and ate the rest when I was drunk.   In my opinion there are much better places to eat while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Whoever created those Jalapeño poppers to put on the menu deserves a raise.  This place was everything I'd expect from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, and I'm glad I got to go.  I didn't particularly enjoy MY sandwich (the fish and chips) but everyone else I tasted was \"Money Baby!\"  (Please tell me you get this reference...) Anywho, I'm a fan for life... now if he'd only open one in L.A...."}
{"text":"I tried the best burger in the world here. Hands down, this is the best place for having a burger. Better than BJ's, steakhouse, applebee's etc."}
{"text":"This was my first time ever coming to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and i have to say that the food was amazing. I highly recommend the fries and the classic american burger. My friends had the shakes and had no complaints!!!  However, the service i was not impressed with at all. After waiting an hour to be seated, we were sat at a table (there were 5 individuals) that was meant for 4 people and the hostess did not act as if there was any issue with this placement. Next, we ordered shakes that came before our water and to top it all off, the waitress never told us that the fries came in such large portions so we looked pretty stupid sitting there with the fries but luckily we were able to have 2 orders of fries removed from the bill.  Overall it was an okay place."}
{"text":"The burger wasn't tasty but cooked properly. The service was slow. Took 45 minutes to get a burger and fries."}
{"text":"I stopped in last week with a group of 12.   I get that large parties are tricky but the service was incredibly slow and, although the prices were fairly reasonable...they're just burgers and they're a little overpriced.  I had the park burger:  really bland, way overpriced, and kind of unwieldy to eat - I had a bite of my wife's Farm Burger and it was way better, I just think the pork doesn't have much flavor.  Parmesan fries were good and the onion rings were to die for!  Overall though, not great, I won't be back."}
{"text":"HILLARY IS AMAZING!!!  I didn't want fancy ketchup and she went and got me Heinz!  Hillary goes above and beyond to make a great experience.  Keep her happy Gordon!"}
{"text":"i've had a lot of burgers in my day... but this, still, for the second time, which means I'm certain, is the best burger i've ever had!   Located in the Planet Hollywood Hotel... great service, and like most places in Vegas you can bring in our outside drinks. We had the Farmhouse and Hell's Kitchen burgers along with an order of the truffle fries. simply amazing. flavorful, juicy, the duck bacon on the farm burger is so succulent.   do yourself a favor, when you're vegas, stop by Burgr, you can thank me later."}
{"text":"I really expected more from a Gordon Ramsey restaurant.   The wait was about 20-30 mins. That didn't surprise me at all.   The decor was cute and the fire wall was quite appropriate.   So where did we go wrong?  The dry a$$ turkey burger is where we went wrong.   I was so excited about this burger because I LOVE turkey burgers and could eat them several times a week.   But the turkey burger at GR's spot was a complete let down.  It was just so dry that I couldn't enjoy it and the crispy strips they put on the burger definitely did not help.  I've heard that the chicken burger is tasty, but I can't speak on the veracity of that statement   The truffle Parmesan fries were good, but I think I would've preferred the regular fries.   I would've been better off eating at Johnny Rockets. (Insert blank stare)"}
{"text":"Ok I am going to give this a 5 star review the food was over the top! The shakes were incredible , they made to order burgers for us which was great, even the Ice Tea for this southern boy was increbile.   The sauces that pair with the onion rings fries and sweet potatoes fries are paired well. The only thing is you have 30 beer taps and only one dark beer on tap come on GR at least change that.  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Gordon really knows his burgers.  I have been here twice in the last 6 weeks.  We loved our first experience so much we had to stop again on our way through Las Vegas.  My only complaint the second time was my own fault.  For some reason I went with Med Well which I almost never do and it was more like well.  Super dry and definitely took away from the meal.  The first time I did order it medium and it was great!!!  The quality of products that Gordon uses is top of the line.  From the Parmesan just bursting with fruity flavor on top of the Truffle Fries, the interesting dipping sauces that come with every App and Fry side, to the attention to detail in the marinade of the mushrooms on the Chanterelle Burger.  The first time around I had the Farm Burger due to a suggestion by a You Tube Fav of mine Jack on The Go.  He and his crew said the Farm Burger was the best burger of all time.  Seeing this I just had to try it.  I didn't myself love the Farm Burger cuz I don't love breakfast.  It kinda tasted like breakfast on a burger.  With that being said, it tasted like the best breakfast of bacon and eggs you've ever had on one of the best burgers you've ever had.  Like I said I'm not a huge fan of Breakfast and since I already had bacon and eggs that morning it was a bit of a disappointment for me.  Not because the flavor wasn't there but, more so it's just not what I was expecting.  The bacon itself was to die for, a duck breast bacon.  The egg was a little more cooked than I would of liked since I like it to run over the burger when you bite in but the quality in the egg was there.  We also tried the Sweet Potato Fries our first time.  Dusted in Vanilla powdered sugar and coming with interesting dipping sauces they were great!  Second time around we tried the Truffle Fries, homemade ketchup and what I thought was a garlic aioli.  The mushrooms on the Chanterelle Burger were marinated in some kind of rosemary something and they were just divine!  The Jalapeno Poppers were another App tried the first time around and they were great!  I unfortunately got the one they joke you with that is stuffed with all the seeds.  Couldn't taste much after the heat in the one but, their presentation and flavor of the ranch they were dipped in was amazing!  We had amazing service both times and even got a chance to get a glimpse of one of the hot dogs on the menu at the table next to us and it looked great!  Don't let the line scare you they move through it quickly and the whole vibe of the restaurant moves quickly without creating a frantic environment for the diners.  I just love everything about this place and would recommend it to anyone.  Next time I stop through I'm going for the Euro Burger.  mmmmmm Goat Cheese!"}
{"text":"The menu looked so promising! It got us to give BurGR a try with it's dressed up burgers at pretty reasonable prices.    I can't decide if it was the service or the food that I found less impressive. The hostess was super friendly and the person helping our server was nice, but our server was off putting. He asked where we were from and when we said we were local, he responded with how the locals hadn't been good customers tonight and asked us why we would have come out to the strip if we lived here as if we'd made a mistake. Turns out, he was right.    We ordered drinks and the jalapeño poppers, a burger, a hot dog and onion rings ($90 with a 20% tip). We had to ask for water while eating the poppers and did so only after he asked if we wanted another round of booze.   He came and checked on us when we had food in our mouths and said he always does that so people can't complain. If the service and food were good, that would be a cheesy but acceptable joke; as it were, it was irony.    The poppers were decent; they were much bigger than we expected. They were served individually in shot glasses with dipping sauce at the bottom, which was probably why they were cold by the time you finished.   The Britannia burger was incredibly bland and surprisingly small; if you have a healthy appetite you will definitely want to order a side.    The hot dog was served in what looked like folded in half french toast; it was impressive to look at, but when my girlfriend tried to eat it, it revealed itself to be awkward and the taste didn't make it worth the effort.   The onion rings; how can you screw up onion rings, right? No, seriously, how did you manage to make onion rings that were so unappealing that we didn't eat them?   The server came back to ask if we wanted desert with the check already in his hand and never came back to collect it. Thankfully we had exact change. It's pretty obvious to me that the locals not treating him well was because they weren't looking through vacation goggles that make everything seem great because, you know VEGAS, BABY!   It's also obvious from his approach that they don't really expect repeat clientele, but that's ok, because even if the service had been great, the food wasn't, so there really isn't any reason for us to go back."}
{"text":"Great place to have an exceptional dinner. I started off with the Oreo shake, the pudding was outrageously fantastic. I was kinda nervous being a vegetarian inside of a GR restaurant, lucky for me I got to order the Earth Burger. Just the smell alone is worth the trip, I love how the bun was toasted just perfectly. The burger was hardy and amazing. I also had the truffle parm fries which were the best fries I've ever tasted, and I don't think they can ever be topped. Overall an amazing experience, with great scenery as well. The price is stiff but hey, when I'm winning in Vegas, I'm spreading my money at BurGR."}
{"text":"First time here, love the atmosphere. We were seated quickly, even though it was a busy lunch rush. Ordered the Hells Kitchen burger and truffle parmesan fries, wife ordered the American. Her burger was good but not as good as mine. The Hells Kitchen burger is really good! The parmesan fries were just good if not better. I couldn't stop eating those bad boys..."}
{"text":"Best burger I've had. The Hell's Kitchen burger was fantastic. Never knew that avocado and roasted red peppers would go well together in a burger. The Oreo Shake was tall and excellent."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for dinner, I have to say that the burgers are awful and too expensive . The only thing we enjoyed were the sweet potato fries and truffle fries. Save your money and go to In & Out burger. Sorry Gordon Ramsey!"}
{"text":"An hour wait for a table then an hour wait for the food to come out. Wish they told us the kitchen was backed up"}
{"text":"I've visited Gordon Ramsay Burgr in 2014, it was a great experience. However this time in 2016, it was terrible. Fries was super salty and I was told by staff it is supposed to be that way. It was so salty that my tongue was numbed. Sinces this is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, I am giving Gordon Ramsey's review. That s**t was saltier than your grandmother's sweaty panties."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday dinner because we wanted to go somewhere the kids would enjoy. My kids love watching master chef so we came here... everytime we watch the show since we visited my kids say \"Gordon should know about our soggy fries and bland burgers\""}
{"text":"So I yelped this place a few days ago because I wanted to be ready to eat some yummy burgers as soon as we rolled into Sin City. It was well worth the wait. My friends loved it and thanked me for choosing a great place. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger...mainly because of the name but also because of the ingredients it had.  The meat alone was flavorful and cooked to a medium perfection which was how I requested it. Oh my...it was juicy and full of roasted jalapeño chile flavor and the asaredo cheese was the perfect choice for this burger. I would've added bacon to it to add that extra hint of flavor but I love bacon on everything.   Only reason I dinged a start was because we weren't asked at all how our dinner was by the waitress. And when she dropped off the paid check, it felt like she was forcing herself to tell us to have a good day. Gotta have more cheerful and happy employees. It actually leaves a lasting impression on the place."}
{"text":"So disappointing! We were greeted and sat by a hostess who had no desire to be there, but the bartender (we sat at the bar) was great. He and the onion rings are the only reason I rated this as high as I did. I had the Farm Burger, which I was so excited about when it arrived...so much so that I took a picture of it. But two bites in I realized the flavor just wasn't there...plus, it was waaaay overcooked. And the buns they use are just awful. They may want to rethink that choice. I wouldn't recommend this place...too many better choices for an overpriced burger that actually have flavor."}
{"text":"Staff was pleasant, wait for food was a little long for a burger place. Price wise it's high and you have to order everything a la carte. Fries are a side order and really large so good for two people. Enjoyed the sauces."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night, we waited about an hour but it was worth it. You have to at least try this place once, its an experience. The appetizers were better than the entrees. The jalapeno poppers and the calamari were excellent. The burgers themselves were good, better than average. The drinks were good, nothing special."}
{"text":"My experience here at Gordon Ramsay exceeded my expectations!! Let me just tell you that you will not be disappointed!  This place is easy to find as it is located near the entrance of the casino at Planet Hollywood. As you wait in line, you'll be able to look at the touch-screen menu and gaze at the fiery decoration.  We ordered:  1. Euro Burger ($16): Truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomato. I actually preferred this over my own burger. This is probably my favorite one! The truffle was spot on along with the flavors of the burger. The goat cheese was a great complement to the meat and truffle. Just imagine a perfection infusion of savory flavors leaving you wanting more!! (5/5)  2. Farm Burger ($15): Duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar, and fried egg. Frankly, the only reason I chose this was because I was attracted to the idea of duck breast bacon. It wasn't that special as it just tasted like any typical bacon. However, the burger was delightful and delicious. But overall, I was eyeing my boyfriend's Euro Burger all night hehehehe. (5/5)  Service was friendly and very attentive. Will I come here again? Of course! I want to order my own Euro Burger next time and maybe run into Gordon Ramsey himself! The staff told us that he visits the location every so often. :)"}
{"text":"Our server Chris was outstanding. Wife has a dairy allergy and he was all over it. Even offered me cheese on the side for our truffle fries. (So I, \"Didn't miss out\") Onion rings were fantastic.   Made a great beer recommendation for myself and an equally impressive wine recommendation for my wife. Seemed extremely knowledgable about the entire menu.   Hell's Kitchen and Yardbird burgers were amazing.  Can't say enough for Chris and the kitchen. They were quite obviously an unbelievably well-oiled machine. Everyone knew their job and did it well. The main expediter (a gentleman with black hair) treated every person he encountered with the upmost care. You could really tell he loved and respected on his staff.   Overall an awesome experience. Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"BurGR with a name  I disagree with the masses on the high ratings here. Don't get me wrong, they do serve up a good burger but I would not go out of my way to stop here again. The Hell's Kitchen Burger itself was great tasting, cooked to order on a nicely made bun. The truffle parm fries complimented it well with aioli and what seemed like house-made ketchup.  What turned me off was the whole atmosphere of this place. Kinda like an uppity Red Robin, but I'd take RR any day. It all started with standing in line. You don't want my name and can't tell me how long it will take. You then query the line periodically and pull people in. Once inside, the space is smaller than I expected. Decor is posh, but uncomfortable. The seating seems just too low to the ground.   We dined at Holsteins the day before. Definitely a better overall experience. What we really should have done is cabbed over to In-N-Out and saved quite a few dollars..."}
{"text":"The space effectively recreates the madness and his ornate precision to details that have made GR what he is.  It's loud, it's busy, it works.  The Burger... The Blue.  One cannot see Maytag Blue Cheese and not order it.  The pinnacle of American Blue Cheese.  I was not disappointed.  A perfectly cooked M/R Burger that's seasoned just right.  The right amount of Arugula.  That beautiful Blue Cheese.  It all just tasted perfect.  Let us not forget or bypass the bun.  This was a great bun.  Black and White Sesame Seeded bun nirvana.  Onion Rings.  A nice large portion.  Freshly breaded and nicely fried.  Coffee.  Hot and fresh.  All employees were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Second time here, I ordered the Hog Burger and really enjoyed it. If you're a fan of pork items you won't regret it. Also ordered the gooey fries, would highly recommend but they are really filling so make sure you share them. Service could have been better but wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Oh baby oh baby. I always thought food in Vegas was hella expensive and there wasn't really a medium. Well. DING DING DING we have a winnerrr!  Burgers priced give or take about $15 a pop. And these burgers are goodddd. Definitely huge enough to get your bellies full and they have those unique, not so unique burgers. But they do'em right so it was delicious.  Feeling good that day? Get the truffle fries to start off for the table! A little on the pricey side but it's definitely big enough for a couple people to share. I shared with my friend. And. Holy crap I am literally drooling just thinking about them. GET. THEM.   Prime location right in the middle of the strip. Decently priced for a Vegas sit down restaurant. Taste buds were happy, wallet was happy. Will def be coming back next Vegas round."}
{"text":"Long wait. Burger was decent. Habit burger is better. Its fancy and unique though. Clean and the service was great. But FOOD FOOD FOOD is the main thing. and it is just, Decent.."}
{"text":"Great food Great chefs  Great atmosphere  I would definitely eat here again, five star burgers, and we came really late near closing the night we went and instead of being rude to our group, they gave us free desert! Loved it, awesome food"}
{"text":"Yeah, this chanterelle mushroom med-rare burger is in the top 3 burgers I've eaten in my lifetime."}
{"text":"Burgers were very dry and missing flavor. My wife had an earth burger and I had the Hells. Onion rings and truffle fries are MUST get! Really good side kick! Service was great as well! Our waiter was very helpful and knew the menu well."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a late evening snack. The beer battered Maui onion rings are not to be missed. The honey-Pig Bao buns were also quite tasty. Service was good. Make sure you ask for their cocktail menu - some unusual but tasty options on there."}
{"text":"The variety of burgers and unique ingredients were very good. I really liked the duck bacon and fried egg in the Farmhouse burger. The ingredients were fresh, the buns stood out and the burger was cooked exactly to order. I do think that the burger meat itself was very bland.   The appetizers and cocktails were exceptional. The jalapeno poppers came with an amazing sauce and the skinny screw was so refreshing."}
{"text":"Overpriced and ridiculous. The food was pretty good but it's really just an upscale fast food restaurant with Gordon Ramsay's name plastered all over it. If you want to go here for the novelty, enjoy!   I had the farm burger and truffle fries. Both were delicious! For dessert I ordered the cookies and creme brûlée pudding shake thing... Weird. But good."}
{"text":"Im giving a 5 stAr because the Burgers and onion rings were amazing.  I didn't really care for the French fries, they were not crunchy and not very hot."}
{"text":"Overrated because of the name. Waited in line for an hour and 30min to hour wait to get food after order was placed. Ordered the farm burger with bacon and egg. It was lacking flavor. Paired with the truffle fries which were good. I went because my friend wanted to but we both weren't impressed. 60.00 for 2 burgers, 1 truffle fry and a soda. Shakes look good and different."}
{"text":"Now there are great places to grab a burger on the strip but if you want a burger that is exceptional give this place a try.  My boyfriend who never likes what I like LOVED this place.   I ordered the farm burger-- with duck bacon, grilled onions,  cheese and a fried egg (cholesterol watchers beware).  The burger was perfectly cooked,  brilliantly presented and  properly portioned.  Just heaven in my mouth.  Also try the kale caesar salad with thin green apple slices and fresh mint.  It was a party for my palette.  Don't waste your calories or your money on the mixed drinks (unless you bring your own mini shots to supplement their watered down offerings). Also try the orange infused hot wings which my boyfriend still can't stop raving about.  After visiting this place you, like me, will be convinced that Gordon Ramsey has impeccably high standards and is a beast for maintaining consistency in every dish that leaves the kitchen.  Nuff said."}
{"text":"OMG I wanted to love this place but maybe the Blue Burger wasn't for me. The blue cheese was very sharp and salty along with the overpowering Parmesan trufle fries.. I felt  Ike I was eating all salt! Maybe I'll try the classic cheeseburger and plain fries next time. Service was great though."}
{"text":"Ok.... It wasn't bad... But my expectations were so high, so the disappointment was double! Greasy onion rings, long waiting to be seated and 30 minutes for a small burger.... Not what I was waiting for"}
{"text":"When there is a line of 50+ you know it has to be good, especially since Gordon Ramsey put his name on it!  I had the Brittania Burger and my friend had the Euro burger.  SO GOOD! Vegas is a dump, but this restaurant rocked.  We were in town for WPPI and didn't want to venture far from the MGM.  Good choice."}
{"text":"I ordered the hummus which was delicious.  I also ordered the hell's kitchen burger, medium well.  Well let's just say that my burger was a rare as when it went on the grill.  So I sent it back to be remade and was assured by the manager that the burger would come out medium well and that they would cut into the burger (not a good move but I was okay with it) to make sure it was done correctly.  But once again it was returned to me raw.  I wasn't chancing it a third time.  It was obvious that the cook couldn't make a burger something so basic at a burger joint. Gordon Ramsay should be ashamed of the incompetence of his kitchen.  On the other hand my child had the fish sandwich which he said was amazing.  I probably wouldn't return to this restaurant as there as too many amazing burger places to eat at on the Strip."}
{"text":"The food was incredibly flavorful and delicious, but that's not why I loved this restaurant. Our server, Brandon, was the best! He was friendly, humorous, and knowledgeable. He made our experience delightful!"}
{"text":"We were there on July 4th at Planet Hollywood and the sweltering heat kept us from exploring other dining establishments outside.  We very rarely eat fries and burgers because when eating out,  I prefer to eat dishes that  would be  time consuming to make at home.  We were pleasantly surprised with what we shared: Hell's Kitchen Burger, Truffle Fries and Oreo Shake.  More than enough food to share. Burger:  I liked the roasted jalapenos.  Roasted and peeled and thick sliced...(not finely chopped from a can). Fries:  Cooked perfectly (how can you mess up fries rt?).  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the grated fresh parmesan, truffle aioli, and truffle salt didn't hurt either.  I actually still crave those fries. Oreo Shake:  Creme Brulee layer on top was a plus.  I would actually go back next time we are there."}
{"text":"This was a disaster. If Gordon was there himself he would shut the place down. We ordered two burgers and a salad. The burgers came. Very bland. I had the earth burger and honestly it was disgusting. I only ate 25 percent of its cause I was hungry. But it was disappointing. They had forgotten the salad. When they finally did bring it after 20mins after the burgers it was pretty much frozen that's how cold it was. Straight our of the freezer.  Not pleased. Our waiter kept coming to me and asking me if I was famous because I had taken a few pics with other people at the restaurant. Lol It was kinda weird. Not coming back."}
{"text":"This is the best burger. Best fries. Best everything. I was prepared for a good burger but it exceeded all expectations. I have had a lot of burgers in my lifetime and these guys mastered it."}
{"text":"Our 2nd time because we couldn't get enough! Jalapeño poppers were excellent appetizer. Truffle fries are a must and burgers are bursting with flavor! We would come again!"}
{"text":"Happy Easter to me!  After 40 days of no meat, I got to break the fast in style.  Francisco A., Kevin Y., Mrs. Y., and I showed up here about ten minutes before the place opened at 11:00am and there was a line that had formed already, but this is a large restaurant so we were seated by 11:10am.  There are flat screens everywhere for sports fans, but we had to ask a few times to have the channel changed to the NCAA game on some of the screens facing us; the guys were getting antsy when they couldn't see the action.  Our waitress was very attentive and helpful with the menu since it was the first time there for all of us.  Between the four of us, we had a nice sample of the menu:  Honey Pig Bao (2 orders -4 bao total) Maui Onion Rings Sweet Potato Fries Chanterelle Burger for me Bleu Burger for Kevin Standard Burger for Mrs. Y. (I don't know the official name of her burger) Farm Burger for Francisco Push-Up Pops Iced Tea x3 and water  = $120.00, approx.  Everything was delicious and we all enjoyed our food--simple as that. The best sweet potato fries I've had, with some kind of vanilla sprinkles on top.  The onion rings were delicious, as well, with a shredded cheese, maybe Parmesan? The bao were tasty and fresh. Kevin and I halved our burgers so we could try each other's--I liked his bleu cheese burger, but the cheese was a little strong for my taste.  I loved my burger, with chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, and a yummy fig paste.  Service was consistent throughout the meal.  Our glasses were constantly changed out for refills; Cisco remarked that they must wash glasses non-stop there.  I noticed that the manager was also bringing food to other tables and it must be a trademark because he showed up at our table with our dessert.  Our bill came with a survey to fill out and one of the questions asked if the manager made contact; he sure did!   After not having meat for Lent, I knew I wanted to go someplace special for the first meal back as a carnivore.  Gordon Ramsay BurGR was the perfect place to have that experience."}
{"text":"The service is awesome. If your looking for a food-gasm you came to the right place!! #sogood"}
{"text":"Hey Gordon you should check whats going in your kitchen, two years ago when you opened BURGR it was the best hamburger  juicy and yamy really   small Tiny burger  but really the best, worth every cent  Yesterday was the most bland hamburger small not juicy and bland taste Not worth the $ 16, fat burger is better than that Too bad that you turn to just another name without quality I really liked your food  I do not know what's happening at your other Restaurants,I know I've received another Michelin star in France So maybe they are better"}
{"text":"Absolutely the finest burger I have ever had!  Grilled to perfection!  A bar tender there told me that they use  brisket,  short rib, and  top sirloin to make the most flavorful burger ever.  Although it's a bit pricey for a hamburger (and what isn't in LV?), you'll enjoy their great burgers, no matter which style you choose."}
{"text":"I really expected a lot out of our recent trip to Burgr while we were visiting Las Vegas. The place looked really cool and the 30-40 minute wait wasn't bad because we could play some games at the casino while waiting. I have seen many of Gordon Ramsey's shows and agree with what he says about food and restaurants. I guess that would be the complaint I have, I went to one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants thinking that here is a man who has learned a way to maintain the quality of food and service at a restaurant while he is not there that would be served if he was there. It was not. I ordered the Hummus, just to be different, after all, everyone at our table is ordering burgers so I am bound to get to try one anyway but hummus? Who serves hummus at a burger place? this must be some good hummus, right? Not really. I could hear Mr. Ramsey in my head pleading with whoever made this hummus to taste what he is serving and SEASON IT. (and wash the green onions before serving them) I sent the hummus back but the server simply asked if I wanted something else, and they were gracious enough to take it off my bill. I thought maybe they would want to know why I sent it back but no one asked. My wife had one of the cheese burgers and kinda the same thing, SEASON IT and learn how to cook a burger right. I seriously couldn't believe she told me she ordered hers well done, I saw her with it med rare and thought to myself she finally ordered a burger the way I like it too but nope, it was just a cook that was probably back there cooking every burger to med rare and slapping them together like they were in a mcdonalds.   The fries are a different situation all together, Holy cow were those good, the Parmesan truffle topping was super good, even made up for the fact that the fries had been sitting in the cone for a while before they were dressed and served.  I give this place 2 stars because the fries were really that good, so good that even with being a major disappointment I will still give it more than one star.  No doubt Mr. Ramsey is a good cook and passionate but you can't always expect that you can have several restaurants that will maintain that kind of drive and integrity to make every single customers experience absolutely excellent. I didn't go in looking for something wrong, I went in as a person who admired your work ethic and passion for cooking. I am very disappointed with my experience and although I will no doubt try another one of your restaurants, I will definitely lower my expectations. (Also, if you are going to put hummus on the menu with burgers, it should be the best hummus anyone has ever tasted.)"}
{"text":"Hostess in front was horrible! Super rude! Waited 1.5 hrs to be seated due to fact that she gave our table away to someone else. Hostess are all peace of shit, very very rude. Was given 3 stars because the waitress was amazing. She made our experience way better. Food was good, bit pricey but worth a try."}
{"text":"Good food but the atmosphere is very loud.  Service was spectacular as well"}
{"text":"A little wait, coffee (came for lunch, didnt have AM coffee yet) was terrible, service was nonchalant and all in all, my $23 burger was not worth it. Very disappointed. Mom's crazy hot dog was ginormous and she said it was really tasty with the jalapeños and special sauce. It was definitely a try for the Foodies that we are, but will we return? Perhaps not."}
{"text":"Waited about an hour to get seated when they told us it would be 30 min-then waited 30 min to get the food. Really??? My kids were about to eat the napkins on the table, they were so hungry. The food was ok, nothing to wait so long for tho. Service was mediocre."}
{"text":"It was good...I am not dying to go back or anything.  Once we were seated it took the waiter 20 minutes to get over to our table and just take drink orders...what in the world!!  The best part of the entire visit was seeing WWE Superstar \"RVD,\" cray cray...I was screaming!"}
{"text":"Just visited Vegas this New Year and also was residing at the Planet Hollywood. After a great Experience at the Gordon Ramsay's Pub Last July at Caesar's Palace my girl friend and I decided to try this Burger Joint. The place looks great the service was good. We ordered two of the recommended burgers from the menu but what I found to be an awesome drink is the Oreo Shake with creme brulee pudding. I highly recommend that. My opinion of the Burgers is that it was too dry even though they recommended we do the medium well. I don't know if Mr Ramsay comes over to check up on the quality of the food at this joint but he should come and see if they are up to par. As famous as he for quality and presentation is was not the food I was expecting for the price you pay for a burger. The Fries was great. Would I go back and try it again maybe...."}
{"text":"This burger joint is located inside Planet Hollywood.  We lined up to put our name down, which was a small wait in addition to the 1.5 hrs we waited to be seated.  The nice thing about BurGR is that they'll take your phone number and will text you when your table is ready.  I think all restaurants should switch to this method.  We killed some time by gambling in the casino.  The restaurant is casual, but you can tell a lot of detail was put into everything.  I liked the silverware that Gordon chose with the unique knife that rests perfectly on the plates.   I ordered the farm burger, which was delicious.  The duck bacon and fried egg on the burger went well together.  My cousins and I shared truffle fries and a house hot dog.  The truffle fries come with a curry ketchup and truffle aioli.  The fries were very good, but the hot dog wasn't to my taste.  I felt as though it has a very strong vinegar taste to it.  Kind of like it went swimming in hot buffalo wing sauce.    Definitely a good place to try if you're looking for a fancy burger place on the strip."}
{"text":"This cheese burger was so great that I don't know how I will ever enjoy another. It has spoiled me. I had the euro burger. It was the perfect blend of flavors, all beautifully complimenting one another. I ordered it medium and it was perfectly pink in the middle. My husband ordered the hk burger, also very good-- just a little too spicy for me. We each had the truffle fries which were also good.   The beer selection is also top notch. They have innis and gunn!  Which I have only been able to find in Atlanta.   The wait can be long, but it is well worth the wait. I can't wait until I have a chance to try another Gordon Ramsey restaurant. His burgr is genius!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! You wouldn't think a burger was special, but these were. Went about 1pm got seated right away. Ordered the farm burger, brittiana burger, margarita, Parmesan cheese fries. Waiter was knowledgeable, great attitude and attentive. Normally I order my burger med well, watching Gordon's shows I ordered it medium and it was just right! We wanted to got to his steak house but couldn't get a reservation for it!"}
{"text":"The wait in line was definitely worth it. My boyfriend and I got to this establishment on a Saturday night around 6 and waited probably 25 minutes to be seated. The service was good, but the food is what will be making me come back. We both ordered the Hells Kitchen burger and a plate of fries to share. The burger was nothing short of phenomenal. It's definitely one of the best burgers I've had in my life. I would also recommend the skinny cocktail, which is a house favorite. Overall, I am very pleased with Burgr and will definitely spend my money there again."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Hell's Kitchen fan so I knew if I was ever close to one of the restaurants that's part of the franchise I would be eating there. We stopped in for lunch and were full for the rest of the day so that's saying something there! I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger because I felt like that made the most sense and my boyfriend had a regular burger. We almost never share fries but the waitstaff said the portions were shareable. Once we got them I realized that he was right, I would have never been able to finish an order of fries on my own. The burgers were made well and the toppings didn't overpower the meat which was nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here at least 6 times and we addicted! The specialty drinks that they have are super. The antioxidant drink is my fav. We ALWAYS get the Hot Wings and Jalapeño poppers. They are incredibly unique and probably some of the best appetizers I've ever had. The Wings are your traditional hot buffalo wings and the other half are a mild wasabi flavor. I am NOT a wasabi fan...but this is just delicious! The poppers...oh the poppers! We seriously fight over who's gonna get the last one because they are so good! The Burgr's are delicious and have a Gordon Ramsey flare to them...super yum! My mouth is watering as I write this! They also have amazing milk shakes that are big enough to share! Definitely go here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I ordered the truffle parm fries as a starter - great as the reviews suggested, along with a chocolate shake - to die for. For the main course I had the Hells Kitchen burger. It was nice and juicy and perhaps one of the best gourmet burgers I have had in a loong time - I am not too much of a red meat eater and when I do I really like to ensure that it is gourmet and this certainly was. Net net...great food, good ambiance and very attentive service."}
{"text":"Meh! Ok, a couple of things. First off, if you are gonna make people wait in line for 25 mins, don't put the line next to a wall of fire. It's Vegas Gordon, and hot enough outside. Secondly, sitting in front of the line cooks is always fun, especially for the lone traveler. But listening to the staff complaining about what people are ordering and why they were wrong for sending something back isn't entertaining, and makes the person sitting there hesitant to send their overcooked burger back. The bun was the best part of the food. Fries were ok, burger lacked flavor. My waiter was great! A little slow on the refill, but he made up for it in menu knowledge and pleasantness, even though that isn't a word. Bottem line, I enjoyed Holsteins across the street at the Cosmo better. More inventive and tasty burgers and no line."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Saturday for lunch with the BF and it was just ok. We didn't have to wait too long due to getting a high top bar seat, but the wait felt long because the 'fire wall', while cool looking, was very warm. We sat down and waited a bit before being acknowledged. We got a waitress who told us she was in training, but there wasn't anyone around training her...that's pretty odd. It was obvious that she was new because she was awkward and left our waters empty for long periods of time...not awesome. As far as the food, it was alright, but it wasn't as good as I would hope for a GR restaurant and for the price. I got the hell's kitchen burger plus duck bacon. The bacon was good, would definitely have it again, but the burger was assembled poorly making it hard to bite and making the bun fall apart....I mean, they put half an avocado in the middle of the bun, not spread out thin, and it was popping out all over the place...not awesome, also the chili peppers were slimy and also slid out of the bun leaving me with a mess. The flavor was decent, spicy, but not as flavorful as I hoped. The BF got the american burger and said it was fine, but nothing special. We also shared the pork bao buns and it was ok, but the pork belly needed to be cooked longer... it was hard to bite due to it being tough still, but the flavors were good. We finished with the sticky toffee pudding pops. Now, we had the sticky toffee pudding at GR steak, so maybe that ruined it for us cuz that was so damn good, but these were just ok. I don't get the pop thing, it made it hard to eat and I didn't like having to eat a huge chunk of the ice cream with no cake trying to get through the first layer. The flavor was fine, but ditch the pop....just serve the pudding from GR steak please! Overall, I liked this place better than Holstein's, but it still isn't a place I'd wait in line for."}
{"text":"Poppers were on point but pricey. I had the blue burger which was very boring and full of arugula, and my fiancé had the Hell's Kitchen burger. It was not spicy at all as stated in the menu so it was also another burger which lacked flavor. Our server was helpful but while clearing the table the butter knife fell on my lap and my dress gor dirty and it was just terrible for a knife to fall on anyone I would think. Don't think I'll be back"}
{"text":"I decided to try Gordon Ramsay BurGR during my last visit to Vegas on the recommendation of a friend who had liked the burgers here a lot. I went with my cousin who wanted to grab a quick bite to eat as he had some work to attend to so we asked the hostess if we could skip the line and sit at the bar. Well that's not possible. You have to get in line to get in. Period. My cousin took off but I decided to duke it out. At around noon there was a decent line that took about 20 minutes to burn. When I was up the hostess tried to stick me to the bar seeing that I was single but I insisted on a table which she grudgingly provided after fidgeting around for a couple of minutes.  Well some decisions are just bad and this one of getting a table at Gordon Ramsay BurGR falls into that category. The tables are low and the chairs are not proportional to the height of the table so you end up sitting very uncomfortably low at the table. Anyway I was helped by a server who seemed to be clueless on the menu or at-least that was my take on her after sampling the food. I decided to get a burger and asked for a recommendation. I was told that the Euro Burger ($16) would be the one with the best taste and flavor profile whereas the Hell's Kitchen and the Earth Burger were their top sellers. I am a flavor over popularity type of guy so I decide to get the Euro Burger. Then I ask for a recommendation on the shakes and I'm told that the #5 ($9) would be the way to go. I see that this has the praline cookie so I ask if this would be overly sweet. I'm told that all their shakes are sweet so if I'm not keen on sweet I should avoid the shakes. What? This was a first. I actually found a server in America that advised against ordering something off the menu (thereby reducing the check and related tip). I have no problem with sweet, in-fact I like sweet so I got a #5. Ten minutes later the food is on the table.  Let's start with the burger. The Euro Burger comes with truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula and oven roasted tomatoes. The good news was that the buns had a decent bounce and the meat was a perfect medium. The bad news was that it had absolutely no flavor. I mean it was tasteless. I wish I could at-least taste the beef but even that was missing. The arugula did not add any crunch to the burger. Texturally it was as monotonous as its taste. A little more seasoning, a generous amount of truffle oil mixed into the mayo and some olive oil on the goat cheese would have elevated this perfectly executed failed recipe. Moving on to the shake. It was like a day and night comparison with the burger. The #5 comes with chocolate hazelnut pudding on top of a coffee shake with a praline cookie sticking out on the top. I took a large sip expecting a huge sugar rush but that was not the case. It was a perfectly balanced coffee shake which was in-fact a little less sweet but terrific. The pudding was the bomb. The worst thing was the praline cookie which was worse that supermarket quality cookies. Overall the shake was very good. It was unique. It is what you would expect from a chef like Gordon Ramsay. It is what would get you to stand 20 minutes in line to get in. The burger not so much. Chomping down tasteless calories is not my style.  After completing my burger and shake I concluded that my server was clueless. Both her recommendations were wrong. I doubt that she had tasted anything off the menu so my request to anyone from this restaurant that is reading this review is to get their servers to taste their entire menu so that they don't give wrong recommendations.  Overall I was not impressed with Gordon Ramsay BurGR and feel that it barely made the A-OK grade. This is yet another place on the strip from a TV based super star chef that does not live up to its hype in my opinion. I doubt that I will return for their burgers but if there is a small line I may stick it out for another go at their shakes. One last piece of advise would be to spilt the shake between two people rather than ordering one each as it is really heavy even though it does not look too big."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  Have you ever dreamed about sending food back at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants? Here's my experience:  I decided to come to BurGR after a long day of walking along the Las Vegas strip. I previously had an amazing experience at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants in NYC. Maybe the food here will blow my mind too?  The wait wasn't too bad. It was about a 20 minute wait on line. I ordered a Euro burger ($16) cooked to medium doneness. It was a long wait. The food finally arrived after 40-45 minutes. The burger looked great on the outside. A bite showed that the burger was more than pink on the inside. I thought maybe it was just that part, so I took another bite. Lo and behold, it was raw on the inside.  I call the waiter back and tell him that's not medium. His response was, \"is it a little too raw for your liking?\" No shit. If I was the waiter, I would have exclaimed, \"that is raw.\" He had to go ask someone before he could tell me that they'd make a new burger. The only apology that I received was for the long wait for the food. No apology for the raw food, no comp either.  15-20 minutes later, a new burger arrives already cut in half. It was a perfectly cooked medium burger. The burger itself tasted good. I enjoyed the goat cheese on it. Although the food was good, I thought the burger was overpriced. The service could be greatly improved as well when the restaurant is obviously at fault."}
{"text":"Went there last night and today! Got there just before close around midnight but still sat us, we're kind, engaging and nice. My boyfriend had an end of the world beer and I had an acai lemonade cocktail. Both were great.  We had the piggies in a blanket and truffle fries- both superb! Today we went for the burgers- he had the farm burger and I had the truffle burger again both wonderful. Truffle fries with the aioli sauce are a must if you go!"}
{"text":"So after trying Guy Fieri we HAD to try out Gordon Ramsay on our last day in Vegas...  This was a really tough choice between the two! Everything was amazing! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger. This comes with avocado, cheese, jalapeno peppers. The burger was just right! To drink I got the skinny screw. It was delicious! You have to get it! They don't have their drinks on a menu. The waiter came with an ipad and pulled up their drinks for us to look at. & if I remember correctly they had 32 different beers to choose from! We also ordered the beer battered onion rings. OMG! They were some of the best onion rings I ever had. They came with a ranch dipping sauce that was so good I wanted to take some home with me!   This was a really tough one for me. Between Guy Fieri and Gordon Ramsay they both had different things that I really enjoyed. I liked my burger at Guy Fieri better and the fact that it came with a variety of fries for no extra charge. However, I loved my drink and onion rings here at Gordon Ramsay. Both very pricey but well worth it. I'll definitely be back to try more items on the menu next time I'm in vegas!"}
{"text":"Very, very good wing appetizer.  I live in Dallas, and I make it a point to drive across town, when I'm in Las Vegas, just to eat these wings.  The burgers are also fantastic, and the pudding shakes, while rich, are quite good.   Definitely worth checking out - I really enjoy this restaurant."}
{"text":"An employee at this restaurant charged my credit card twice and stole my credit card info. After he charged over $250 on my card there were fraudulent charges posted to my account from a fake paypal account. He never notified me of the duplicate charge and management was not helpful at all in resolving the issue. Do not dine here unless you want your credit card info stolen."}
{"text":"I like the \"cool\" in burger gourmets and going to a restaurant named after Gordon Ramsay and to see that flaming theme at the front entrance must be exciting, right?!  We got here around noon, and our wait time was 10 minutes, thank god.   As we got seated, this place was already loud, alive and busy. While I couldn't wait to feast on their burgers, on the big screens there were some MLB playoffs going on that caught my eye.    Our waiter came, introduced himself and used an iPad to explain the selection of beers they have. We wanted something basic to pair up with their burgers, so we went with the Blondie Ale.   What's ordered:   Hell's Kitchen Burger- Its Asadero cheese, jalapeño peppers, tomatoes, and avocado.    The meat was well done. Three things that stood out about this burger is: Juicy, Cheesy and a hint of Spiciness. This one I liked a lot because its tastier.   Chanterelle Burger- Chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, figgy onion jam and fontina cheese. Its pricey at $16. It's not as tasty between our two burgers. The figgy onion jam didn't really stood out to me in flavor but made the meats savory. The arugula was leafy and had that bitter taste.   Truffle Parmesan Fries- Fries topped with truffle parmesan and truffle salt. Its really tasty, especially the aioli with them makes it addicting. These would be good fillers than just having burgers alone.   The burgers were well done and juicy. The Sesame buns were toasted but soft. Our waiter was friendly and informative. I would definitely comeback to try out some more their other flavors. Till then, I'll be looking forward to Gordon Ramsay's steak house at the Paris."}
{"text":"Truffle Parmesan Fries: YUM! Loving the truffle mayo for the fries.   Farm Burger: The runny egg really topped off the burger. Duck bacon...WHAT? Crazy but so good!   Hell's Kitchen burger: It was okay nothing special but I do like how I ordered a medium rare patty and that is exactly what I got! Nothing overcooked, perfectly pink on the inside.    1 star off for the wait (1 hour!). Also, my party of 10 got split up into two tables that weren't even next to each other but instead on opposite sides of the restaurant. This is something Gordon Ramsay would not be happy about."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I being HUGE Gordon Ramsey fans, we absolutely couldn't wait to try this place! I ordered the Hell's Kitchen buger...hands down it was the best burger I have ever tasted! It came with roasted tomatoes, roasted jalapeños, a jalapeño pesto aoli and I couldn't remember the name of the cheese! Being that I would never get those ingredients in a buger myself, I loved it so much! Everything complimented so well with each other. I finished my whole burger along with the best raspberry iced tea. I am so glad I got the Hell's Kitchen burger! My boyfriend had the all American burger n it was just as good as mines. I love the spices for the ketchup and alternative ways they make their burgers! Beautiful and delicious. Thank you to James our waiter! He was so attentive and polite and explained everything perfectly which we appreciated! For the price n quality of burgers, this would be a go to spot whenever come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Not the \"best\" burger in my life. I thought in n out was more flavorful then this place.   Beer battered onion rings 3/5 - was okay. Nothing special really. I wouldn't get.  Parmesan fries 4/5- I would pass on this also but It was better then the onion rings  Jalapeño poppers 5/5- BOMB! Definitely get this!!! The combo of flavors was wonderful  Hell's Kitchen burger- 3/5- EH. I was disappointed by the flavor. It felt like it needed some special sauce. IMO the patty was soooo dry.  Oreo shake 6/5- DUDE. This was absolutely heavenly. Every bite was like the first bite. Must get!!!"}
{"text":"Value for cost was decent. Seats and tables were strangely low. You won't rub elbows with chefs...but coupon mavens. I had the Gordon. In my opinion, they should have switched out the burger patty for the fancy ham. Instead, they topped it. Sort of busted and jenky. No regrets."}
{"text":"Great burgers with an English twist.  Pudding shakes are amazing and a must order.  Cheaper prices for Total Rewards members, so you can apply for a card for free when you enter the casino.  But if your idea of an awesome burger is In-n-Out or Fatburger, save your money and go somewhere else, like In-n-Out or Fatburger.  These establishments are in a totally different category so it would be unfair to compare."}
{"text":"ugh. I'm a Hells Kitchen watcher and a bit of a Gordon Ramsay fan so after hearing about all of hype surrounding Burgr, I had to check it out for myself. We cam fairly early in the day for lunch and to our surprise, there was a line for the wait! A group of two must wait in line while groups larger than two are able to just leave their name and number and they will send a text message when the table is ready. To my surprise, while you're waiting in line you can also see into the restaurant and there are TONS of EMPTY TABLES! It seemed the strategy was to keep a line at all times to create a bit of a \"buzz\" even though about 1/3 of the restaurant was empty. It was super annoying. While you wait in the ridiculously pointless line, as you grow closer to the front, there's a cool touchscreen scrolling menu so that you can decide what you want to order.   I ended up getting the vegetarian earth burger which was pretty good. We split an order of their truffle french fries (I've definitely had better), and their chocolate shake (very rich but good).   Bottom line, definitely overhyped and overpriced but worth a visit, but probably not a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Sorry, I'm super late writing this review....this restaurant is awesome!  Long, long line but worth the 30 min wait.  You can't miss this place, it's right inside the doors of Planet Hollywood (the side across from the Cosmopolitan Hotel, I think).  The sign is lit up in flames which can make the wait in line a bit warm.  The decor is simple and elegant, nothing too flashy.  Our server was the best!  He knew everything about the menu right down to the house made condiments.  He was a plethora of information and seriously funny to boot.  I ordered the Britannia Burger and holy crap was it delicious...best burger I've ever had...the meat was cooked perfectly, just a little pink, the bun was almost buttery and so soft and just delicious.  I'm a cheese addict and the \"English\" sharp cheddar had to be the best tasting cheese I have ever eaten and the mango chutney went so well to balance the tang of the cheese.  I also had the chocolate hazelnut shake, oh my gosh...this was no ordinary shake, it was like a fine dessert in a cup.  Chocolate heaven!  The prices were so good for this high quality food.  The burger was about $15 and the shake was about $9.  We ordered 1 serving of fries which was plenty for 2 of us.  We also ordered the Farm Burger which was good but I only recommend for true duck lovers, the duck breast bacon was a little much for me.  I wish they would bring Burgr to San Francisco...excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Wow, amazing!! Not your fast food, cheap burger. Nice atmosphere. Delicious burgers. I tried the portobello one and it was spectacular. Our party loved it. Great service. Fries are delicious as well. We tried the truffle ones. We would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Burgr- the food was great and out waiter- Matt A. The trainer was absolutely outstanding. Great good and great service!"}
{"text":"Burger was good and the Truffle fries were great. The wait was long but the service was fast and efficient once we were seated. I would go back but it will not be right away, to many other places in Vegas to try."}
{"text":"I'm a burger girl so when it comes to burgers I Lovett taste something different and distinctive . So Gordon has a goat cheese burger that is AMAZING. Their Parmesan fries are really gd as well"}
{"text":"Over Hyped I think and I certainly check the line before I commit to eating there.  Great quality burgers.  My girlfriend has food allergies which they happily accommodated and I like my burgers with EVERYTHING which they also did !  Other than the tourist crowd...perfectly happy with the place.  I tend to like to eat off strip for quality and better prices but you get bragging rights I suppose !"}
{"text":"Euro burger is awesome and worth getting Maui Onion rings are really good and worth getting Farm burger is okay. With the egg and bacon it is a nice breakfast type burger but not the flavor we expected for dinner Truffle Parmesan Fries are good but we did not care much for the truffle aioli. It was much better with the curry ketchup"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, there was a huge line but we are Platinum at the casino so we luckily were sat right away!   We ordered the Gooey fries, Hog Burger and the Hells Kitchen Burger. Wow everything was so delicious! The Hog Burger was huge and full of flavor, if you love pork you will love this burger! I had the Hells Kitchen burger, if I wasnt totally stuffed I would have gotten another. The fries had truffle oil, cheese, salami and a fried egg, they were so filling but so good. Service was fantastic through out dinner. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This review is for a visit when my family and I went to Las Vegas to attend a wedding back in March of this year.  AS a burger fan, I always like trying new places out, especially in Sin City, where the eateries are as abundant as the slot machines and paid escorts.  Gordan Ramsay BurGR is located in side Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino.  Watching Hell's Kitchen in the past, I was always curious if Mr. Mean Chef lived up to his high expectations.  BurGR did just that.  My sister and I went here for lunch while our parents went out to the casino.  There was a line, but it didn't take us too long to be seated.  Once seated inside you notice how modern the restaurant is, coupled with simple color accents or orange and brown.  Nice touch.  The table servers were pretty cool, as the male servers were dressed in all black, while the female servers were very attractive wearing one piece short dresses.  My sister and I opted to try out the Farm Burger.  The burger features a beef patty with sharp cheddar cheese, duck breast bacon (YES, duck!) and a friend egg on a sesame seed bun.  I was skeptical at first, as I am not too big into duck, but this burger was FANTASTIC!  Full of flavor, the duck didn't taste gamey, and was juicy and cooked with quality ingredients.  No complaints here!  The side were just as phenomenal as the burger.  BOTH the onion rings and fries were cooked to a crispy, golden brown, and topped with shredded parmesan cheese.  The equalizer?  The ranch dip had cheddar cheese mixed into it!  All these great flavors played off each other, creating a fabulous food medley!  I would go back here again to try out the other burgers.  A cool touch was there was a photographer who took our picture and gave it to us - I thought it was cool!  Good thing I said something before the picture letting him know I was with my sister haha.  The only gripe I had about my visit was that a random table server accidentally spilled water on my shoulder.  No big deal, as it was just water.  If it was something else, I would've demanded to see Gordon himself!!!  Fellow Yelpers, try out this place before you blow all your money on the tables and slots!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised that Gordan Ramsay can put his name on a restaurant like this. I was so excited to finally try this place after seeing it featured on Master Chef. I am sad to say that I am greatly disappointed with the results.  One positive note about the restaurant was that  the hostess took down our name and phone number to call us when a table was available. Instead of standing in line for 30 minutes, we were able to walk around the casino.   Ambiance of the restaurant was great. The fire decor at the window was sick and gave the restaurant a lot of character.   We ordered the Chantarelle Burger, Honey-Pig Bun Bao, and Truffle Parmesan Fries. The food was good, savory, and flavorful,  but definitely not unique enough to justify the steep prices.   The BIGGEST reason why I deducted 3 stars from the overall experience was because of the customer service. I want to call out our waitress Melissa. I am shocked by her attitude when it comes to serving tables at a Gordan Ramsay restaurant. Whenever we needed her to order or ask her to get us something, she was ALWAYS standing by talking her friends. The lack of service was astounding. Not only was she talking to her friend in the kitchen unseen, but she was always standing nearby our table. I never had to sit by and wait for a waitress to finish her long conversation before asking her politely to take our order. If I wasn't in a party, I would have left her $0 tips. In fact, we thought the food runner served our table much more than Melissa. He never left our water cups unfilled and was always there when we needed something. If there was a way, we would have given all of our tips to the food runner than to our server.   I wanted to write this review to really call out what terrible service I had at BurGR. Maybe I will give it a chance again and hopefully we will not get the same server."}
{"text":"Amazing meal for the price! Ordered 3 items: 1) Hell's Kitchen Burger: asadero cheese, roasted jalapeño peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato; 2) Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings: parmigiano-reggiano, chipotle ketchup, cheddar ranch dip; and 3) fresh brewed iced tea. Servers were very attentive! I think it beats Bobby's Burger Palace."}
{"text":"Was super excited to have lunch here today. I've been a HUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay as well as Christina for as long as I could remember. He was the one who inspired me to cook and love food so this was huge for me. The servers are extremely friendly and knowledgeable and provide impeccable service.  I started off with the Beer Battered Maui Onion Rings. They were perfectly cooked, nice and crisp on the outside but a little too sweet and salty. They went overboard with the Parmigiano-reggiano. Just a little for the flavor would have been nice but with that much on it, they were too salty.  The Truffle Burger is just what the name sounds like, a beautifully cooked burger with loads of truffle coming through. It is definitely a special occasions burger. My only problem with it is that is was way to rich and after a point that was just too much for the palate. This is probably because it is loaded with the foie gras crème fraîche, the truffle aïoli and some truffle tremor cheese. (#indulgence)  I guess the combination was wrong and I should have ordered the spicy Hell's Kitchen Burger with the Onion rings or maybe a spicy side with the Truffle Burger since these were both very rich in the end a little overwhelming. I would have really liked it if the server had suggested this to me while I was ordering it, but then again, I guess that's not really his job.   Is it the best burger I ever had? Probably not. It's definitely pricey because you're paying for the brand but it's just one of those indulgent moments every Ramsay fanboy has to experience at least once.   Overall I loved the place and would definitely recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"In short words: this restaurant receives two stars from me because of the staff.   We got the hells kitchen burger and the all american burger and hand-cut fries. Hells kitchen burger was mediocre at best, the other two items were both dry (fries weren't crispy).   Wait time was above average but that doesn't bother me.   On a random note: the chairs are really low. Why? Haha  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Delicious, awesome customer service! The burgers were awesome,  desserts scrumptious ... Gordon Ramsey is a genuis!"}
{"text":"Alex is an amazing server. He made our experience the best it possibly could be. I've never had more personable service anywhere else.  Kaleb was very attentive.  I think I'm in love with the Euro burger!"}
{"text":"chef ramsay is one of my fave chefs EVER but i am pretty disappointed with the burgers here. it hurts that i have to give this place 3 stars because i respect chef ramsay as a chef and i watch all of his tv shows. i couldn't believe how DRY the burgers came out for my boyfriend and i. it was crazy because we both ordered medium rare and the patty was a bit hard. i ordererd the farm house burger and the egg complimented the burger very well i just wish the patty as well as the buns weren't so hard to bite into. my boyfriend got the hell's kitchen burger and it was pretty good but we weren't too happy with the texture of the burger. i want to go back just to give it another try but each burger came out to be $15 each.  our fave on the menu was the TRUFFLE FRIES! the aioli sauce was to die for! it was SOOO good! it went very well with the fries. usually i love ketchup but i did't touch the ketchup at all! the restaurant was decorated with a fun fire theme. they have the nicest staff and they also send you a text when your table is ready! the menus are cool looking and very inviting.   overall just pretty sad about the dry burgers. hopefully it won't be so dry for other customers."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5 but I'm a gonna round down because the wait is a little excessive, and on top of that, the service is slow.  I like their system for handling the popularity, although I'm not sure how well known it is because there always seems to be a huge line. A hostess hovering by said line is willing to take your name and info along with your cell number; the staff will then text you when your table is ready! Easy, peasy. During this time, we headed over to Earl of Sandwich to deal with some of hunger pains. A bit unfortunate for this review of BurGR because the food at Earl of Sandwich was much better!   Now, I've had similarly pricey gourmet burgers so I didn't find the cost here to be shocking. And given that this is Vegas, the portions are pretty good for the $. No complaints from me on that end. But the burger itself was really \"just\" okay. Not bad by any means but not so great that I would want to make a special trip out here. Gun to the head, I'd vote for the Farm Burger as my fav--but really, a fried egg makes everything better.   The use of iPads and technology makes the whole dining experience fun too, but I think the biggest draw of this place, for me, was the milkshakes. We shared the #5 which I believe was the hazelnut pudding and coffee shake. The top is a creamy pudding-mousse that tastes incredible as is, but also amazing when mixed with the coffee milkshake. The presentation leaves something to be desired but I guarantee you it tastes so much better than it looks! I liked this fancy interpretation more than real milkshakes--so much so that I haven't even had a standard one since. The sticky toffee push pop desserts seem to be popular too, but I saw a couple at a nearby table order them and they looked seriously disappointing. I felt bad for them. Stick to the milkshakes (although they will come out with the meal rather than at the end, since apparently in 'Murica we don't consider milkshakes dessert).  So yeah, unless you're staying at Planet Hollywood or somewhere nearby, I'd probably skip out on BurGR. Or if you're eating somewhere else nearby (I recommend Earl's), then at least visit here for just desserts."}
{"text":"Holy shit. I've just finished the last bite of the most delicious beef burger I've ever had, and my mind still can't comprehend that such a simple combination of meat, arugula, bun, and blue cheese resulted in that much flavor.   Let's break this baby down:  Burger Patty - All beef, medium-rare. It came out slightly more medium which was great as the edges were cooked just right to bring out the flavor of the meat whereas the inside was more rich and juicy.  Buns - White bread with sesame seeds, sweet. They had to have spread butter and then grilled these. The sesame provided enough grip despite the juices squeezing out with every bite and were overall structurally sound so my burger remained intact until it was no more.  Arugula - Possibly slightly cooked or tossed with something? Also very sweet and buttery tasting. Great complement to the rest to the burger.  Blue Cheese - This version was like a spread and although it didn't evenly cover the patty all the time, it was amazingly flavorful and had a tang to it that toned down what would have been an overwhelmingly buttery meal.  The coffee was really good, too -- didn't need to use any creamer and it wasn't bitter but wasn't weak either."}
{"text":"Came here for a late dinner when we were in Vegas last week because my bf 's coworkers recommended it.  We ordered the hell's kitchen burger and the britannia burger. YUM :) the hell's kitchen burger had a nice spicy kick to it and I think it would've been even better if it were a bit spicier ;) The britannia had mango chutney in it, and although I'm someone who doesn't like \"fruit\" in a salty dish, this was delicious! Just the perfect amount of sweetness. I definitely would recommend checking this place out, the burgers are delicious and the prices aren't outrageous :) however, the wait time during prime dinner hour is probably really long. I came at 10pm on a Wednesday and the wait time was approximately 10-15min."}
{"text":"Check into the Cosmopolitan and was starving.. Of course I yelp what is near by and this gem came up. Gordon Ramsey Brugr is tucked away at the Planet Hollywood past the casino floor. We were seated right away and served by a very nice young man named Jay.. He recommended 2 cocktails. Their cocktail menu is interactive on an IPad. They offer is the food menu as a souvenir which was cool. So to the food:  Beer batter onion wrings : A -   Truffled parm fries: B-  Farm burger: A ( 2nd best burger i have have in my life. ( medium burger, duck bacon, English cheddar, fried egg...    My cocktail of choice was the whisky cherry lemonade A!   good job Yelp!"}
{"text":"I love Parmesan fries but these were plain ol steak fries just some truffle oil and parm. Not crispy like I like them and way too large of fries for this type of dish.   Onion rings...huge!  The batter was a little sweet but the onions were cooked perfectly.   The aioli burger was undercooked even though we ordered medium well. It wasn't juicy either. The flavor came from the garnishes. The burger itself has not seasoned well.   Overall, it's just an average burger joint owned by a celebrity chef. I've had much better."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place... the first time I came here the burgers, drinks, and the sides were absolutely amazing. We devoured everything within minutes and left extremely happy and satisfied. However, upon coming back, we thought the food was only okay. I guess 5 stars & 3 stars average to 4 stars.   This time around we ordered the Chanterelle burger, the farm burger, and the Gordon burger. The Gordon and Farm was kind of similar in terms of toppings, but the Gordon had pork instead of beef. The Farm burger also had an egg on top. For sides, we got the onion rings and the fries.   Upon receiving our burgers, we excitedly dug in and shared our food. The Gordon Burger was by far the best as the pork was super juicy and flavorful. On the other hand, the beef on the Chanterelle and Farm burger was only okay; it was kind of dry and not that good. The bacon on the Farm burger was kind of chewy and was okay, but the egg was good! The fries were decent, but it was the onion rings that stole the show. The onion rings were fluffy and crispy on the outside, and the onion on the inside was perfect. The onion rings disappeared so quickly, I only got one for myself :(   We came after lunch time around 3 pm so there was a super short wait (around 5 minute). The meal was decent, but it was definitely a downgrade from last time. Hopefully it'll be better and more consistent the next time around!"}
{"text":"I had the best fries ever that's why I give 5 stars. Worth the price. Vegetarian burger was also good but I ate better ones. The pork burger was little bit to dry. Overall nice place. Prices are acceptable. I didn't like the waitresses uniforms - all look like they had just one size of uniforms for everybody even if they had different shapes and sizes. Gordon Ramsay please dress your women employees better."}
{"text":"If in Vegas and you like burgers. This place will be a good idea for you to try.  Simple menu but full of great pre-made burger options.  I recommend trying the 'hells burger' Watch out from the long waiting lines during peak lunch hour. They do move fast however. They pay attention to details and service."}
{"text":"The burgers are tasty but not worth the wait. Fries portion is too much and they couldn't do a half of order for me. It was frustrating. The burger was a little cold."}
{"text":"We ordered onion rings and truffle fries for appetizer. Onion ring was a little greasy but the batter is flavorable; on the other hand, truffle fries was much better. Mu friends ordered burger coming medium. They said the meat was not dry but not that kind of watery juicy. I didn't try anyway. I ordered soba noodle. I put the dressin on the side. Honestly, I don't like that peanut dressing. It's too thick for me and just like peanut butter. Soba was overcooked. A little disappointed because i love al dente texture. However, the dish overall was not bad sinceI like its mild flavor."}
{"text":"Excellent food, burgers, fries, service, price-point.   Got in and out fairly quick, which was great Cant speak any higher for a place, especially in Vegas."}
{"text":"Siamo stati qui per cena, non avevamo prenotato e quindi abbiamo fatto mezz'ora di coda per avere un tavolo ma eravamo preparati perché avevamo letto che c'è sempre un forte afflusso di persone.  L'esterno del locale è molto appariscente, con una doppia vetrata enorme al cui interno fiammeggiano lingue di fuoco (fuoco vero che esce da degli ugelli a gas) il tutto in stile Hell's Kitchen!  Il locale all'interno  è piccolo, abbastanza semplice nell'arredamento, i tavoli non sono molti. Devo dire che le sedute sono piuttosto scomode e i tavoli troppo piccoli per i miei gusti.  Gli hamburger erano deliziosi così come anche le patate fritte servite con parmigiano e accompagnare da una salsa al tartufo deliziosa!  Prezzo nella media, potrebbero benissimo approfittarsene di più e sparare prezzi decisamente più alti."}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Maybe our expectations were too high, from watching his shows we expected a higher level from the kitchen. We had truffle fries, farm burger,  and the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  All very under seasoned and tasteless.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"First time at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and he definitely didn't disappoint. My sister and I both agreed this was probably the best burger we've had so far. It's not very big, but if you order fries too you'll definitely be full. We got the Hell's Kitchen special, which came with spicy pepper, avocado and cheese. Everything blended together very well and each bite was so soft and easy. We also ordered the truffle parmesan fries, which were delicious.   I'm docking a star for two reasons though. The first is that they actually cooked our burger wrong the first time. We asked for medium but it came out medium rare, so we requested a redo. The other was that our waiter was not very good and had an attitude. There was another female waitress that was way more attentive to us even though I don't think we were one of her tables.  This spot doesn't take reservations, so go early when it's not rush hour or on days that are slower. I'd come back for sure though to try some of the other burger selections, and highly recommend a visit if you're ever in the area!"}
{"text":"We waited for about an hour but because their advanced system we were able to hang in the casino rather than waiting in line. We had a farm burger and the hell's one. Love them!"}
{"text":"I finally made it to Burgr for lunch on my last day in Vegas and did not leave disappointed. I had trouble finding the restaurant on my first day due to the many points of entry for the Mile Mall, but the easiest way to remember is that it's right near the half-price tickets office. The main entrance with three escalator-walk-paths going up takes you to the Planet Hollywood side of the mall, so continue along the outside past two more entrances and you should see the ticket booth. Burgr is right inside that entrance, on the left.   Once you've actually found the restaurant, you will probably have to wait in line to be seated, and then it may take a while for service - I can't really fault the restaurant for being popular, and they really do a good job managing the massees. Burgr opens at 11 am daily, so the best way to avoid waiting is to come around 10:50 and have an early lunch. I only had to wait for a few minutes outside and then was seated immediately with excellent service at the bar.   I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and standard fries. There are a lot of other interesting choices on the menu, but I wanted to try something fairly typical and compare it to other burgers I've had. The fries are good, but nothing really to write home about. They come with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup, and far too many thick-cut fries for an individual to eat. A little pricey at $8, but definitely a nice complement to the burger. The burger on the other hand IS worth writing about. I savored every bite of the Hell's Kitchen burger, which was cooked perfectly at medium-well. The bun is one of the best burger buns I've ever had, and the jalapeno and avocado toppings went very nicely together.   I would come back for round two in a heartbeat, although I'll probably try Ramsay's other restaurant, Steak, next time I come to Vegas. Props to the bartenders for being energetic and helpful at 11 AM on a Friday dealing with a bunch of tourists."}
{"text":"Overall, if you're a Burger fan, this place will not disappoint.  We had multiple burgers and each was amazing.   Tip: Get the onion rings, extremely amazing.   Tip: Skip the normal fries: they are basic thick steak fries, but a little hard and very dry. No seasoning or flavor, honestly they were a HUGE letdown.  It was my server who suggested them, saying they were better than the sweet potato fries.  Well he ended up replacing the regular fries for them. They were much better, but still a little overcooked.   If you're like me, the fries are as important to the burger, so they need to improve on that, but the onion rings really were amazing.  They also have a bunch of shakes with is cool, even though not my taste.   Be prepared to wait, no reservations, and wait time was about 30-45 minutes. You unfortunately have to stand outside the restaurant, next to the smoky PH casino, so that's not pleasant, but considering I had eaten here before, I knew good food was just steps away."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday with the BF & four other friends. I love Gordon Ramsay so I was super stoked to try out this place. There was a pretty long wait for lunch. We waited about 45-50 minutes and before we got seated.   The BF got the Farm Burger ($15) & I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger ($15). We both ordered our burgers medium rare. We also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries ($11) recommended by our waitress.   The food didn't take long to come out. Probably a 10-15 minute wait. The Hell's Kitchen Burger was just .. Okay for me. It was just dry because there were no condiments what so ever. The meat was cooked okay but I was disappointed. I've definitely tried better burger places in LA :( the BF enjoyed his food but also agreed that he had better. The Truffle Parmesan Fries were good tho! Super flavorful. It came with curry ketchup & a truffle aioli.   I didn't end up finishing the burger. Only ate about half of it :( it was definitely over hyped.   Service was great though! Our waitress was super nice & super helpful.   I don't know if I'll be coming back here though. The long wait and expensive prices for mediocre burgers make me not want to come back :( sorry GR."}
{"text":"Things we liked:  I can't say enough about how great this burger was.  I ordered the Euro Burger with Truffle Aioli and goat cheese.  It came cooked perfectly at Medium. It was so good and I don't normally like burgers with beef! We also tried out the Parmesan Truffle oil fries with the Truffle Aioli.  We were not dissapointed. At first the fries just reminded us of Red Robin fries, however when paired with the Truffle Aioli it becomes fantastic.   Things we didn't like:  My wife orded a salad and it was OK. Not as good as a salad we got the next day at PF Changs. There was really loud music and I could not talk to my wife across the table.   Other than that my burger and fries were amazing!"}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here after the Spartan Race last Saturday (April 5th) Around 3PM. There was a line, which I don't understand. We checked in and had a drink at the bar. They were correct, we waited around 30 minutes than we were seated. We sat in the front of the restaurant. Drinks were on iPads which was cool. The menu was diverse and we were starving.   The jalapeño poppers were awesome! Each come in a separate glass with sauce so you can have your own. They were fried to perfection and delicious.   I ordered the Farm Burger and my other friend had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. Both were amazing! The best fries ever were the Parmesan Truffle fries!! We also had the sweet potato fries, they were ok. They were covered with powdered sugar, but the sauce was also sweet too...didn't like it as much.   Great portion sizes, not too bad a wait, hit the spot! I would come back again!"}
{"text":"So many reviews, I'll make mine easy and quick:  Price: $30 per person for fries + burger and no drinks  Burger: ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, all the food literally melted in my mouth and was gone within a few seconds. SO TENDER, MUCH MOIST, WOW  Fries: Meh, I've had better, get fries to share or get different ones  Line: TOO DAMN LONG, waited 1+ hour on a random Friday night  Atomsphere, it's inside Planet Hollywood so it's filled with young people, all the hostesses are dress in a short skirt with converses, and I believe most of the waitresses wear a skirt, and they are all quite cute ;)"}
{"text":"Came here hoping to see my husband who won't return my calls. Gordon I love you!! Please call me!! Haha ok but really, this place is great. We ate here on a Saturday afternoon so there was a 40min wait which was fine because oh yea you're in a casino, so off we went to gamble while we awaited our text message notifying us they were ready for us.  We finally got the message and off we went. We ordered jalapeño poppers and onion rings, they did NOT disappoint! The poppers were just the right amount of spicy and the onion rings were good too. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was amazing! The only hiccup I had was the sliced pepper they put on the burger. it was too spicy for me but if you like spicy and love that extra kick then you'll love it, I just removed it. I'm already awaiting the next time I visit Las Vegas!! So exciting to find out he has two other restaurants in LV I can go stalk him at."}
{"text":"I was in vegas and this popped up on Yelp and we decided to try it. Apart from the wait (we waited a half hour when the place looked half full) it was really good. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had. If there's one thing I can say negative is that it's a bit expensive (4 beers, 2 burgers, 1 fry was $100). Unfortunately, pricewise it didn't seem out of market for the strip. Anyways, I've always wanted to try one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants and this is probably the most affordable way to do it. Very, very, very good!"}
{"text":"The worst, I mean the absolute worst burger I have ever eaten. Much rather eat at jack in the box!  First of all it took over 45 mins for our food to arrive.  The first 2 fries tasted good but was way too salty n I love salt.  The burger was tasteless n had an awful after taste, I literally could not eat more than 2 fries n couple bites of the burger."}
{"text":"Farm Burger, Truffle fries and the most wonderful onion rings.  This restaurant has great food and is fun."}
{"text":"hmmm well first off my burger was $15!!! I thought for $15 i would get to meet gordon ramsay himself! But no he wasn't there.. i did like the burger, it had gourmet ingredients like duck breast bacon but i wish it came with fries. It was a little underwhelming for me. Also our wait time was an hour and a half because they don't take reservations. The ranch was amazing and free!! I honestly do not think i would come back mostly because as a local, going to the strip to eat overpriced food isn't worth it. But if you're visiting vegas it would be a cool place to stop and eat at.. I still love you tho gordon ramsay"}
{"text":"It's a tradition to be disappointed at all fancy restaurants owned by celebrity chefs. Don't be scared while trying the food here! It's too good! The wait to get in is long, but it's worth every minute. Check out my picture to know more"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, and was really disappointed. The truffle fries that yelpers say are so good were hard and chewy even after a second batch, and the Hell's Kitchen burger was just mediocre. Service wasn't that great either. Would not come back. Don't waste your money for these overpriced mediocre burgers :/"}
{"text":"Nice selection of beer on tap- Had a Perino. Decently priced.  Had the devil dawg, brittania burger, sweet potato fries, and the jalepeno poppers. Everything tasted amazing and fresh. The oreo shake with caramel pudding was to die for. The staff was very friendly and helpful at the bar. The hosts were efficient and very friendly as well. Mike was our server and we are so lucky to have had him :). Congrats BurGR, you made a fan out of us!"}
{"text":"Maybe we came on an off night, but I was not impressed with this restaurant at all.  Myself and two friends visited last Saturday night.  Wait was estimated at 45-60 minutes, ended up being about 75 minutes.  Not great, but ok for a Friday night in Vegas.  We shared fries and onion rings.  They were both good, but honestly nothing to write home about.  I had the special burger (basically cheeseburger with avocado and duck bacon).  I liked my burger, and was the happiest of the group.  My boyfriend had the American burger with the jalapenos.  He LOVES hot food, as in he literally cannot find food that he thinks is spicy enough.  He had 2 bites of his burger, and it was so hot he could no longer eat it, and was sick the entire night.  I of course thought my boyfriend was exaggerating, so I took one bite and had to spit it out, and my mouth was on fire for the remainder of the evening.  As my (10000% sober) boyfriend literally threw up in the planet Hollywood bathroom, I asked the waitress if it was normal for the burger to be so spicy that it couldn't be consumed, and could potentially make someone sick and she said 'yes.'   I would never come back here.  I honestly feel like his burger must have been an anomaly (I don't understand how anyone would order this if it was normal), but the waitress's responses really irked me.  It was clear that only a few bites were taken out of his burger, and that he was visibly ill from it.  Not only did she act as if it was normal, but she didn't offer to make him something different/ comp it/ etc.   Not impressed."}
{"text":"I was really excited to visit this place after falling in love with Gordon Ramsay on screen. The yelp reviews were great and I was even ready to wait in line if I had too!!! I got to his BurGR resturant at roughly 1145 no line and was seated promptly. The server was great, you get a dollar off every item if you are a Total Rewards member which I was ;). Menu semi limited but I ended up ordering  -Hell's Kitchen Burger -Farm Burger -Truffle Fries -Shake #4 the creme brulee one    The Hell's Kitchen burger was fresh and the Farm burger was very rich and savory but they both were very limited in flavor profile. There was nothing that really stood out, I could have just been eating a normal burger in the bay area.   The Truffle Fries were good its larger steak fries so I feel like you get less of the parmesan truffle flavoring. Dipping sauces were legit.   Shake #4 was very very thick and sweet, the kind of sweet sticky to your throat take a sip of water kind of sweet. It was good but I don't think I'll be getting it again.   All and all I don't think I will be returning but I will try out Ramsay's pub and grill as well as resturant =)"}
{"text":"From the onion rings to the burgers, the experience could not have been more pleasant! We ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, Farm Burger, Onion Rings, and Truffle-Parmesan Fries. The food is gourmet for what it is, and the wait can get pretty long, but it is well worth the wait. The onion rings and the Hell's Kitchen are highly recommended."}
{"text":"BurGR is great!  It would be very easy for this place to just coast on Gordon Ramsey's name and its location but thankfully they don't.  Everything on the menu sounds delicious and I want to come back and try more.  I tried the Gordon burger which has a pork patty, duck bacon, avocado, and other tasty things I can't remember.  You may be skeptical of a pork patty but it works and the first bite I took was heavenly.  My husband got the Hell's Kitchen burger and it was delicious.  We both agreed that the beef patty wins out over the pork patty, but both of them are so good.  Our friends also loved their burgers.  We also shared sweet potato fries and onion rings; super delish!  In addition to the food, the service was pretty good.  There are so many options in Vegas that it's really easy to not return to the same place twice but I really want to come back here again."}
{"text":"The burgers are amazing. The freshest burger meat I have ever had. The wait is a pain tho! But Hang in there because you probably are going to have one of the best burger in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Thankfully there wasn't a wait/line to eat here on a Wednesday lunchtime.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and split some onion rings with my wife.  The burger came cooked medium and the smoked jalapeno was really really spicy (the avocado helped calm it down some)  I liked the regular & black sesame seeded bun - it was a tad \"doughy\", but held together well.  The onion rings had a good flavor/size/crunch but sadly were a little too greasy (perhaps the oil wasn't up to temperature?) the spicy ketchup and ranch they come with were good.  We ordered the sticky toffee pudding \"pops\" for dessert and these weren't great.  The sponge part (the sticky toffee part) was very authentic, but the \"salted peanut\" ice cream was not good at all - it really didn't taste of anything outside of icy milk.  So I suggest they serve sticky toffee pudding the \"proper\" way with hot custard.  The bill for 2 burgers, one order of onion rings, 3 beers and the dessert came to $80 with tip which honestly left me feeling like it was a little too much (I know we are right on the Strip, but I don't think the taste of the food warranted that cost)."}
{"text":"To end my trip in Vegas, i decided to treat myself to this establishment.  I got there 20 minutes before they opened (I didn't checked for the times) and decided to play craps for a bit until it opened.  The staff were hustling and bustling trying to get the place ready.  I ended up as the third person in line and sat at the bar area.  My server was friendly, helpful, and he wasn't pushy.  He made some suggestions and I went along with it.  I had a farm burger with truffle fries and a light alcoholic pink drink.  The drink was surprising light and the burger was moist and rich.  The truffle fries however left me as disappointed.  They were overly salted but I think it was because I had one of the first servings on top with the salt but that was near the end.  I will come back but I might just skip out on the fries or ask for salt on the side next time."}
{"text":"Good flavors on the burgers, the fries we had were a little dry. We also liked the banana butterscotch shake. It was a good meal, but not the WOW I was expecting."}
{"text":"Damn I love this burger joint.   Their Farm Burger with Duck Bacon and Fried Egg was just simply amazing... The duck bacon was so crispy... and the beef patty was so juicy and flavorful... Ahh it was simply devine...  We also got to try their Truffle Fries which were devine and their Jalopeno Poppers which had a nice kick to it. Although some were cold inside.. not sure if they were suppose to be like that..?  Overall an amazing experience here! Gordon Ramsay you did not disappoint us! I applaud you! :)  Oh yea and a bonus... our waitress was so sweet and friendly! She went beyond her call of duty and we appreciated her for that! Yay! ^^"}
{"text":"Good was fantastic, service was prompt and friendly, and getting seated didn't take long. I would definitely recommend this restaurant again and again."}
{"text":"I wanted to eat here for a while now, so decided to have this with the group on Saturday night.   You have to stand in line, so they can get you a seat. I wish they had a better way of doing this cause it was so super hot staying next to the fire, also all those seats and slot machine just calling our names while in line. Eventually, when you get to the front of the line someone will ask how many in your party. We told her we were a party of 10. She let us out of line and ask for our phone number. She said she will call us when to come back since it was a big party. Once again, I don't know why they didn't do this at the beginning. Oh well! We ended up having to separate our party cause I guess it would be hard and long to get that many tables together since it looks like most table were made for only two people.   On to the food:  Beer battered maui onion rings-these were okay. I'm a fan of onion rings but it wasn't something I wanted more and more of   Truffle parmesan fries-I finally learn I'm not a big fan of truffle. Also, the fries were very very very salty. I think I would try the sweet potato or the just fries next time   Hell's Kitchen Burger-I was in love with this burger. I ended up getting no bun and making it into a salad wrap. So, I bet if I had it on a bun I would even be more in love with it. This burger had every sense going when you bite into it. You have the spicy from the roasted jalapeno peppers, the coolness with the avocado, and the sweetness with oven roasted tomato. All together just made a wonderful bite of a burger. Yummy.   Shake #2-this shake had coconut pudding, strawberry shake, and chocolate cookies. It was delish!!! Nice and creamy! Prefect. I think I had two sips and my hubby was already finish with it. It was that good.   Overall, if you're craving for a burger and shake. This is the place for you! Good stuff."}
{"text":"After having an amazing (although pricy) meal at Gordon Ramsay Steak, I had to try this place out.   My party and I were already perturbed prior to seating because this place has an awful, disorganized seating design. We stood for about 25 minutes in a line to get to the host stand to see a small sign indicating that parties of 2 can't be seated by standing in line and have to put their names on a list instead.   We definitely were not going to wait another half hour when we were already starving, so my party of 4 just decided to sit in pairs of 2 so we could just eat. Although they did seat us across from one another, this system is ridiculous and annoyed all of us greatly.   The hostesses were clueless, incompetent, and rude. They should have been walking up and down the huge line advising larger parties of their confusing system instead of a tiny, unreadable sign.   As for the food, it was good. My party all has different types of burgers with milkshakes. Is it the most spectacular thing in the world? No. But definitely not the worst. It's not something I would pay $15 for again though to say the least. The fries were nothing special either. The Oreo-creme brûlée milkshake I had though was to die for, and would probably only come back for that.   Overall the annoying seating system and mediocre food did not warrant the expensive tab. It's not a place I would ever go to again. If you want to go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, choose Gordon Ramsay's Steak."}
{"text":"Excellent hog and cod burger with fries. Blood Orange Cosmo was excelled and very cold. Great service and our waiter Michael was fantastic."}
{"text":"Not sure why people are giving this place less than 3-stars =/  Just tried this place out on NYE and it was pretty good in my mind. Although the wait was a bit irritating since we had a party of 6, but not much to blabble about.   Service was great, waitress, hostess, even the manager were all friendly.   Food in my opinion was nothing less-expected from GR.   Ordered the Euro-Burger (Rare) and the Truffle Parmesan Fries.   Both were amazing. Burger was cooked to my order. The fries were dericious, when they were still hot. The 2 sauces (Truffle Aioli & Ketchup) that came with the fries made my taste buds go insane. I especially liked the in-house kitchen ketchup, it had a sweet flavoring to it.   Overall: I would recommend this place for people visiting Vegas to at least try it out.  Will definitely come back and do another review after trying more of their menu!!"}
{"text":"Mood: Sports bar type.  Table and chairs- also long bar area to sit at. Seating: we sat at the bar on high top padded stool/chairs and could watch the food cooks and service teams in action. Service: Very good, Food prep team top notch. All plates checked for smudges or crumbs and cleaned or replaced before serving. Food: Very Good. Very -Very good.  I must admit, I complain of high priced Vegas places, but I am a BURGER FREAK.  The Hells Kitchen Burger and Farm burger were Fan-friggin-tastic! Even all of the condiments taste freshly made. This place makes me want to come back, like tomorrow. My past Favorite Burger places: Holsteins @ Cosmo and Burger Bar @ the mall between Mandalay Bay & Luxor. Right now, I'm putting Burgr as #1. Prices: 2 burgers, 1 hot dog (geez it is good),  2 iced teas, 1 coke, 1 parm, cheese fries, &  1 reg fries. = $95 bucks.   Yes, I could buy a lot of ground beef for that $$, but hey-it's Vegas.  I don't like to cook so when I want to treat myself to a burger (I don't eat them often because of fat/calories) I only go for a truly delicious one...and Burgr does it up right."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I shared a Hell's Kitchen Burger, a Farm Burger, and an order of sweet potato fries. Everything was seasoned perfectly, had the right texture, and it is obvious that they use fresh, quality ingredients.  Burgers seem to be small, but they do fill you up. Staff was very friendly, but service was super slow.  I personally didn't mind the slow service since I wasn't feeling well when we were seated.  After we placed the order, we planned to ask them to pack the food to-go when we see our server, but they took so long that I was feeling fine by the time they brought our food. I am waiting to go back to Vegas for more of their burgers. Hopefully they won't take that long next time!"}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed in my last visit. I've been here several times in the last few years, although I hate to admit that I don't recall most of them too well. Everything about this night was off: the food, the atmosphere, the seating. I don't think this last experience killed it for me. It's way too over-hyped now.   FOOD: 3 stars.  We ordered the chicken sliders, the Uber Cheese burger, the truffle fries, and the coconut pudding. (The coconut pudding was a special request from the top of a milkshake, so it's not on the menu). Everything was average this time around. I used to love the truffle fries but last night, they tasted way too salty and that was it. There was no hints of flavor, all I could taste was salt. The coconut pudding wasn't bad, just lacking flavor. But understandable since it's supposed to be a topping for a milkshake. The cheeseburger wasn't great or anything special. I think In N Out would be a better option for a cheeseburger, in all honesty. It didn't come with anything so I added lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and mushrooms. Even with all of that, the burger was just very plain and basic. The chicken sliders were probably the best thing we ordered. If I go back, I'll probably have to opt for that.   ATMOSPHERE: 2 stars.  Lots of weirdos here. If I wasn't getting creepy stares from the table of old guys across the way, I was distracted by people-watching the strangest people. It's nothing Burgr can avoid, but it makes a huge difference if you want to go somewhere nice with someone special. I felt uncomfortable the whole time. The tables were way too high and the seats were way too low. It's like they didn't want us to pick up our food and eat it, rather just place our chins on the table and just shove the food straight into our mouths. Also, I love sitting next to him and the table did not allow us to do so. It was SO freaking noisy in here that I couldn't hear 40% of the things he told me. Needless to say, I couldn't wait to get up and out of here.   In reality, this place is average. I wouldn't make a special trip back for this place. If it's convenient then sure, why not. Although I don't think this is a nice place, some people might consider it as such and that would be disappointing if they shared the same experience I had."}
{"text":"..order the hog burger and the gooey fries!!!..yum!!!...sis ordered the uber cheese burger..they have a secret menu - gordon burger..will definitely try it next time...service was slow too..."}
{"text":"So I went here with my family, 4 adults. 3 of us were unimpressed, 1 of us was in love!   Me personally, meh , not a fan. For the name, I would of expected much better, at least enjoyable. It was edible. We each had a different style burger and also ordered the fries and chicken wings. For 4 adults we paid around 170$ for 4 burgers, 3 fries, 4 sodas and 1 side of wings. I believe 2 girly alcoholic drinks were had as well.   Normally I would think ok about 200$ for an evening  for 4 people, could be worth it, but really not in this case. Over priced a whole bunch and the food was more decoration then tasteful.   Try hash house a gogo if you want a good burger, they're inexpensive and good!"}
{"text":"Definitely way better than the 3 1/2 star average. The burgers we as good as any \"high end\" burger joint. The service was attentive, if not almost too attentive (they cleared my friends plates while I was still eating, a big no-no in my book). Wasnt crazy about the sales pitch to visit the gift shop as I was walking in. I would go again if I'm in the mood for a burger while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger place in Vegas!  Been there several times and never been disappointed.  Love the farm burger, onion rings (and I hate onion rings, truffle fries, and the Oreo Crete brûlée shake.  Even his homemade ketchup is unique.  Every dish here is truly innovative. This is not your average burger joint."}
{"text":"I think the 4 star is pretty justifiable for this restaurant.   The hamburgers are great. It definitely has some twist from your regular burgers. Each burger has something special to it. My first time here, I tried the Euro burger and Farm burger. I know a lot of people love the farm burger, but for me personally it was a little too heavy. I prefer to have some vegetables in my burger as well. Euro burger for me was a better balanced burger. The second time at this place, I tried the Euro Burger and Hell Kitchen's burger. Hell Kitchen definitely has a fusion-ey taste to it. It was really good as well.   BUT IT IS THE PARMESAN FRIES THAT WERE SO SO SO GOOD. You have to try these fries. The oreo shake was really good as well if you have the stomach for extra sugar. The food overall is definitely something you should try if you like burgers.   The only downside is the long long wait. Last time I was there it was an hour and half wait so be prepared. Just don't go over when you are super hungry expecting to be seated right away because it won't happen.   In short, 4.5-5 stars for the food and 3.5 stars for the service and the long wait."}
{"text":"There was a line outside so that was a good sign that this place was good. It wasn't a lin wait either. It was a 15min wait only. Burgers are phenomenal. Service was good."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Burgr and I was unimpressed at the quality of food that was served. For the price of the food it's definitely not worth the long wait times."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! Best burger and onion rings I ever ate. It's a little on the pricey side but it's worth it. I would go again and reconnect it to others. I had the Gordon Ramsey burger with avacado and roasted jalapeños."}
{"text":"Started with the Jalapeno poppers and wow...SO yummy and crispy. (a lil spicy) They have a great selection of draft beer and will bring an iPad by your table to show drink options. Farm Burgr was finger-lickin good and the Euro Burgr was just as appealing to the hungry person. And you have to order the fries seperate, highly recommend the sweet potato fries and ask for the three different ketchups, yum!"}
{"text":"Euro burger was fantastic. I don't care what it costs. Was great. This is now my new favorite burger place in Las Vegas. No more Burger Bar."}
{"text":"A casual burger place located right at the entrance of Planet Hollywood.    Euro Burger - $16 - above average 3.5/5. Truffle Aioli, goat cheese, tomato.  The Euro Burger was good.  Bread had nice texture and the meat had a nice smoky taste.  My only gripe is the burger was kind of small.  For $16 I was hoping it'd be bigger.  The burger doesn't come w/ a side either.  Fries - average.  The serving size is quite large.  1 order probably fees 3-4 people.  PROS: -Burgers are decent.  The beef burgers a nice smoky taste to then. -Decent selection of beers on tap, 15-20 beers.  CONS: -Burgers don't come w/ fries -Burgers are kind of small.  TIPS: -Long line if you don't come early.   We finished dinner early, sometime around 6:30.  Around this time there was a huge line outside."}
{"text":"Pretty solid four stars, the place has a long wait so if you can just sneak up to the bar and eat there. Milkshake was great, fries come with ketchup and some kind of curry --which was a nice touch. The burger itself didn't disappoint, very juicy, great bun and cooked to perfection. It's a lot of food though so come very hungry or just split the burger. I'd definitely recommended this place with no problem, despite the celebrity bits."}
{"text":"How can one not love the gooey fries!!! Submerged in this cheesy goodness topped with runny egg... The Hell's Kitchen burger was sooooo good! The burger was cooked to perfection (almost like a pan seared burger!!!) I am going to try the Ramsay burger that's not on the menu next time!  Green tea gin was refreshing on any hot vegas day (hmm...isn't that like 365 days?)"}
{"text":"I ordered the soba noodle with chicken and it was meh. I guess I didn't really order the burgers so my view is different than someone who would get the burgers there. But my recommendation is that if you end up there just stick to the burgers. My husband really enjoyed his. However he thought there were better options in Vegas.  As for the truffle fries, they were bit hard to eat since there were too many corners that didn't have the starchy parts. They were expensive and very heavily seasoned with cheese.  Not worth the 40 min wait."}
{"text":"After trying this place I finally got peace within. Wanted to go to one of the Ramsay's place so badly and what's better to try it in Vegas and trying a burger.  We went here on a Saturday night and it wasn't much crowded, we got seats easily. The server was very warm and friendly and he quickly came to take the orders. The menu wasn't a big one but it had good varieties of burgers, fries and milkshakes.  During the time we were ordering we were already informed by our server that its gonna take time for the food to come at least 30 min by which were really disappointed but hanged on just because of Gordon Ramsay. Our food came after 45 min and since we were tired we slept on our table (lol). But all the time it took to get the food was truly compensated by the quality of food. The burgers were really nice though not very unique but very tasty. I feel like they make fresh buns when someone orders a burger and that's why it takes so much time to get food. The buns were very fresh, soft and airy which was the best part. For me quality of buns really matter in a burger as patty and veggies are almost same. I recommend to try this place at least once."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining here 3 times and seriously love everything. My girlfriends and I constantly reminisce about the food, particularly the jalapeno poppers and the euro burger. For an Englishman, Gordon knows his way around a burger.   I've found that there is always a bit of a wait, so be prepared! I always try to come right before the lunch or dinner rush to avoid an even longer wait. The restaurant is very open and you can see right into the kitchen. They do have a bar out front, but it is very exposed. It's a bit on the pricey side, but come on people it's Gordon Ramsay!  My favorite snacks to start are the onion rings and jalapeno poppers. The onion rings are lightly battered, crispy, and served with two delicious sauces. I'm not a fan of spicy food, but the jalapeno poppers have the best flavor! They are cheesy and rich and served in adorable little shot glasses. So good!  I've tried a few of the burgers and my favorite by far is the Euro burger. The goat cheese is incredibly flavorful and rich. The burger is always cooked to perfection and the buns aren't too heavy. I'm also a big fan of the fish and chips sandwich. It's a little awkward to eat, you're probably going to need a knife and fork, but the fish is absolutely perfect. If you need a side for your burger go with the truffle fries. I seriously wanted to bathe in the truffle aioli, I mean I almost licked the little cup. So at this point you are absolutely stuffed, but make room for a milkshake because you haven't had one like this before and you can't leave without one! I've only had milkshake #4 and it was a spiritual experience, I seriously wanted a private room to indulge! The Oreo shake is rich and delicious, but the creme brulee pudding sets it off. Yes, I said creme brulee pudding! Go, go get one, NOW!   In my opinion the food is more than worth the price and you deserve to indulge once in awhile :)"}
{"text":"Don't let the line deter you, they're very efficient in sending out hosts with ipads who will take your name and text you when table is ready! Props to them for incorporating technology in a great way! The burgrs are pretty damned good, but the fish sandwich was awesome. Fries and rings were great too, loved the different sauces. Great drinks - superfruit acai berrry was tops. Great, friendly and efficient service! Overall a really nice experience!!"}
{"text":"Everyone must try the MILKSHAKES =D OMG!!!! It's heavenly! You can even get the mlikshakes to go hehe! I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and shared the sweet potato fries with my friend. The burger was juicy and the bun was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"If your alone, no wait at the bar! Not a good place for wine, but about 30 Draft beers. Mr Ramsey will not come out to yell at anyone so don't be disappointed. Order the Hells Kitchen Burger ! Wow!"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times first time the service was terrible so bad I left change on the table. This most recent time the service was way better for the waiter the hostess looked pissed and didn't even greet us. The fries were good but weren't cooked fully. We had the parmesan truffle fries the mayo sauce is awesome! Ordered one of there specialty drinks the spicy margarita and it came with some leaf that ruined the entire drink I couldn't stop smelling the weird leaf after i took it out. Had the farm burger and had to have it sent back as the egg was over cooked took another 20 minutes for me to get my new burger which the egg was cooked right but the burger was burnt this time. I ended up paying and leaving after taking 2 bites. Overall I most likely wouldn't go back they need Gordon to come in and give them hell"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good...  Long lines, not sure if it's worth the wait with so many other great food in the area... However, if you get the chance definitely try it... Lots of great options and gourmet burgers..."}
{"text":"Not one for long reviews. This place rocks. Onion rings were FANTASTIC. Fries were about an 8 and the burger was maybe 7 1/2 out of 10. Great service and holy crap, the desert.....Oreo Shake was the best."}
{"text":"If you do manage to get seated without starving to death in the line, get the coffee shake (Shake #5). This is a must-have shake!  If you have the TR Diamond status or 7Stars, even better. You'll skip most of the line, if not all of it. Better yet, ask for your coffee shake to-go if that's all you want from there. As a matter of fact, that's the only thing worth getting there for me.  Many people suggest the Oreo Shake, but I think you'll have to love Oreo to death for this shake to be the best. After a few sips (quite delicious sips I must say), the shake became unbearable, and I regretted ordering it. The burgers and hot dogs are definitely different than typical ones, but their \"deliciousness to price ratio\" is way too low. My friend estimates it at 10% whatever that means to him but still low nonetheless.  Appetizers are quite overpriced. Food came out cold both times I went. If you like cold fries, then I am sure you will enjoy them.  Service is slow. Kitchen is backed up. Just more reasons to not want to physically dine there.  For a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, I expected a more streamlined operation. Maybe Gordon Ramsay himself should expedite his kitchen like he does in his shows.  I really wanted to be \"wowed\" by his restaurant, but I left with disappointment.  2 stars for being able to cut in line with my friend's TR card. Otherwise, the line is a good weight loss solution....The Gordon Ramsay Diet. It's GReat!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had from a restaurant ever.  Terrific onion rings. Service was great. Drinks came fast.  It is a well oiled machine that puts out perfection and I expected nothing less.   Gordon Ramsay is a god."}
{"text":"Great food I must say. However, his hosts at the front desk are ruining his image. The restaurant had many seats open but they had at least 10 people waiting for a table. Not a good look, very unorganized and unprofessional because they were also laughing and talking loud about their personal lives while hungry angry people were confused about the wait. Also, be prepared to pay $60 for two burgers and two sides."}
{"text":"Everytime I do a review I can never stop wishing for a guideline.  When you've been so many places it so hard to not compare and to completely concentrate on one place.  Here we go again...  Never would I have ever thought a place could have TOO muh customer service. Our server was nice, very talkative and probably checked in on us 4 times too many.  Yes better more than none at all but it was almost annoying.   I read the other reviews and the ipads we didn't have to deal with that and this crazy long wait everyone speaks of did not exist at midnight on a Saturday Las Vegas night.    The food:   The fries 3 people can share them with a meal.  The cheese on them was very heavy with taste.  The chicken wings were yummy, although I prefer sweet over spicy here the spicy worked better.    I had the Britannia burger and my friend had the burger with the fried egg so I was able to enjoy a taste of it.    Yes the burgers were good...very gourmet flavor with fusions of flavors for your pallett.  are there better burgers on the strip? Yes.  Quality of meat, presentation, service and decor you won't get better elsewhere.  So if you want to be trendy and full with a tasty meal this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Euro Burger was amazing!  You must get a pudding shake & truffle fries as well.  The wait was almost 2 hours! B crazy,  but that's vegas.  But there's plenty to do in the hotel to bide your time."}
{"text":"It seems half of the experience includes having to wait in a faux line because when you get to the front you see that the restaurant is half empty and the staff is standing around. I guess it's suppose to be like Hell's Kitchen.   I hope the food is good because the service was so appallingly bad we left before we had a chance to try it.   Maybe it's part of the theme... To be so pretentious that there's a fifteen min wait  before you can be seated in the empty dining room, while the staff looks down their noses at you.  I can hear GR now... \"always make people wait. That way there's always a line outside attracting more people.\""}
{"text":"On the night on March 2, 2017 around 11:00 p.m., myself and two of my friends dined at the Gordon Ramsay Burgr in Las Vegas, NV. This was not only my first time at this restaurant, but my first time to Las Vegas.   We were seated fairly quickly, and our serve came over in a timely manner. Once we looked over the menu was placed our order. We order some fries for the table and we each got our own burgers. I order a medium-well burger. I always order my steaks and burgers medium-well, so I know what this looks like. Our food came to the table, and I noticed that one side of my bun was soggy and the other side wasn't. I cut the burger open, and one side of the burger was medium and the other side was medium well.   I informed our waitress and her response was \" No this is medium well\". My response was \" No this isn't, this is medium. I always order my steaks and burgers like this so I know what it looks like\". She then got an attitude and said to me \" Well I'll see if our kitchen staff has left for the night or not\". At this point, I looked for a manager because her attitude was not called for.  I found the manager and started telling him what happened. He tracked down the waitress, looked at the burger apologized AND agreed that the burger was not cooked properly. He said, \" The kitchen staff is usually gone but I'll see if I can have them re-make it\". Now while I'm speaking to the manager, my waitress has gone to the kitchen to have the food remade and the kitchen staff is visibly upset and fussing.   I keep watching them as I can see them from my seat. I see them take the burger off of the grill, and the chef cuts it open and while he is cutting the burger open my waitress and another member of the kitchen staff are drum rolling on the counter to ensure that the burger is correct.  Now I work in food service, so i understand that at times it can be difficult and trying. I can assure you that, if I had a customer come back to me saying that their food was wrong and I started fussing and drum rolling on the counter, I'd be in trouble and possibly let go.  So the waitress starts to walk over with the food, and I told her that I didn't want it and that she could take it back. The manager is asking what's wrong now, and I told him about the drum rolling and everything. He then said to me \" Well my staff came back and stayed late for you to remake this burger when it was already correct in the first place. And if they were drum rolling on the counter it's because they had nothing else to do while they were remaking your food\". At that point I became more than upset. I have no idea why the manager would think that number one it was ok to be arguing with a customer who did nothing wrongand allowing his staff to be so rude, it was his staff's fault that they had to stay back and remake my food. Then he admitted at first that my food was under cooked, and then when I got upset he told me they made it correct the first time. And then to stand by unacceptable behavior from his staff.   At this point I asked him to remove the burger from my bill and give us the bill for what we ate. I also told him that I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone that I know, ever. I have never has such unprofessional service in my life, and this is a representation of the Gordon Ramsay brand. There is not a location for this restaurant in my home town and I'm glad."}
{"text":"Overpriced small burgers but the overall dining experience was good.  We sat at the bar and had a black and blue beer and burgers.  Bartender was very nice and the young lady sitting at the bar after her shift was fun to talk too."}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers, fabulous service and great atmosphere. I'm not a big fan of trendy food spots but the food was excellent Ramsay really hit the spot across the board. Brings new meaning to burgers. Burgers don't look huge on the plate but that half pound size catches you by surprise. We ordered the Euro burger (best burger I've ever eaten in my life), American burger (simply delicious), onion rings were filled with flavor, sauces were spectacular (even the homemade ketchup -I don't like ketchup), truffle fries were delicious too. 2 hungry people -2 burgers, fries and onion rings were way too much food!  The huge line went quickly. They said 20-25 minutes and were correct. The speed of service in the restaurant was quick - not rushed but fast. Waitress was awesome, helpful and on the ball.  Well worth the money. I love good food and am super critical as a fellow restaurant owner. Enjoyed from beginning to end."}
{"text":"This was my birthday dinner, and it was AMAZING. I got the über cheeseburger, my boyfriend got the truffle burger and they were both so delicious it was ridiculous. Though I do have to say I think the truffle burger was better.   Also, if you like sweet potato fries, they are a MUST here. They come with a powdered sugar shaker and jalapeño mayo. They will haunt your dreams forever."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. I ordered the Gordon Ramsay Burger with bacon, cheese, lettuce, and a medium cooked patty. The patty is what makes the burger so delicious. It's applewood smoked and just irresistible. The burger is juicy and perfectly seasoned. Also the Parmesan truffle fries are thick and amazing with the aioli. They have dessert, which I ordered these peanut butter push pops. They were layers of goodness. Also, the Oreo creme brûlée shake is extremely sweet and heavy. If you have a big sweet tooth get the shake. Plus the service here was amazing. When in Vegas, eat at Burgr."}
{"text":"Again, between and 2 and a 3.  2 always makes it seem like the food was awful or something, which it was not (except for the fries - they weren't good).  It's just that it wasn't particularly good, and was priced as if it were.  I was excited to try the place bc I kept walking by it and I love burgers and the Farm Burger sounded amazing.  I finally tried it and we both had the same response.  Bland burgers.  He didn't like the bun.  I did.  He preferred a different style of burger patty, while I was fine with it.  We both agreed though, that the burgers were surprisingly bland.  Like they hadn't been seasoned correctly or something.  I thought my burger looked amazing, but when you bit in it was just - eh.  I don't even understand how burger w duck bacon and egg can't taste amazing, but it didn't.  In retrospect maybe I should have salted it.  And then we of course had to order the $7 fries separately, and they were just not good.  As in neither of us (both big eaters) thought they were even worth eating.  So - you won't suffer here, but if you're from a place with good food, you might find that it doesn't live up to your expectations - particularly for the price."}
{"text":"Burgr is definitely a restaurant you want to try when your on the Vegas strip!   My GF and I went in the evening and waited a good 30 minutes before we sat at a table. The staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and give great recommendations.  I had the Euro burger with a order of onion rings.  My girl friend had the Hell's Kitchen burger and an order of regular fries.   Both meals were packed with flavor and in my opinion one of best burgers I have ever tasted!   The only draw back for me is the server seemed a little \"cookie cutter\" and didn't have much of a personality of her own.  More like she memorized what she had to say and just went through the same routine at every table.   We had a great experience and will be back next time were in Vegas."}
{"text":"Overall it was very good. The waiter was well-informed about the menu, but, there are too many waiters. My daughter spilt her drink on the table and I sopped  it up with her cloth napkin can. We asked for another cloth napkin. That waiter forgot to bring it to me. Then I asked our main waiter to bring napkins and he brought us paper napkins. The worst was my pork burger was almost raw and the waiter reminded me of a used car salesman trying to explain to me that it was medium well. I'm 53. I know the difference between raw and medium well. He didn't offer to get me another one. On the other hand, we ate at Chef Ramsay's steak last year spending over $400. We had a great dessert named  sticky rice. They had a sticky rice Push pop here. But it pales in comparison they should just sell the sticky rice dessert here as well. we also got sweet potato fries with their  jalapeno sauce with it -- it was very flavorful and we ask for an extra one plus some extra goat cheese for daughters burger. By the time we got them both, we were almost done with our lunch. Otherwise, overall it was enjoyable experience we liked the gas grill flames in the window the hostess outfits were Nice. I'd recommend The restaurant but too many chefs spoil the broth in this case too many different waiters/servers/busboys or whatever they're call that kept coming to our tables were clueless to our original order and several requests. I felt like it was our government where nobody was accountable to us. Despite all these problems, I still recommend it but Id make sure you made your waiter accountable"}
{"text":"Awful.   So...they have you wait in a line, stanchion method..because standing in a line is what we love to do in Vegas. Wait wasn't bad, we beat out the rush hour, barely. But 2 parties of 2 ahead of us and the wait was about 20 minutes, so start off at Earl of Sandwich with an appetizer.  Our waitress: David Copperfield was out of town this weekend, but she made up for that by pulling off some nice disappearing acts. Inconsistent visits. She specializes in serving up crabby patties because her appearance was quite unapproachable. To her benefit, she did step it up in the second half, theories loom as to why. Oh, and she lied to us about their duck bacon tasting similar to a piggies bacon...\"you can't taste the difference\"...rule #1 in life..don't lie to human beings about bacon.   Contrary to waitress belief, THEIR DUCK BACON DOES NOT TASTE LIKE PIG BACON.   Food  Farm Burger: Duck bacon, cheddar and an egg, sesame seed bun. No known alternative seems to exist aside from their sesame seed buns for buns. It's taste is no where to be seen down my memory lane. Forgotten. The meat was burnt, I asked for medium and it was medium burnt. The few spotty bites of which were not burnt was average. Not worth it. 1.5/5  American Burger: How do you make this simple burger bad? You burn it. 1/5  Seems like the cooks drew too much inspiration from the burning flames up in the front. When you've had a long night and wake up hungry you don't want to have to ask for take backs, so I dropped 50 something and pretended to like it like they were my in-laws or something.  Oh, the fries are wedges and not in my top 50. Reminded me of the ones I can get at my job's cafeteria. Thanks BurGR, just what I want to think about 300 miles away from home. 2/5   You need to trust me, I know burgers. For the expectations, this place came no where near them.   BurGR and I are never ever getting back together."}
{"text":"I'm back!!! I can't stay away from this place! I will not be satisfied until I sample everything on the menu! The food here is super delicious and the presentation is exquisite!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Service was less than satisfactory. Waited an hour and a half to be seated after the hostess estimated 30 minutes. Once we received our table (per a friend's reminder to the hostess), we were told that we were too inebriated to order a round of drinks--this coming after just one round at the bar within our wait time. Overall, the management was overtly condescending  and obviously unwilling to discuss the situation. Very disappointing for a restaurant with such a prominent name attached to it."}
{"text":"The jalepeno popper starter was really good, and spicy! My wife had the Hells kitchen burger and enjoyed it. I had the Hog burger with an egg added on top, this thing was massive, but very good. The burger was 1-1/2\" thick! We ordered a oreo-crembrule shake to go, it was good but a bit on the sweet side. Overall good experience,  a bit expensive, but pretty good food!"}
{"text":"The farm burger... I mean WOW. Duck bacon and a fried egg is just overkill!   We came here on a Sunday night, it was President's Day weekend so it was jam packed at 8:00 pm. We were told that the wait was 3 hours... I could feel my heart sinking. I've always wanted to dine at a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and this was probably the most reasonably priced one in Las Vegas. Anyway, we decided to mull over if would be able to wait three hours for a table at the slots. We waited about an hour before we received a text saying our table would be ready soon. YAAAAAAY, ran back over to the restaurant. So here's a first tip: don't let the hostess scare you with her time estimates!   Sat down, our server was immediately impressive and knowledgeable about everything we wanted to know about the menu. He gave us great recommendations on both beer and the food. I decided to go with the farm burgers, coz I mean duck bacon. 'Nuff said. But I did try all my tables burgers as well which were the Hog and the Blue Cheese burger. Mine was still my favorite! We also had a side of the truffle fries which were out of this freakin' world.   Anyway I definitely want to come back soon, the experience was overall just too good not to go back.   Recommendations: The Farm Burger and truffle fries with the vanilla-y beer (I forget the name but just ask for Gordon's personal favorite beer)"}
{"text":"Came here because I am a huge Masterchef fan.   Ordered the honey-pig bao buns and the jalapeño poppers as an appetizer to share. Both were really good, the honey pig buns were huge and are basically like mini banh mis with the bread you get when you order peking duck at Chinese restaurants. Excellent \"burger\" appetizer. Super yum! The jalapeño poppers came with 6 pieces, and they were big. I was already getting full after the appetizers I ordered the farm burger-- which had duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar, and a fried egg! I should've split the burger with someone because I didn't finish it. Tasted my friend's truffle parmesan fries, which were amazing as well.  Although my waitress forgot the shake I ordered, I was happy because because I wouldn't have been able to drink it because I was stuffed!  The outside of the restaurant is a cool fire display.  Everything was super delicious, just a little pricey!"}
{"text":"This place is not terrible, but it is nowhere near the price they charge. I tried the farm burger while my gf tried the gordon burger. Both were dry, and therefore lacked taste. We ordered parmesean fries which were not included with the burgers. Total bill was about 50 bucks. We left feeling this place was way overhyped and too expensive. I have tried much tastier burgers at \"the habbit\" for 1/4 the price."}
{"text":"The truffle fries are really yummy and the accompanying sauces are such a treat! We shared the Yardbird sandwich which reminds me of a traditional chicken sandwich with amped up ingredients. If you are ever at Planet Hollywood try this place out."}
{"text":"Not sure why Gordon Ramsay's ladies need to be dressed in short shorts. But the burgers were awesome. The service is good. This place is busy btw, so get in early. We got there at opening and had to stand in line still."}
{"text":"One of the better burgers I've had in a while. Ordered the Farm Burger just to try the duck bacon, and that along with the egg was amazing. Nothing like a juicy burger with bacon and a runny egg yolk! The truffle fries were great as well. Only gripe was after being seated the server took forever to come back, but I will definitely come back here my next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have become kind of a lazy yelper lately but really wanted to write about Burgr because I was really impressed. We went at 6 on a Monday, waited about 15 minutes in line and were quickly seated. My husband and I shared the Hells Kitchen burger, poppers and onion rings. We were being healthy. ;). Everything was perfectly cooked. The poppers had a hint of bacon, which I knew about but probably wouldn't be my first choice. They were not overly spicy, and again, perfectly crispy and not tok greasy. Onion rings were amazing and burger was delish. I got one really spicy jalapeño which really burned, but that's to be expected.   What really blew me away was the service. My water and beverage glass was never empty, my husband would order a beer and it would arrive two minutes later, the plates were quickly cleared, all in an unobtrusive way. I never felt rushed and we were really taken care of. Also, I think the prices were really reasonable. Great choice for a casual choice if you don't have a reservation."}
{"text":"If you're OK with a 2 hour stint between waiting, sitting down, eating and paying plus trying to lip read what your company is telling you this restaurant will work for you. I was surprised to see 5 girls at the desk busy chatting with each other while there was a line of waiting customers (no reservations were taken, or were they?).... luckily the bar ahead of us had 3 screens running so there was plenty of stuff to watch. Our waitress (Ginger) was very nice and extremely attentive - kudos for her. Food wise? We loved our jalapeno poppers, farm burger, and sticky toffee pudding plus nutella/coffee shake. Fries wise just go for \"just fries\", the parmesan on our truffle fries ended up like a hairy substance and the onion rings were kind of soggy. Bill ended up at US 75 for the two of us (just fizzy water as a drink), more than the indicated US 25 per person. Business casual attire? Forget it, we were in tees and shorts and felt like being overdressed. No doubt the wait will be much longer on Fridays and Saturdays.   Mr. Ramsay may like to assess the front desk environment, surely he won't be impressed either."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was good.  Not impressed after being so excited to come!   It's very loud, good for groups of people but the food was nothing special.  Glad we came but won't be back."}
{"text":"Ehhh. It's going to be difficult to write this post because I really like watching Gordon Ramsay's cooking shows and programs, but I have definitely had better burgers. Don't burn me at the stake for this review.  Located in Planet Hollywood at the front entrance is a small modern bar-like area where my bf and I both got in line to try out the place. A bit of a wait, but I figured it's Gordon Ramsay, everyone wants to eat here. We were seated and we had our order ready to go (there is an interactive menu while you are waiting in line which is pretty cool) and I got the Hell's Kitchen Burger and my bf got the burger with lamb. We also ordered some truffle parmesan fries to share. The wait took awhile for the burgers to come out and our waitress came by and gave us an ipad to order some drinks during our wait. I can see the technological interactive appeal of the place, but it didn't say anything about the food.   My burger came out and it tasted okay, but the most disappointing part of the meal was that the burger was lukewarm to cold. Wondering if my senses were off, I asked my bf to try a piece of it to see if it was cold, and he confirmed that the burger was pretty cold. It tasted like the burger had been sitting out for awhile or only partially cooked. He asked me if I wanted to let the waitress know, but I tried eating a few more pieces to see if it that was really how they wanted the burger made. Afterwards, I just left the burger by itself and munched on some truffle fries. The truffle fries were okay (they were hot at least) but a little bit overpowering on the truffle oil.  My bf wasn't that impressed with his burger either. He said that mine tasted better than his, but too bad that the temperature was off. We waited for the waitress to clear our table and I mentioned that my burger was pretty cold. She said that she was sorry but I could tell that there was little that she could do with the situation.   We paid our bill (a hefty $54 something) and tipped. I kept thinking in my head that I have had a better burger in a place like Red Robin. Sorry Gordon, but I'm sticking to your cooking shows. I don't think I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Really good burger. The wait wasn't too bad about 20 minutes. Good service, not pushy. Onion rings are huge! European burger was on point. I would go back if in town. The desserts looked wonderful, but no room left in my belly."}
{"text":"As an avid viewer of all food/cooking related TV shows, I was quite excited to try BurGR out.  I can't speak for the long lines that other people seem to complain about since my family and I arrived around 11:30pm (for a late-night snack) and there was no wait.  I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, which was quite good.  I asked for my meat to be cooked medium, but in retrospect, I probably should have ordered medium rare since the meat wasn't as juicy as I wanted.  We all shared an order of truffle fries and just fries.  I'd definitely recommend ordering the truffle fries.  The \"just fries\" were essentially regular steak fries served with a curry sauce that tasted like Indian masala.  It was weird.  Overall, I liked the burger but didn't think it was the BEST that I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge burger person but got dragged in regardless. The burger was delicious and the truffle Parmesan fries were even better. The prices are on par with the rest of the burger places in Vegas however if you're trying to save on some money, skip the drinks and play some slots right outside for a free one. The burgers do not come with any sides but we ordered the truffle Parm fries which were enough for 3 of us to share."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Vegas locals and since we had such an outstanding visit to Gordon Ramsay steak we decided to give Burgr a try. We went on a Monday afternoon so the wait wasn't bad at all. We were greeted promptly and drinks and appetizers came out quickly. We got the jalapeño poppers and the presentation was fun. Each popper had its own separate holder, half filled with a cheddar ranch that was filled with a sharp flavor. It accented the poppers perfectly. The poppers themselves were very tasty.              For dinner we ordered the Parmesan fries and I got the American burger and my husband got the farm burger. Both were cooked perfectly, great taste and looked beautiful. The fries were a nice break from the run of the mill fast food version. The Parmesan added a very unique taste.         Our waiter Alex, was great. Very personable and on top of his game. He knew I was a bit of a Ramsay fan because I wanted to keep the menu, so he made me a \"swag bag\" as he put it. Included were Burgr coasters, napkins, different versions of the menu and a pen.       Overall wonderful experience. It was truly a good time and another wonderful memory for my husband and I."}
{"text":"The entrance to Burgr is awesome, the flames fill a glass wall enticing you to come in.   Jalapeño poppers were an awesome starter, warning, they are spicy, not like the frozen ones at your grocery store. They each come in a small individual glass with dipping sauce.   We got a bottle of red Terra Valentine wine which paired well with our burgers. I had the Euro Burger as I'm a fan of goat cheese, which tasted excellent with the beef. All the flavors combined with the cheese, truffle aioli, arugula and tomato created an orgasmic flavor. The size is quite large for being a gourmet burger.   I would've given 5 stars except the wait staff were a bit slow for it not being so busy."}
{"text":"This restaurant should be on Gordon Ramsay's show Kitchen Nightmare. I think it would be a good premise for him to fix his own restaurant. Yelp gave this place really good reviews. When I came in for lunch on a Saturday there was a 10 person line. They told the party behind us that there will be a 40 minute wait. When we went in the place was half full. I was like maybe they didn't have enough staff. Sure enough there were many waitstaff wearing tight shirts without anything to do. They just goofed around with each other. Maybe there weren't enough cooks?..not true. There were at least 7 cooks cooking. So why did it take over an hour to get a fully cook burger when it was supposed to be medium well and truffle fries that were partially cooked? If I returned the food it probably would have taken another hour. Best burgers/fries in LV..don't think so.."}
{"text":"Hated it. The atmosphere was really cool but the service was kinda slow. The fries were expensive and soggy. The Damnation burger (supposed to be really spicy) tasted like old grease and didnt have a bit of spice to it at all. My husband had the Farm Burger and the egg was raw and the duck was soggy. Not my favorite place in Vegas for sure"}
{"text":"Tried out BurGR when we were in Vegas last summer.  Really enjoyed it.  We got the American Burger. As I expected, the burger was cooked pretty well and tasted great.  My girlfriend and I split the burger and fries as we had just eaten something a little before hand. She was so hungry when we were in line and couldn't wait, so we left and ate somewhere else then came back later.  If you've got the time to wait, its worth it. But expect a decent wait. We waited on a weeknight in the 10PM Hour for about 30-45 minutes. Was longer when we first got there. Now this is for parties of 2. Which is what most of the people in line were. Parties of 3 or more check in with the hostess station and they go on a list.   But Its a good burger and we enjoyed it. Give it a try if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Okay place with pretty good burgers. Price is rather steep though seeing how the burgers don't even come with sides of fries. When you order a burger, it's literally, just a burger! I didn't particularly enjoy their special, the Gordon Ramsay Burger, but I did rather enjoy their Truffle Burger.   I still prefer Romer's though."}
{"text":"Literally the best burger I have had in my life. I had the Farm Burger. Amazing. I also had truffle parm fries and they were stupid good too. I highly recommend this place. Compared to most Vegas restaurants, it's reasonably priced, the service was great, and the food is amazing. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Blue burger was amazing, the manager was very nice.  Just a tip though, the girls have to wear these short tight dresses, please require they wear spanks.  Just saying.  Service was great, food was great."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good reviews about this place and some of my friends kept on raving about it so we put it on a \"must-go\" list for me and my friends when we went last weekend. When we got there, they had a \"table for 2\" only line and for those with 2 or more people, you would have to write down your name and your cell phone # and they send you a text message when your table is ready. In my opinion, that is such a good idea especially in Vegas because you know you want to be hitting those machines and tables or drinking instead of waiting in such a long line.  We got our table in about an hour and our hostess was really great. She gave us time to look at our menu and also was very attentive to us the whole time we were there. They also used an ipad for their drink menu.  My fiancé and I decided to share and split burgers. We ordered The Hog Burger, the Farm Burger, a side of the Truffle Parmesan Fries and a glass of their Apple Cider Beer.    The Hog Burger is VERY heavy, so eat first before you drink. It was good with a good amount of flavor. (Mangalitsa pork, English sharp cheddar, Apple butter and Arugula)  The Farm Burger is really good. I would suggest to get that if you're a first timer. The flavors of all the ingredients are well put together. (Duck break bacon, English sharp cheddar and fried egg)  The order of the Truffle Parmesan Fries are so good but they are pretty heavy too so I would suggest having 3 people share it unless you really have a very big appetite. It has a good amount of truffle and it is VERY addicting. (Hard cut fries, Truffle parmesan, truffle salt and Truffle Aioli)  Overall, my experience was amazing. Maybe if I didn't have too much margarita before going in, the experience might have been double amazing. If you're a burger kind of person and you want excitement for your palate, this is a place to definitely go and visit."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place https://aroundtheworldinonepage.wordpress.com/2015/04/21/living-up-to-its-name/"}
{"text":"Unbelievable experience. Delicious food.  We went for lunch and I had the \"bangers and mash\". My wife had the pesto chicken sandwich. All were delicious.   Adam Z. was an amazing server and had spot on recommendations. Ray Ray creates and serves the best drinks. A must stop for anyone visiting Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Spot on. This place is the bomb. Atmosphere is hip food is amazing. Had the wings for an appetizer. Wow. Farm burger amazing. Beer menu. Wide. Thank you Gordon !"}
{"text":"My niece loves Gordon Ramsay, so out of the 3 restaurant choices we went here. Friendly greeting at the door, manager came over and took us to a seat after a very short delay - great service!! I will state this right now - best service I've had in Vegas in a very long time. We even got the wrong fries, and the waiter came over and whisked them off the table saying \"those aren't sweet potato fries\". Fresh SP fries on the table within 3 mins.  I had the Bleu BurgR - very tasty. My niece went another direction with fresh jalapenos and sundried tomatoes and she enjoyed it. Very tasty for $14.  Nice selection of beers as well, a little light on cocktails. I know nothing about wines but they have some, and I saw quite a few tables enjoying theirs.   Overall, great service, good food. Probably 4.5 stars because the burgers took a long time to come out."}
{"text":"I give the food 3.5 stars and the service 1star. One could not leave a name with the hostess. Unfortunately, it meant literally standing in a line. Our wait was 1 hour to get a table. that was fine as we anticipated the great chief's food would be worth the wait. We ordered food and a drink, then another drink. 40 minutes later we were still waiting. Upon questioning the server, I was told that their goal is to have all food delivered within 30 minutes of the order and she checked and it had only been 40 minutes since our order, but she would speed it up. I asked if was acceptable to miss one's goal and she said apparently so as the \"company is doing great\". Average food came 5 minutes later. it is not worth the money nor the wait."}
{"text":"It was OK... the burger was good but not spectacular.  The space was modern and inviting but overall it didn't match they hype.  Not a bad experience but not particularly memorable."}
{"text":"I'm going to try the most unbiased review that I can. BUT, I will be honest in that I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan. So, I guess I will just put it to, \"can he live up to his reputation?\"  And he does!  Truly BURGR is a very very interesting place to me. I had the benefit to be able to recently visit Vegas and enjoy the area. Being a Gordon Ramsay fan, having been to Gordon Ramsay Steak, I made it a mission to make it to BURGR while I was here.  From the decor, service, ambience, food and drinks the entire experience, was \"ON POINT\". Hitting on all 5 'cylinders' or stars should I say.   DECOR:: the huge BURGR sign out in the front with the flames is definitely eye-catching. You can't miss the place but the place is perfectly lit, tables are well spaced to where you don't feel crowded or invaded by the table next to you, and just the colors was contemporary with a bit of charm and class. Felt great to be there.  SERVICE:: probably one of my highlights would be the the overall service. Chef Ramsay demands perfection on all levels and really it just shows in the service. The hostess to the waiter was just exceptional. You would expect it at such an establishment but you really don't get it anywhere else. I asked my buddy who went with me almost if you think they ever have a 'crap' day but somehow still put on that smile and just friendly, charming and warm service. Kind of was borderline unreal, but maybe it's because I'm not used to it.  AMBIENCE:: everyone there has to be a Chef Ramsay fan or someone who wanted to check out what the hype is all about and if he is really as good as he is. Incredible. Everyone seems happy, busy eating the food or in anticipation of it that it was truly just a great experience. I felt comfortable, wasn't dressed up crazy as it seems like a very casual-classy place if possible.  FOOD&DRINK:: esthetically appealing as well as fully satisfying burger and drink for the pallet to remember for months to come. I will say that it is \"one of the\" best burgers I've ever had. Ive had other burgers from other places that I thought will be pretty up there as the best burger... but Gordon Ramsay Burgr is up there as being the top or one of the top. I think the bun, fries and quality of the meat was just spectacular to where it really gives the extra edge.   overall the entire experience just sky rocketed as all these categories fit well together... I wish I lived closer and could eat here more often. I will say the price could be a dollar cheaper but then at the same time, I am glad it isn't much higher knowing how good the Ramsay franchise is.  GO get a burger and enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight looking forward to an amazing burger. On a scale of one to ten I give my burger a six.  The food took forever to come out, and I mean a LONG TIME, when it did come out the fried egg on my burger was cold and the yolk was hard, the meat was salty and so so.  My wife actually left over half her patty.  The truffle fries were incredible.  The sweet potato fries were tasty but also cold.  Overall for the money a major disappointment. We waited.  45 minutes for a table and then almost an hour for our food. We will NOT visit this place again, there are too many other burger houses in town that truly serve a real good burger.  GR BURGR isn't one of them"}
{"text":"What an amazing burger experience!  We started with an appetizer - wings. Not just any wings! Wasabi-honey and fiery blue cheese....AMAZING!  Not too hot or spicy and very tasty!  Totally recommend.   The burger was one of the best we have had....ever....  Huge draft beer selection and amazing cocktails.  Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Standard 45 minute wait time for a restaurant in Vegas for a large party.  what I ordered:  -farm burger: 4/5 duck breast bacon + egg + meat + cheddar. It was delicious and filling. It was on the tinier side but due to the saltiness of the bacon, it was enough to fill me up. The meat was really good! I ordered mine medium rare, as always.  -truffle Parmesan fries: 5/5 OMG you have to try the fries. They are absolutely delicious!! I dipped it in the garlic sauce for a buttery taste  I wished I tried the shakes but I was too full (and broke) after my meal."}
{"text":"This is right inside Planet Hollywood when you first enter. You can't make a reservation, as it's first come, first serve. That means you have to wait in line with everyone else, but make sure you let the hostess know you're there and the size of your party. Smaller parties can sit at the bar and often be seated much earlier, so if you don't mind, ask for the bar.   I tried the truffle Parmesan fries and the Hell's Kitchen burger, which included asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, and roasted tomatoes. The fries were thick and crispy, and the accompanying sauces were incredibly delicious. For the burger, the meat was perfectly cooked, the peppers were actually spicy, and I liked the overall flavor. I also tried the Oreo milkshake with creme brulee pudding, which adequately satisfied my sweet tooth!  For drinks, they have about 30 beers on tap. The bartender gave me samples of a few I was interested in, and I picked the apple cider. I would come back just for the beer! I visited all 3 Gordon Ramsey restaurants during my last trip to Vegas, and I would have to say that I received the best service here. Also, if you're a Total Rewards member, everything on the menu is $1 cheaper, and make sure they credit your card."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, great service, great food! Had the Chili dog, duck burger and another burger. Highly recommend the Chili dog!"}
{"text":"Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and substituted beef for chicken...it was the best burger ever!"}
{"text":"I tried the following burgers which were grilled over apple and alder wood:   Uber Cheese Burger - $15 - Asadero cheese, fontina cheese, boursin cheese and vintage white cheddar.  The 4 different cheeses went well together and provided an incredible burst of flavors.  The gooey cheeses complemented my medium cooked burger which was incredibly juicy.  I also    enjoyed the black and white sesame seeds on my soft bun.  Overall this was an incredible dish and I would have to say this was probably one of the best burgers that I tried.  Blue Burger - $14 - Maytag blue cheese, arugula   The blue cheese in this burger was very subtle and not overpowering.  It didn't have that gooeyness from the cheese that the Uber Cheese burger did.  I wasn't so impressed with this burger, I'll stick with the Uber Cheese Burger next time.  ===================================================   Shake #4 - $9 - Creme brulee pudding, oreo shake and an oreo cookie. The creme brulee pudding was super thick and rich, and tasted just like creme brulee except the consistency was that of a pudding.  The oreo shake with blended oreo cookies and a whole oreo cookie served on top tasted great as well and had the proper amount of thickness so it could be easily sucked through the straw.  This was a wonderful treat.  It was like getting 2 desserts in 1 treat.  I didn't opt for the $11 truffle fries as I felt that is a bit too much to be paying for fries.  I was extremely content with the burger and shake that I did try with the exception of the pricing. It was truly a wonderful experience to have tried some creations from Chef Ramsay's kitchen and I look forward to trying some more at his other establishments!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Gordon Ramsay. Not impressed at all with this place.  We ordered all the most popular things: 1. Onion Rings: Too salty. 2. Truffle Fries: Decent.  3. Farm burger: Decent, nothing special. Bun was good. Prefer crispy bacon.  4. Chili Devil Dogs: Hot dog was way too salty. Bun was good.  Other points of interest: Service was good: The hostesses and waitress were really nice and accommodating. No kids menu. Wouldn't cut burger or hot dog in half for us because it would ruin the presentation(which is fair).  Would have given it 1 star if the price was exorbitant but it wasn't outrageous."}
{"text":"As much as I wanted to give this place a chance and believe it could be good .... It just isn't . Overpriced and simply not good. Proof that being famous doesn't mean you can cook. The place looks hip and cool and well designed but the food has a long was to go before it's even good. Bad service and and rushed servers. The outfits the poor women had to wear made most of them look like overinflated balloons. Made me think twice about getting a fatty burger when you See some of these servers running around that could hardly fit into the horrible outfits management deemed suitable. Everything is overpriced and honestly nothing tastes good . Sorry Gordon maybe you should start offering a burger at McDonalds at least the quality would be better."}
{"text":"Food/Price - Hell's Kitchen Burger - Asadero cheese, jalapeno peppers, and avocado. The burger was decent, however, the jalapeno peppers were too spicy for me. The bun was soft and fluffy but the beef was bland and overcooked.  - Sweet potato fries and truffle parmesan fries - The fries made up for the burger. The sweet potato fries with powdered sugar were amazing! The truffles fries were crispy but too salty with the sea salt and truffle aioli. - It's Vegas. Gordon Ramsay. Price is going to be on the higher end. It is what it is.  Service - Waitress was informative and attentive. Techy place where they use IPad's as menus. - Place was packed but the waitress still checked up on us every 5-10 minutes. I forgot our waitresses name but she was nice, friendly, and polite.  Ambiance/Location - Located at Planet Hollywood. Casual environment.  Recommendation - Place gets packed but once you put your name down, you don't have to wait in line. You can walk around,gamble, or shop and the hostess will call you once they have your table ready. - MUST TRY the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"The truffle  parmesan fries were soo delicious"}
{"text":"Not impressed with anything here. Ridiculous wait, took an unreasonable amount of time to get food , Luke warm burger that was NOTHING to write home about. It was not good at all. The whole experience was just BLAH.  Loud setting, hot as hell by the flaming wall (cool though). We almost missed our show dueled to the extended wait. Not going back."}
{"text":"Although I had an allergic reaction a few days earlier and couldn't eat solid food well. I couldn't pass trying out this place and I'm glad I didn't! Loved the Britannia Burger! The flavors just melts together. Although I did had to cut my burger up into tiny little pieces in order to eat it. Pretty sure the waitress and the people around me were giving me the WTH look, lol. Can't wait for the next time I'm in Vegas and able to eat to eat the burger the real way!"}
{"text":"Only redeeming value was quality of burger. Went to watch an NBA playoff game and they couldn't change the channel. Bummer. The Hell's Kitchen burger was legit though."}
{"text":"Had a very good BurGR at BurGR. As good as it gets from a food quality perspective. The bun, the meat, the toppings, nothing out of place. Mine was perfectly cooked and basically flawless all around. To top it off, they even serve Pepsi products, so was able to enjoy it with a Mountain Dew! A few drawbacks. It was very pricey, mine was about $16 if I recall, and that does not include fries. Service was slow and nothing special. Finally, the atmosphere was cafeteria like, could be improved considerably. Despite the drawbacks, if you like a good burger, it is worth going to BurGR."}
{"text":"was in the hard rock. met up with a friend.  looked around and saw this place. we went in. truthfully i was not expecting that much. however the server, Ashley was a doll. She was professional and sweet. i took my lemon out of my drink after squeezing it. i set it on the left side of the table with my straw wrapper. in about 20 seconds it was gone by Ashley. She was very attentive without being at all pushy. made recommendations. we had the a gordon burger and the bird burger, its usually chicken but she subbed the burger for me. we also shared a fire. it was the parmesan and truffle oil fries. first they were definitely enough for 2. second the seasoning and flavor went down to the bottom. she also got us to try the butterscotch push up cake pops. SCORE! they were delicious. i would def initially go back again."}
{"text":"Ok, I don't normally do this.   Actually I've never done this.   And by \"this\" I mean writing a review the same night I had the pleasure (or displeasure) of visiting a particular restaurant. However, I was so impressed by the food that I just had to. Being the foodie I am, it wouldn't be right if I didn't.  I don't even know why I'm so impressed. After all, I AM a fan of Ramsay. Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares, Masterchef, Masterchef Jr. - you get the picture. So I expected nothing short of the best; and his  restaurant lived up to every expectation I had set for it. Well, except for our particular waitress, as well as the time it actually took to get our food to the table. Hence the -1 star; but I could potentially give them a little slack on the time aspect with it being a busy Saturday night.   Ended up ordering shake #4 which was the most delectable creme brulee layered on top of an oreo milkshake which was frankly, amazing. Then the main course: the farm burger, that is quite possibly the best burger I've ever had. Ordered medium well, brioche sesame bun, fried egg, with duck breast bacon, and English cheddar cheese. Just beautiful.   Truffle fries arrived with a black truffle aioli sauce that must have been sent directly from heaven onto our table. Seriously, that aioli alone is what foodie dreams are made of.   All in all, I regret nothing. It was all fabulous - with an exception of the minor issues mentioned above.   Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I came into the Resturant with high anticipation and exceptional flavor. Worst service. Didn't order food until 30 minutes of wait time at the table. My friend's water cup wasn't clean at all, lip stick residue on the edges of the cup. Food and flavor over hyped while the burger was just a normal burger.  Environment is really noisy.  Only thing that wad cool was the fire sign of the Resturant."}
{"text":"Loved the food and service. One star taken away for rigidity, such as no fresh ground pepper, unwillingness to cook ahi, give a taste of something, no shoestring French fries. But it was mostly delicious and our server was great, as was the hostess who sat us."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger stop on the strip in Vegas.  I am a huge fan of the Farm House Burger, and almost always get one whenever I make a trip into Vegas. There is always a huge wait for Gordon Ramsay's BurGR joint, but if you make friends with a Diamond Level (or higher) casino player (or if you happen to be one yourself), you can skip the regular line completely -- cutting the wait time down to 1-15 minutes versus 35-75 minutes. (Sometimes it pays to gamble. Or to be friendly.)  Once you sit down, I would definitely recommend:  - Shoestring fries - Farm House Burger, medium-rare - Your choice of your favorite Milkshake (they're all amazing!)  ENJOY YOUR FOOD HEAVEN!   And if you're still having a sweet tooth afterwards, I would recommend visiting Gordon Ramsay's Pub in Caesars Palace afterwards, and grabbing *just* the Sticky Toffee Pudding with a pint of Innis & Gunn beer. (Ramsay's favorite.) You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Oh dear, dear (in Gordon Ramsay voice....)  Disappointing overall, and certainly that for the price paid.  I'm sure he's printing cash with this place with the endless supply of tourists coming through, but do yourself a favor and get a better burger somewhere else...."}
{"text":"Im a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay..When i heard about this place i knew i had to try it..Well i did and I LOVE it..from the burgers to the fries and onion rings. I loved the curry ketchup. The burgers are your high end burgers..so its not cheap but well worth it. If you are a big burger fan you have to try this place whenever you are in vegas."}
{"text":"We ordered the best sellers on their menu- Hell's Kitchen Burger, Farm Burger, and Sweet Potato Fries It took the burgers 25 min to get to our plates  The fries were great but the patties were way too dry It wasn't worth the wait at all I will never return again"}
{"text":"After we landed in Vegas and got situated in our hotel we came here for lunch, and it was only a 15 minute wait before we got seated at a table for 2. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger, which was fantastic. I also got the coffee shake with chocolate hazelnut pudding. I liked the coffee shake part but when I mixed it together with the chocolate pudding that kind of overtook it and no longer got the coffee flavor that I really wanted. It was very filling, but it was a pricey lunch for the 2 of us with tip a $60 felt steep. Our waitress was very attentive making sure that we got refills all the time, and just letting us know that our food was coming out soon. She was very polite and sweet and checked in on us."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsay definitely knows how to make a burger! Honestly one of the top five best burgers I have ever had. The flavors are balanced without being over powering. Also, the food isn't over salted the way a lot of burger places tend to be. I had the Euro burger and the truffle Parmesan fries -- crazy good! I want to try everything on the menu.  The venue itself is also very nice. The 30' fire wall is a nice touch. Definitely worth visiting if you're in the Vegas area."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and only had to wait 15 minutes in line. Nice, modern decor, and service was efficient. Our waitress was nice but ditzy. There were a few questions we asked that she didn't seem to understand. We ordered the truffle fries, Brittania burger, and Yardbird burger. Everything was perfectly cooked! But whoever made the Brittania burger didn't put enough mango chutney, and it tasted extremely dry. In fact, I couldn't taste the chutney at all, so I told the waitress, who said \"oh yeah, they only put a little bit on it \" It seemed like she's used to hearing that complaint. She brought out some extra mango chutney on the side, and after I put it on the burger it was delicious!! It's hard to believe that the burger's supposed to come with so little on there. Cocktails were absolutely delicious! Looking forward to coming back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Quite literally the best burgers we have ever had, hands down!! Gordon Ramsey really lived up to our expectations with his burger creations. We had the hog burger, Hell's Kitchen burger and the Euro burger with the truffle parm fries. The hog burger was amazing!!! Every bite was so die for and perfect. The Hell's Kitchen burger was a unique blend of avocados, the perfectly cooked beef patty to order, and the jalapeño was so yummy. The euro burger was lighter than the other 2 burgers but just as amazing. The fries are big enough to share for 3 people and the best fries I've ever had with an incredible sauce. The wait was worth and will come back again when in Vegas next time no matter what!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience... great service and great food to top it off! Was willing to accommodate and substitute beef patty for chicken since I'm not a beef eater."}
{"text":"Different from what I expected but I liked it. There is usually a line to get in, but it moves fairly quickly and is worth the wait. Service was excellent. Very attentive, the staff is always on the move, no one was standing around being useless.  Fri portions are large, so they are great for sharing. Burgers are good and there is some unique choices to select from. They may not be combinations that you would normally have on your burger, but give it a try. Portion sizes are filling so appetizers are only a good idea if you are sharing, we had a lot of left over food despite being very hungry. Expect about $25-30+ per person."}
{"text":"Saw a lot of positive reviews here on both Yelp and Trip Advisor, so my wife and I decided to see what the hype was all about. The farm house burger, cooked medium, was perfectly prepared and really delicious. The fried egg in the burger when broken thus spreading an added bit of goodness was a great touch. My wife had the UK burger, also cooked medium, was one of the best burgers she's had. The truffle fries were equally good, as well as their special ketchup blend and aioli sauce. The buffalo wings were excellent. Definitely not your typical bar fare buffalo wing. They also have a great and exceptional beer and wine list to accommodate your burger. Receptionist was friendly and waiter, Brandon, was awesome. Overall this is a great restaurant to try out when in Las Vegas and you're in the mood for a spectacular burger experience. All burgers are made with fresh ingredients and normally taken 20 minutes to prepare. Like i said, it's an experience. It is a pricy restaurant where the average burger is $16 and that is just the burger, but it's Vegas and it's a Gordon Ramsey restaurant."}
{"text":"The great Gordon Ramsay takes in an American institution with BurGR. At first glance, I worried if the nefarious one made my favorite comfort food \"froo-froo,\" but my worry was short lived.  BurGR was packed when I arrived, but I wasn't surprised given they had big TV's and an NFL playoff game was on. I got lucky though, and a seat opened fast.   Despite the line, service was a really comfortable pace. I never felt rushed once. I quickly got a cold Innis & Gunn Ale, and set about to planning my order.  I eyeballed the Blue Burger which was topped with arugala and Maytag blue cheese. But a good  burger joint should be able to take requests and so I asked for the one thing that would make this burger heavenly... Bacon.  To my surprise, the bartender told me they didn't offer pork bacon, but rather duck bacon. [insert record scratch sound here...] What?! Duck bacon?!   The bartender implored me to give it a shot... I'm glad he did. Once I got the burger, I was amazed, and a fan... But, getting the burger was the difficulty... I get they were slammed, but the order took a very long time. I always saw Gordon get angry about service time on TV, so I had to take a little off for that flaw.   With my burger I also got the onion rings, and like the burger they were perfectly done and surprisingly sweet. My only other criticism was my dessert, toffee ice cream push pops. Having seen these on reviews, I was let down a little in the presentation. The GR logo on the push pops was a chintzy sticker, which appeared to have been applied by someone who didn't really care that the decal was skewed and bubbled. In GR land, a signature menu item shouldn't look cheap. I also found the pop itself very unsweet. This was more a British flavor, which seemed out of place on the menu of an American-style burger joint.   On the whole I enjoyed BurGR and would dine again, and recommend. I feel BurGR is a fun spin on an American favorite."}
{"text":"Gordon Ramsey Burger lives up to the hype.  His name is done justice as the Masterchef and Hell's Kitchen celebrity chef leaves no flaw in his burgers or his truffle fries.  Both were impeccably good and the service top notch.  As my girlfriend noted, the servers were \"hot\" and \"cute\" as well so there is plenty of eye candy here for the ladies."}
{"text":"Ordered the Oreo/Creme brûlée shake, hells kitchen burger, parmesan truffle fries, and a plain cheeseburger. The Burgers were mediocre at best I honestly would rather have gone to in n out or Holsteins at the cosmopolitan. The meat was dry and the hells kitchen burger was not even spicy. The food is sub part its like Carl's Jr but with a $16 ticket per burger. The oreo shake was okay but hardly a milkshake since 90% of the shake"}
{"text":"Except for the fact that the burger takes 20+ minutes to arrive, this is a solid spot on the strip for a recovery meal. $7 pints with a good selection (get the White IPA).   Also get the Ramsay Burger, not on the menu. Duck fat bacon, avocado, onion and roasted red peppers I think? Whatever, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Cool and casual burger joint but at 5 star restaurant level. Stopped by on our way home from Utah to Cali and of course, being a big fan of Gordon Ramsey, I had to come here and try it. There was a long line but for some reason, my party of 7 were seated in about 5 minutes. Our server, Mike went above and beyond to make sure everything went well and was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us great suggestions. Everything we had from the Honey Glazed Pig Bao Buns to the Chanterelle Burger to the Truffle Fries were nothing short of perfect. Definitely a place that everyone has to try when they're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries and really good. You need to order the fries separately but definitely worth trying out the truffle fries. It's like any normal burger place with shakes on the menu. I usually saw a line build up for dinner after like 6 or so. Get your name on the waitlist and they can send a text when a table is ready."}
{"text":"hell's kitchen burger- so good. It has a lot of flavor and I love how beefy it is. I like that it has enough kick to keep ya hooked, but not too much spice to put your mouth on fire. All the ingredients mix in your mouth to create beautiful fireworks of flavor. The truffle fries were good too! A little dry though....to be honest. If you're on a budget opt just to get the burgers here bc the truffle fries ARNT a total must. Overall experience was great though :)   BUY FOOD HERE INSTEAD OF GETTING FAT AT THE BUFFETS"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by Burgr. We ordered the 5-Spice Chicken Sliders, the Parmesan truffle fries and the Hell's Kitchen Burger. The wait for our food seemed excessive and the tables are packed together pretty tightly. If you're looking to have a conversation, this is not your place. The burger was rare, although we ordered medium, and was under seasoned, but the toppings of roasted jalapeño and roasted tomato helped punch up the flavor. The sliders were missing the pickled scallions but were crispy and the brioche buns stood up well. They just needed some bite - was expecting that with the Sriracha mayo but there just wasn't enough on the bun to provide that extra heat we were expecting. The highlights for us were the fries...really tasty served with aioli and fresh ketchup...and, the server was attentive without being intrusive. Best of all, when you receive your bill, there is an automated survey so that you're able to provide instant feedback."}
{"text":"Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and added an egg on top.  It was delicious.  I think I like Burger Bar, at Mandalay better, and I'm usually not a big fan of Gordon Ramsay.  This was a good burger though.  I easily ate the whole thing.  That with a couple of the many beers on tap, made for a great meal!  We also ordered some sweet potato and regular fries.  They came out hot and crispy.  Service was also good.  No problems and everything went smoothly.  The main reason that BurGR is 4 stars and not 5 is because there was nothing overly special.  The food is expensive for a burger, but it is a good burger and was worth it.  I did want dessert after the meal, but when the waitress brought the dessert menus, I realized that it was just the 4 milkshakes that I saw on the menu earlier.  In addition, they also do not serve any coffee after dinner.  That was a bit of a pain.  I'm slightly confused why they even offer \"dessert.\"  Overall, good meal, and i'm sure i'll be back one day..."}
{"text":"Oh my!!! This was delish!!! I think this is the best burger I have ever had!!!! I tried the Hells Kitchen Burger not too spicy not too dry just perfection. The customer service here was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I was starving when me and my friend got here. It was just the two of us and they told us it'd be an hour wait. They ended up seating us a little earlier. Our food came out super fast which was nice. I ordered the yardburger and my friend got the 3 cheese one. I also got the Oreo creme brulee shake and we split the truffle parmasean fries. Basically after finishing only about a quarter of our food we decided we should have just split one burger because they are huge and skipped the fries. Overall everything was delicious and totally worth the price but I ended up getting sick afterwards. Not sure if it was because I ate it super fast or the quality of the food itself."}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and myself went here for burgers and it was really good! I had the uber cheese burger - yumm! But I asked for the burger to be cooked medium and it was definitely medium rare (way too pink!)...but still tasted really good. Servers were courteous and pleasant. It was a good experience though :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been there at least 8 times and the food is simple and great.  I love the burgers but the deserts are my favorites... Yummy... Sticky toffee pudding and the hazelnut/coffee shake is to die for - got to try it. Jalapeno poppers are all time favorite.  I gave them 4 stars bc they are not consistent and their fries sucks :(  I order the sweet potato fires instead of the dry tasteless fires."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good, I have to say the truffle Parmesan fries were out of this world, it would be worth going back just for the fries.  The whole decor and ambiance was very cool, it's a perfect upscale burger joint.  We also got the farm burger, hells kitchen burger, and chicken wings.  We decided on this order from other Yelp recommendations so I won't repeat what's already been said.  Everything was very good but I don't think i could justify more than a half hour wait just on the quality of food.  Side note, we realized once we were seated that there were about 5-8 empty tables in the restaurant at all times while there was a line of 15-30 people outside.  I get that they leave a few tables open for VIPs and such but it seemed like an awful waste with so many people waiting to be seated.    The milkshakes were a strange concept.  They were obviously trying to be different by putting a fist full of pudding at the top of the drink, but once all the milkshake beneath it was finished, it was very difficult and strange to try to suck the pudding up through the straw.  Also, the draft beers and milkshakes are served in these fancy tall glasses which look pretty cool but don't actually contain much liquid!  I ordered a second beer with my meal but only managed to take a few sips before wrapping up the meal so I asked for a to-go cup.  They were nice enough to bring me a standard sized (like a solo cup) plastic beer cup to pour it into but when I did I discovered it barely filled 2/3 the cup.  At those prices, that's kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Classic burger was SO tasty and juicy! The truffle fries and onion rings were also on point. One of the best burgers I've had in a while. Definitely check it out if you LOVE burgers like I do."}
{"text":"Thanks be to GalPalA for suggesting BurGR.   The line may've looked lengthy but the wait actually wasn't that long.   During primetime weekend (Saturday) dinner time we got seated after 30-35 minutes. Believe me - other restaurants weren't any better. It's Vegas, baby.  Once seated GalPalA was ooh-ing and ahh-ing the goodies heading to neighboring tables lol. So of course I had to glance. Worth the peep -_0  Since this was our first encounter w/BurGR we thought best to order what would be popular.   Predictably we both eyed the Hell's Kitchen BurGR. They had me w/roasted jalapeño peppers. But I dropped the cheese. For GalPalA's sake 0_0  Medium rare request successfully executed. Great job!  The cow melded well w/the roasted jalapeño peppers, oven roasted tomatoes, and sliced ripe avocados.  The hand cut Just Fries partnered well w/the burger. If you fancy condiments, chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup will arrive w/the addicting starch cuts.   Btw one order of Just Fries was just right for just 2.  And oy, had to order the old neighborhood taste of Dr. Brown's root beer :) All was swell.   Next time I'd love to try their Hog Burger. Mangalitsa pork?? Minus the sharp cheddar I'm all for it ^_^"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us as a challenger to the Burger Bar. On day one we tried to get in at the bar. The hostess told us to wait in the line with everyone else who was waiting for a table. We were told that it would be a 10-15 minute wait. After waiting ten minutes, we left as we were no closer to the front of the line.  Day two we tried again for seats at the bar. This time the hostess told us to wait near the bar as it was first-come, first-served. Two spots opened up within minutes. We wished that we had been told the same thing on day one! It's quite loud as the resto juts into the casino.  Once seated we were waited on by a really competent server. She immediately asked if we had Total Rewards cards as holders get a discount on food (nice touch). Check out the ice bar surrounding the taps! They even had La Fin du Monde (Québec) on draught.    My dining companion had a standard burger. He said that it was as good as Burger Bar. I had the fish sandwich. I do not understand why restaurants add ingredients to the final dish that are not listed on the menu. I've never had fish sandwich that came with scallions, but they served it that way. Since I am allergic to scallions, that would have been helpful information before I ordered...  I'd go back, but I wouldn't stand in line for the bar and I'd flash my allergies on an electric sign above my head."}
{"text":"I thought BurGR was pretty good, but not anything mind-blowing.  I really like BurGR for a few reasons:  1. Total Rewards Discount  2. I won a $10 dining voucher 3. Food was on clean, on point, and tasted well 4. Service was impeccable.  I thought there was a lot of things done well.  The server kept talking about \"chef\" and things he recommends/likes so it felt a lot more personable with Gordom Ramsay.  They had an extensive beer list which came out in an iPad (I love tech savvy restaurants).  We had the jalapenos, truffle fries, farm burger, and euro burger.  The jalapenos were good except the dip it came in was cold so when bf got to the 2nd jalapeno his first bite through the dip made the jalapeno cold.  I guess you gotta chill the dip but it was just a little bit of a surprise.  The truffle fries were AMAZING- perfect ratio of crisp outside to inside and the seasoning on it... I really couldn't get enough.  I mark off a star because to me most high-end burger places tastes pretty the same without a crazy amount of sauce which would take away from the flavors of a burger.  The burger was very clean and done well but still imo pretty standard for a good burger.  If you love burgers, you should definitely come try here but yeah in my opinion it's not any better just that it was a good value."}
{"text":"Most recent visit we had the Pretzel Chili Dog with a Caramel shake. Outstanding.  Not the sloppy carnival style Chili dog but a nice chile sauce on the custom soft pretzel bun condiment style + garnish piled on with a terrific tasty hot dog.  Having one of the amazing shakes should be mandatory.  Fantastic service too. Very expensive, grab your wallet.  The Yellow and Orange color scheme is a restaurant secret so guests don't get comfortable. You'll eat, pay your tab and exit. That's why chains like Ihop, Dennys and Bob's Big Boy have always used it and they use it here. When you're done eating, those Home Depot colors make your pea sized brain glow & make ya want out pronto.  World Cup and Stanley Cup, NFL Package, Premier League on the HDTV's, nice atmosphere, sweet as sugar servers,, good menu with a scratch-cooked kitchen.  We like it. Vegan options but you really should stick your thumb in your ear and bowling instead."}
{"text":"Very very delicious burger, almost a 5 star but I'll tell you why in this review. So the place is located inside Planet Hollywood near the front entrance. The inside was very chill, cool, and greeted with nice customer service. As I sat down the waiter have me an iPad to look over the beverages & deserts which is cool that you get to see a clear view of what you want to drink and eat. So ordered the popular European burger which had various types of cheese which was very similar to blue cheese but I forgot the type of cheese it had. I had the meat cooked media cause I wanted that juicey taste. Every bight of the burger was great but the only thing I didn't like was that it put too much of the creamy cheese. Other than that the burger was delicious.  The highlight of the dinner was the awesome epic parmesan garlic fries. These fries is a must to have and their white dipping sauce was epic. So good that even my gf that's not a fries fan, she loved it soo much."}
{"text":"The first time wasn't that bad. We waited, got in after getting the text message, and had some decent burgers and great shakes.   The second time was a little embarrassing to bring a friend from out of town to.   The burgers were still decent, but nothing remarkable. What was really disappointing was the garlic Parmesan fries that were way too salty and could barely be eaten. We wanted to tell Gordon Ramsey that his establishment has ruined garlic Parmesan fries for us forever.   I would give this restaurant one more try before throwing in the towel. Or napkin, as it were."}
{"text":"The food was good. We ordered Hell's kitchen burger and Truffle parmesan fries. The burger was somewhat small for its price but the price is reasonable because of the famous me \"Gordon Ramsay\". The burger was tasty but I found it somewhat dry. We ordered the meat to be a bit read, but it was fully cooked and not juicy. The fries was way better than the burger but salty for my taste."}
{"text":"This review is after my second visit to this restaurant. My first time was two years ago, and I was blown away. They service was good, the food was good, seemed like good quality. I eat organic, so it is difficult for me to find good quality food that i don't get sick from. Being a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, we thought maybe it would be sourced well. Again, my first visit, I really enjoyed.  This time around, I had a bit different experience. I am giving a 3 star due to the service. That was good. Probably waited 20-25 minutes for a table, but that wasn't so bad. The hostess was nice and sat us at a nice table away from others. Friendly, helpful waitress who was happy to bring us anything we needed. Ordered the onion rings, which did taste really good, although our plates were not the cleanest. Not sure if the guy that dropped them off spilled soda that he was taking to another table on them while he was carrying them, or if they came that way from the kitchen, but not really Gordon quality! They are on point with the flavors on their dipping sauces. I'll give them that much. Got the farm burger for dinner and my BF got the 3 cheese burger. Was cooked the way we asked, but the meat was still a bit dry, and just didn't have the same quality as last time (I'm talking, melt in your mouth burger, the first time.). I ate as much as i could, paid our bill and left.  I always judge food quality by how i feel after, as my body is pretty sensitive to foods that are not organic. I felt full for 3 days after this. That's not really a normal thing. I guess I can't really complain because I knew it wasn't organic, but I can tell you that the food has gone down in quality. For what they charge, that is too bad. I will not be eating at BurGR again. :-("}
{"text":"My dinner at BurGR began a string of three new 5-star Las Vegas restaurant dining experiences in a row.  We began here with great hand-cut Truffle Parmesan Fries that resembled steak fries, and excellent Beer-Battered Maui Onion Rings with delicate splinters of Parmigiana-Reggiano Cheese adhering to the battered rings.  For dipping the O-Rings, we were supplied with a creamy Cheddar Ranch Dip and a very good requested Truffle Aioli.  We also received homemade Chipotle Ketchup, specially requested housemade regular Ketchup, and specially prepared requested Mild Yellow Mustard for my American Burger and Diane's Uber Cheese Burger.  I liked all of the sauces and condiments provided but still prefer Heinz Tomato Ketchup over all other varieties.  And, with all the choices at our disposal, I got mixed up switching between the two types of Ketchup on the table and recalling which was which.   The beautifully seasoned and perfectly prepared burgers were flat-out outstanding!  Diane's Uber Cheese Burger featured a large and juicy medium-rare Uber Cheese Burger made with Fontina Cheese and Raclette Cheese (it also normally comes with Goat Cheese if desired), and my American Burger sported a delicious, amply-sized, and moist medium-rare burger with nicely melting American Cheese, Butter Lettuce, pickles, onions, and a small Heirloom Tomato.  Both burgers were sheltered in a nice soft Poppyseed & Sesame Seed Bun.  For good measure, Diane also enjoyed a thick and well-received Mixed Caramel Pudding & Chocolate Shake with Whipped Cream, that was accompanied by a Toffee Cookie.  This is a shake to be reckoned with!  Service was friendly, professional, highly accommodating, and very efficient.  The only off note was that I had to get a new appetizer plate after finding a bit of food crud stuck on the one originally presented to me.  While this is at heart a burger joint, it is a high-class one, with exemplary quality control.  For example, I observed an expediting chef inspecting each finished dish as it reached the pass before approving it for delivery to tables, just as Gordon Ramsay often does in \"Hell's Kitchen.\"  You won't find this occurring in many establishments that feature hamburgers as their primary entrée!  We arrived at 10:00 p.m. on a Tuesday, and were seated about 5 minutes after our arrival.  Even though I've been told that the lines can be amazingly long on other days and times, that will not deter me from returning here again and again.   The burgers are just that good!"}
{"text":"I loved it here! This is more than just a regular burger place (and the pricing reflects that.) I had the Farm Burger which has duck bacon on a steak burger and a fried egg. It was cooked to perfection and delicious. And what is a burger without fries? I ordered the truffle, garlic and parmesan version. It was very large, (enough for two), not too overwhelming truffle flavor. And then the shake, creme brulee oreo. It was the highlight! Awesome! Burger, fry and shake? $45.11 Wow, but this is high end even for Vegas. Worth trying and even worth sharing. Ill be back!"}
{"text":"Since I watch Hell's Kitchen I decided to try this restaurant.  We went on a Wednesday around 1130am and did not have to wait at all for a table.  The atmosphere was nice but since it is located inside of a Casino it was a little loud.  The food was great!  We had the Farm Burger, Hell's Kitchen Burger, Just Fries, and Shake #4 (creme brulee pudding and oreo shake).  I am personally not a fan of creme brulee or oreos but our server highly recommended it so I gave it a try...surprisingly AMAZING!  The shake was definitely sweet and I probably would not be able to drink the whole thing myself, but it was perfect to share.  The customer service from our server, Ian, was great!!  However, the hostesses at the front were not that friendly at all.    If there was an option I would give this restaurant a rating of 4.5"}
{"text":"I'm in love with Burgr. Honestly I don't even want to tell anyone about it because I don't want the lines to get any longer. I came here three times the last time I spent a weekend in Vegas. My friends think I need an intervention but they don't understand the Gooey Fries, the Uber Cheeseburger, or the SHAKES. Honestly it was amazing the first time I tried it last year and it hasn't disappointed since. Burgr, Burgr, Burgr. Also the Tuna Sliders are so good if you want something a little lighter.   In practical terms, this place is also reasonably priced for good food in Vegas. It's not cheap but it's worth what one pays. Gordon Ramsey is my guardian angel."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect, but boy was I happy!! My bff and I sat at the bar after a 15 minute wait. They estimated 25 min, which I didn't mind. I got the Truffle Paresian Fries with the Hog Burger! It made me want to slap my momma!!! DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"The service was horrible..she never return to check back to see how everything was. Ginger our server was very unprofessional. We waited forever for our food. Overall the food was great but I would definitely not suggest having Ginger wait on you."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday. Waited about an hour which is fine because you are in a casino shopping mall.... Hello?! Perfect location. They notify via text when your table is ready- AWESOME.  You get to the table and have your basic menu and then are handed an iPad to review the drink menu. It worked bc I got one of the mojitos off the darn thing. I can't remember which bc I had a few to be frank.  I ordered the euro burger- goat cheese, arugula, roasted tomato and truffle oil. Seriously- AH-MAZING. I got the sweet potato fries which were crispy, stellar and delicious however I would pass on ordering with a burger next time as they are REALLY more of a dessert fry... Is that an oxymoron? Maybe, but it's true! They were sprinkled with powdered sugar..... Would have gone great with our sticky toffee pops.  Which brings me to my next point. With all the hype on these pops I fully expected them to blow me away and they just didn't. They had been in a really cold fridge or freezer and tasted good but just not super.  Would I come back? Heck yes! Go shopping and have them call me when my table is ready! One mojito please!"}
{"text":"I ordered the hog burger. Overall, it was an excellent burger. My only complaint was that I couldn't really taste the pulled pork hidden underneath the melted cheese. While an excellent burger, I don't think it was worth the 1.5 hour wait."}
{"text":"Literally the best burger I've ever ordered. Had the Hell's Kitchen Burger. Staff was great. Very friendly and attentive. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Having shows dedicated to improving restaurants & capitalizing on their venue & food, I wasn't doubting that the food/experience was going to be anything but short of AMAZING!  The entrance is hard to miss as it is literally on fire. lol.   The hostess could use a little professional etiquette classes. We made reservations 2-3 times over the phone because they lost our reservation 5 mins after making it when we called back to change the time.   When we got there, they told us to wait & we did for 10 mins then finally after observing that there was a ton of open seating available my friend went up tot he hostess podium & asked how much longer it would be & all 3 of them (all girls) looked at her like \"you guys were waiting?\" smh. GR - it could deter customers if your hostesses are clueless, FYI.  I ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries which was a big enough serving for me. So yummy! I had a little bit of my friends Sweet Potato Fries with honey jalapeno mayo dipping sauce & it was BOMB! YUMMMMMYYY! Recommend for sure! The containers the fries comes in can be taken out of the metal holder & you can just walk the strip while holding the fries. \"On-the-go!\"   I also ordered SHAKE #4: Creme Brulee Pudding.Oreo Shake.Oreo Cookie. OMGOMGOMG, HEAVEN! 'nough said. Try the shake & it'll speak for itself.  All my friends got burgers & I swear their burgers were PERFECT, my friend said they looked like crabby patties, lol.  The attire states \"business casual\" but you can go casual for sure.   They have a photographer that comes around & takes pics that you could potentially buy. We passed.  The waiter we had didn't like that we didn't tell him in advance to split the check. Gave a little attitude but whatevs.   The FOOD definitely saved this review because the service wasn't up to par.  Just sayin'"}
{"text":"So good.  The restaurant is really nice and modern, and the staff is friendly and attentive. We tried the five spice chicken sliders as an appetizer - delicious! I thought the Sriracha mayo would make them really spicy, but it was a nice balance of Sriracha flavor without tons of heat.  The Hell's Kitchen burger is sooo good. The bun is toasted well, the meat is cooked to perfect, and the toppings are great. The American burger was also really good - simple and delicious.  The fries are nice and thick, crispy, and yummy. They're served with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup - fantastic! The curry ketchup is so delicious. I could eat it in place of regular ketchup forever.  I would definitively recommend going. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is good. It can be a bit pricey for burgers but it is not too badly priced. Many times I have walked by and the line is outrageously long. Do not wait, it is not worth the hour or more wait try going at an off time and you will be much happier!"}
{"text":"5/11/2015  Gordon Ramsay Group 539-547 Wandsworth Road London SW8 3JD Tel: 02075921360     To whom it may concern,    $139.04 is the price I paid on 3/24/2015 for the embarrassment at my father's 55th birthday dinner. After talking up Gordon Ramsey's BurGR restaurant to my mother and father for months and convincing them to watch and both of them actually ending up loving Hell's Kitchen and Gordon Ramsey, I had to suffer the embarrassment of this rag that looks as if someone used it on the floor inclusive of the stains and tears, this is the way it looked when I unrolled my silverware, which was asked to be replaced by the staff. I would have mentioned the rag to the waiter, however I decided against it as to not let my mother and father's idea of The Gordon Ramsey Group and his reputation go up in flames in their eyes. The staff was pleasant with exception of the young female hosts at the entrance who seemed as everyone standing in line was a bother to them. I do not want nor expect a full or partial refund; the food was just as good as I remember from my last 3 trips to Las Vegas. I was tempted to post this on social media; however I understand that management cannot fix a problem if they are unaware of it. In the future, I simply hope this won't happen to any other Gordon Ramsey fans out there. Should you feel the need to contact me for any reason, you may do so at the phone number above.

{"text":"Totally overrated.  I don't think any of the beef here is grass fed, organic, or all natural. It tasted like the patties were previously frozen which is ridiculous if you're going to pay $15+ dollars for a burger. The jalapeno poppers were obviously pre-frozen with an inconsistent temperature. The only thing that was kind of good here were the onion rings. The staff here was effective and accommodating. We had two drinks, two appetizers, and two burgers; I think the bill with tip came out to around $90. If you're going to drop that kind of coin, go to the Bacchanal buffet at Caesars palace or another good buffet. This place is a joke and sometimes the line is long. Do yourself a favor and don't eat here unless you like cheap beef  in your burgers and  pre-frozen appetizers at a premium price."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. I was very pleased with everything! Service was impeccable. I ordered a Euro burger mid rare and truffle fries. Every bite was amazing. If you like spicy, try the jalapeno margarita. It's garnished with basil."}
{"text":"Okay so it's date night and the GF and I decide to try out Gordon Ramsay's Burger spot in Planet Hollywood. As much as I disdain PH as a property, my experience with BurGR was actually pretty good! We arrived right around 5:00 pm on a Friday.  SERVICE -  We arrived early enough that there wasn't a wait. Hostess was friendly and prompt. The restaurant was quite full, mostly of people visiting the valley I suppose. The wait staff and support were attentive and responsive to assorted requests (like paper napkins). Drink order was taken immediately and our water glasses were never empty.  FOOD -  BurGR is a premium burger place. While I think \"premium\" and \"burger\" are somewhat conflicting, this establishment makes a solid effort to deliver a casual+ experience.  We opened with some apps; the Bao Buns, Fury Chicken Wings and a Chili Dog. The disappointment in this group the obvious one. Bao Buns ?!?!? At a burger place??? What was EVERY on my mind??? Definitely out of place on the menu and on the taste buds! The wings and the dog, however, are worth the order. Both were flavorful and well prepared.  We both had burgers, obviously, and they were really well prepared. Buns were toasted and soft, not too dry or stale. Beef was cooked to order and prepared perfectly; A+ here.  We ordered the truffle fries as a compliment. The fries were great, but give a thought to the dipping sauces as some of the combinations get a little funky. All and all very satisfied with the meal. *small disappointment on dessert choices, only shakes are available*  ATMOSPHERE -   This is a premium casual restaurant and, for me at least, I don't like seeing shorts, flip flops, baseball caps, and tank tops in the dining room after 5:00 pm. Granted, this is an establishment on the strip, but if that's your crowd move your price point to $7-$8 for a burger, not $13-$25.  The place is active and loud, so it's more suited for a group to meet before an evening out on the town or to precede an active date night. Energy is UP!  Last thing, be aware that the seating is unusually short/closer to the ground, than most places. I'm 6'2\" and it felt like my knees were practically in my chest. Not horrible, but ...unusual.   All and all, I invested $148+ tip and had an \"ok\" evening. I would go back with friends from out of town and maybe sit at the bar on the next trip."}
{"text":"Greeted nicely and promptly when we arrived. Service was polite and good, food was very pricey: 2 burgers, wings, 3 beers...$70 plus tip...WOW!  Typically I don't mind paying and never complain about price, I just think this was way over the top."}
{"text":"Oh so good burger... Hot the blue burger. And the truffle aioli with the fries? Really?  I could eat it on its own!  Ambience? Loud. Food? Oh yeah! You go Gordon!"}
{"text":"???????? ?? ???????? ??????? ?????????  ??????? ?????????????"}
{"text":"We had amazing service even though it was really busy on Sunday night. The parmesan onion rings and fries were awesome and my husband and I had one of the best burgers we have ever had! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place 5 stars but the seating experience and lack of organization in the front of the restaurant brought it down quite a bit.  The food...excellent.  Burgers were cooked how they should be an the sides are extremely well done.    We stood in the 2 top line for around 35 minutes after being told it would take on 15-20.  I get that this is a hot spot but the three young girls at the front had no clue what they were doing.  The lack of management and/or direction from anyone with authority was evident.    Once seated, the server took a while to get over, again, I understand because it's busy, but when you see other servers busting their hump with the same amount of tables, it's disconcerting.  It took a good 5-8 minutes to get drinks and when we ordered those, we knew ordering food at that same time was the better choice.  Food came out in reasonable time considering it's a gourmet burger restaurant.  I think the server came back once and it was less than 5 seconds.  We spent more time with the runners than her.  To the meal....man, it was good!  I had the hell's kitchen burger and my wife had the american.  Both came out a perfect medium rare.  The buns were to die for, a perfect combination of flavor and texture.  To top it all off, the onion rings and parmesan fries are top notch, if I were to go back, I wouldn't order both because of size and would have a hell of a time deciding.  Paying was ok, I like that they have a survey in the bill holder that you can fill out right away, very classy and allows you to communicate your like or discontent before you forget.    All in all, it was good.  Had I not gone to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill earlier in the week and had such a wonderful experience, i'd write the Brit and his restaurants off altogher.  However, if given the chance again, I'd go to either in a heartbeat.  Get there early and you should be fine.  We went Sunday morning and it was packed by 1130a."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, great lighting, amazing interior.  As starters, we got the ahi poke sliders and it was super good.  As entree, we got the Hell's kitchen and Euro burger. They're both amazing but personally the Hell's kitchen is way better. It was really spicy though, they put a jalapeno piece in the burger, so I just took it out.   We also got the $11 cheesey fries. It was muchhhh, we left quiet a lot of fries."}
{"text":"Lives up to its name. Food is well prepared and the service is amazing. I ordered the farm burger which was delicious and truffle fries. I found some interesting things about this place. The menu has a cool design of gordon ramsay, also they bring you an ipad to look over drinks and desserts and at the end a little survey on an ipod  The reason i am giving 4 stars is that the burgers are great but not the best i tried. Lacking a custom build burger menu in my opinion."}
{"text":"without a question, the best burger joint I've ever been to.  I started with stuffed jalapeno's (not cosco one's either) which each came in their own shot glass (each pepper........6 of them) with a sauce in the glass......very well presented and taste to match.  I had the uber cheese burger which was the best burger ever. I also ordered the gooey fries (minus egg) and they were the most awesome fries I've ever had anywhere, anytime. Service was impeccable and the food the best burger joint ever.  I found it clean.  HARD to get in unless you are a platinum + gambler at Hard Rock/Paris/Ceasers chain."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of hype for this place.  Maybe I came on a bad day but I will be back to give it another shot.  Ordered farm burger which was good.  Got 2 sides to share, the sticky toffee push pops and honey baked bao bun.  Those were ok.  Next time I'm coming here, I'm having one of my buddies' order for me, I seem to be the only one to have this opinion."}
{"text":"Good juicy HUGE burger.  The hostesses look like they should be propositioning tourists at the bar....tacky hooker attire hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"I will say we got off our flight and were famished and thought a good'ol burger would hit the spot. This was the perfect place for me since I hadn't had a burger in 3 years. I didn't want Mickey D's to be my reintroduction to them. Fancy pants.   I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and pretty much ate the entire thing. Cooked medium was perfection. Our table also shared all three versions of fries. We're a little carb happy sometimes.   The setting made for some great people watching too."}
{"text":"Came here during a trip with friends to vegas. We ordered appetizers: Onion rings, truffle fries & hot wings.  The onion rings were good and crispy and the hot wings were yummy with bleu cheese crumbles on top. Truffle fries were good, more cheesy than garlic. They brought the fries after we had gotten our burgers so we had started to get full by the time they showed up :(   I shared the farm burger with my friend and it was just enough for us to be full after all those appetizers. It's their standard beef burger with bacon and a runny egg. The bun was soft and soaked the egg really well. The meat was juicy and tender, one of my fave burgers of life even.  The menu has a bunch of preset burgers including a unique pork one that my friend ordered. I kind of wish you could build your own burger like they do at other burger places. It was a good experience!! Especially sitting under a huge photo of gordon himself haha"}
{"text":"YUM! Hubby and I split the blue cheese burger and we added duck bacon.  Wished after the fact that we had both ordered our own! The sticky toffee pops where also delish!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, great variety of craft beers. Service was excellent too."}
{"text":"We came for lunch and got a seat right away. We started with the roasted jalapeño poppers which were served in little cups. These were good and spicy.  My daughter got the Hell's Kitchen burger and loved it.  I got the fresh roasted chili dog and it was amazing but huge!!  Dessert, had the shake. This is a must try place to eat in vegas."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Gordon Ramsey's so I wanted to check out one of his restaurants while in Vegas. The burger place seemed like the perfect one to try at lunch.   Let me tell you, it does not disappoint. I ordered the Ramsey burger and it was delicious. My boyfriend enjoyed his farm burger even though it was lacking the lettuce. The Parmesan truffle fries and its dipping sauce are great too!   We walked out full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"I had never experienced a Gordon Ramsay restaurant before this past weekend and I wanted to do it without spending a ton of $$. This menu fit the bill.   The wife and I went at 11pm on a Sunday night and had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The hostesses were very friendly and helpful.   Our server (Tammy) was top-notch. Seriously, one of the best servers I've ever had anywhere. She knew the menu back and forth, was lots of fun and kept me topped off with water at all times. Huge points for that.   The beer/wine/cocktail list is presented to you on an iPad which I thought was a great touch.   Newcastle battered onion rings were great as an app, and both burgers (Hell's Kitchen and Euro) were outstanding   This place doesn't disappoint"}
{"text":"haoamammmmmmmm I've been wanting to try BurGR ever since they opened and I was ecstatic to have a chance to this weekend!  The fire decor on the exterior of the restaurant is definitely eye catching!  Their seating service was convenient, in that we notified the the host, and they wrote down our number, giving us an ETA and a text of when our table would be available.  Skipping the line waiting was the best feeling ever!  Wasn't too hard to pass time as the surrounding area of Planet Hollywood is filled with shops and gambling!    When we were notified of seating, I was relived to be seated in a very \"relaxing\" environment. With no actual line queue for the restaurant, I feel that everyone was relived, and there was no rushed eating/squished dining quarters to accommodate demanding hungry diners!  Since my group ordered a lot of appetizers, we all split a burger between 2 people, which went perfectly!    Jalapeno poppers were great and fun, in that of the 6 served, 1 was extra spicy!  Truffle fries and sweet potato fries were also delicious accompaniments.  you definitely have to try the MILKSHAKES!! I believe it was #4, but there was creme brullee and cookies and cream.  It was a heavenly experience.  The handful of sips i stole off my cousin were amazing.      BURGERS ARE PERFECT YES.  They are cooked exactly how youd want them, whether it be med rare, med etc!! and you can tell they use good beef.  It was unlike any other burger I've ever had, nice and hearty mmm.  Next time I want to try the farm burger!  Pricing is very reasonable, ~15/16 per burger.  Compared to Umami Burger, Gordon Ramsay is completely worth it.  The burger sizes are larger, and the tastes are still amazing."}
{"text":"Haters gonna hate! This burger was the epitome of juicy deliciousness. Well worth the $15. There was SO much flavor packed inside every bite and let me tell you I enjoyed my Euro burger medium rare down to the last bite. Not to mention the truffle & sweet potato fries were complimentary amazing! We had a party of 5 and were seated within minutes. Our wait staff was awesome & attentive and even the manager came by to check in on us. I normally don't like to revisit an out of town restaurant because there are still so many new places to try but I would definitely go back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Tried to go here on a weekend one time but skipped it due to the hour plus wait. A coworker and I went midweek and got in quickly.  We started with the onion rings which were quite good. Nice batter, crisp, not overly thick. They came with chipotle ketchup and a cheddar ranch sauce which was fantastic.  Friend ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger which he said was a lot spicier than expected but still delicious. I had the Britannia burger (cheddar + mango chutney) which was quite good but I would have liked to had a little more bite from the cheddar.  We also had the regular fries which were some of the best I've had in a long time. Piping hot, crisp on the outside, fluffy inside, and perfectly salted.  One of the top burgers I've had in town. Other noteworthy burgers are at Burger Bar, DW Bistro, Ogden's Hops & Harvest, and Nob Hill (which closed to make room for Pub 1842 which doesn't have the same amazing burger)."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time!!!!  Standard here is nothing like what you see him demand on his show. Took an hour to get a burger and it was not busy. Order was wrong . So she went in the back and just pull things off burger that I did not order. Then when I asked her if that was what she did she said yes ...then waited agin and it was wrong again.  Onion ring are dripping in grease. The staff here is hopeless ... Not a clue on how to serve.  Maybe Gordon should spend some time here and work on his on restaurant . I so wanted to love this place..... Could have gone to In and Out burger"}
{"text":"This place is so good! But the line was soooo long! We got there at 5:30 and there was already a long, slow line. It was so slow we decided to get take out instead. But even that took about 45 min for us to finally get our food. I got the pork burger- it was very tasty! I really wanted to taste their fries but they messed up my order! :(  if you want to eat here, I recommend going between 2-5 when they supposedly aren't as crowded. I want to come here again but I don't want to wait in line!!"}
{"text":"My first time in one of GR's restaurants...atmosphere was just as I expected...kind of noisy and fun.  Not a great place to go if your looking for some quiet romantic time with someone.  Service was very good, very cool restaurant design...a really nice over-all look.  Food was excellent!  I would highly recommend the \"Hells Kitchen\" burger.  My wife ordered the jalapeño poppers which were awesome and were plated standing up in shot glasses and cheese sauce--very cool.  Lastly, the shake...I don't recall which shake she ordered but think the #2, it was superb!  Looking for a great burger on the strip...here's the place, I would go back."}
{"text":"I loved my Brittania burger. Mango chutney was a nice touch. My medium rare was perfect. I also ordered the the Oreo shake. That was a little over the top, but good. Definitely didn't finish it. Oddly the (tall blonde man with thick glasses and tight shirt) waiter was kinda mean in maybe a playful way...?! Not sure what that was about. The woman next to me was also mystified...is he mad at her? Does he want us to hurry up? Is he somehow flirting? Minus one star for weirdness of the waiter. The other waiter (tall [cute] Asian man with tattoos) was attentive and nice."}
{"text":"I had the farm burger, great combination of creamy yolk and crispy duck great bacon over a medium well patty(my preference) and a side of truffle fries! The aioli is really delicious. They update their menu too. so the next time you check this restaurant, You may find a new burger on the menu"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!! I ordered truffle frys and a burger with duck bacon. Everything was cooked perfectly. They had a large selection of beers on tap. I ordered a Samuel Adams cherry wheat. It's hard to find but they had it!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in to burGR with high expectations and were significantly let down. The service was poor and the food was mediocre. The burger choices were no more outstanding than you can find at other burger specialty restaurants on the strip. I ordered the soba noodle salad and was sick from the salad as soon as I left the restaurant. The delivery of the food was poorly timed as the appetizer arrived before our drinks did. I wouldn't recommended nor visit burGR again."}
{"text":"Party of two, so we were seated quickly. Got the Britannia burger and Parmesan fries. Not enough mango chutney on the burger, couldn't taste it. The meat was quality and cooked perfectly. Bun was awesome. Fries were disappointing because they were soggy/wet. My co-worker got the sweet potato fries... Much better than mine. Service was very good. Burger, fries, diet coke and tip = $37, ouch."}
{"text":"I feel like I was torn between 3 and 4 stars but decided to give it a 4 star rating.  It's located inside Planet Hollywood.  WAIT: Make sure you know, the line of people is for groups of 2, if you have a bigger group you have to \"check in\" at the front and it's usually an hour or so wait, because the restaurant isn't always filled, when we ate we saw there were empty tables...  ATMOSPHERE: More casual, open kitchen, with a modern feel.    FOOD: I got the farm burger (egg!) and got it medium rare.  I also got the truffle fries and the other people in my group got the sweet potato and regular fries.   Each of the fries comes with their own two dipping sauces (ketchup, aioli, truffle sauce etc.) and they come in those cone like containers.  The fries are cut fatter than normal, which I didn't really like.  The truffle fries were good, I just wish they were thinner.  The sauce it came with totally made it though.  They sprinkle some cheese on top too.  My burger was good, the patty was tasty and flavorful - definitely glad I went with medium rare.  The egg could use a little more seasoning but it was perfectly soft and the yolk spilled out when I poked into it.  The bacon was interesting, it was softer and not crunchy (I think it was duck something bacon?) and the bun was the most disappointing.  It looked good but it was kinda meh, just your typical bread bun, not really toasted or chewy like Umami's buns.  Overall, not a bad burger if you're in PH or want to try Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.  They can be a little pricey around $13 for mine I think.    Size wise, they tend to be a little smaller, the guys in the group ate it quickly but I felt like with the fries it filled me up perfectly."}
{"text":"Great burger and atmosphere!  Dining was casual and service was great.  All the burgers ordered were awesome including the Honey Pig Boa Buns. We ordered all 3 fries for the table and they could have been cooked a little crisper for my liking. The dips and homemade ketchup was good but nothing beats good old Heinz which wasn't available."}
{"text":"We got there and waited in line because we had less than 3.  I state this because I think they set that up for the really bright college-going hostesses.  LOL  They finally come over and take us to our seat.  I was really shocked to see how big this place was.  It was BUSY!  When we went it was 103 and we had walked from the Bellagio so I was sooooo thirsty.  It took forever to get our server to our table.  I ordered water and a the Coconut pudding shake. First, the water.  They took forever to get us our beverages.  I almost attacked the poor kid with the water jug and guzzle it all down.  Once we got our beverages, the kid was all over it.  I never lacked water again.  The shake, I can't even tell you how delicious that was.  I don't even like pudding.  This is not like any pudding I've ever had.  I'm glad we order it, because it became our appetizer.  It took forever for our food.  I ordered the Soba noodles.  The grilled chicken with Soracha nothing special or fancy, but it was good.  The Soba noodles were very heavy, thick, dense and I didn't finish them.  My husband ordered the Hell's Kitchen hamburger, which I tasted and loved.  VERY good.  We also ordered the parmesan fries.  WOW  That was definitely a meal of it's own.  Of the two sauces I didn't care for the red sauce by the aioli, was amazing. No wonder he charges $11 for them.  I laugh when people complain that they weren't told that they are separate and cost $11. I think to myself, you did get a menu? You can Read?  Everything is a-la-carte. Pay attention, you are not in Kansas anymore.  The place was VERY loud, but what can you expect? It's Vegas!  We were so full.  A nap was in order.  I gave it 5 stars, because I think the food in general is amazing.  The servers....well...again, it's Vegas.  I'm not sure if the whole deck is being played.  Anyway, it was on the bucket list and we can check that off!!!  Would go again.  No doubt."}
{"text":"I dream of this place at least once a month. AT LEAST. Lucky for me I somehow end up in Vegas.    Jalapeno popper - Love them. Spicy with cheddar ranch to dip into, yum! Also, there's always the \"extra spicy\" one. My friends and I think it's fun to try and figure out who got it.  Hell's Kitchen burger - UGH, my mouth is watering. The grilled jalapeno can be a little spicy ; beware. I asked for the jalapeno on the side the last time I had it.   Farm Burger - SOOOO good. You can't go wrong with egg on a burger.  Shake #5 - The only shake I ever get. Chocolate / Hazelnut pudding on top of coffee shake?! I mean, it's heaven.  I LOVEEEEEE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!  Great service. Very friendly and very helpful. The food was amazing! I had the farm burger and loved it!  Comfortable seating and great environment."}
{"text":"This review would have gained 5 stars if it weren't for the lack of outstanding service I assumed I would receive here.   Our server was somewhat friendly, but my gf and I were pretty much invisible to her. My water was refilled periodically...by random kitchen staff. Our server was MIA for the majority of our time there.   The cherry on top was her dropping off the check, without any eye contact, like a freaking ninja and then disappearing. Am I really not that exciting to look at? :)  Oh, and the food is superb btw. The farm burger was delicious and will definitely recommend.  3 stars: Food  -2 stars: Service.  I enjoyed the food,  but I don't want to be served by our previous server again."}
{"text":"Most importantly: The burger was amazing.  I didn't try the french fries, but my friends liked them. They don't take reservations, and told us that our party of 7 would have to wait 45 mins.  We put our name in and walked next door for drinks.  Less than 10 minutes later they buzzed us asking us to come back.... just as we were getting our drinks.  They could be a LITTLE more accurate with the check-in... The waitresses all had cute outfits on, but ours was a bit pushy about getting us more drinks.  If I was in the mood for a great burger, this would be my top choice, but it's kind of hyped up (Gift shop all around you when you walk in? feels like a tourist trap). I liked it, and would go back, but not in love with it."}
{"text":"Had the Euro buger truffle aioli and goat cheese wih arugula. Great service at the bar they will give you samples of all the tap beers as well"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!  One of our favorite places to go for food in Vegas!  However... note to business owners/management:  The onsite manager stood there and did nothing (except talk to the servers).  It was super busy, and our onion rings were served cold.  When they were re-served, the outsides were crunchy and hot, but the breading in the insides was raw in the bigger rings.  (They looked good, but were not well-cooked).  This problem would have been easily avoided (I'm assuming for ALL customers that day/time) if the onsite manager had taken the time/trouble to actually walk around, or even perhaps sample the products from the different batches.  I laugh when I imagine what Gordon Ramsay's reaction would be if this was his T.V. show and he saw what was going on."}
{"text":"Have you ever bit into something and your eyes rolled back in your head?  Well, maybe not to that extreme, but I did get this feeling that came over me when I bit into the onion ring.   Biting into the burger, I got a similar sensation.  It was excellent.  The next day I went back to try the fish sandwich (we were staying in the hotel).  While I didn't get a rush, it was good and had a quite interesting presence.  Oh, I didn't mention the duck bacon on the burger.  This was my first experience with duck bacon.  It was quite tasty.  It wasn't crispy or anything like pork bacon, just a piece of meat that added more flavor to the burger.    Let's see...what else...Oh, service...Very friendly. The first night there was a wait of about 20 minutes, not too bad.  Second visit was the lunch hour and we walked right in.  This was a Sunday night and Monday afternoon, respectfully.  Servers were pretty quick with the food, but we had to wait for ice tea to brew .  By the time the tea finally came, we were done.  Oh, I forgot the jalapeno poppers I got the second visit.   They were okay.  I love spice, so I wanted to try them.  I didn't particularly like the breading.  They seemed to be popular though, but I wouldn't order them again.  So that's it til next time \"Loss Wages\"!"}
{"text":"This restaurant seems promising given the long wait and high volume of customers. Also, I had high hopes since Gordon Ramsay created this. Sadly, service was slow. It took about half an hour to bring out our burgers. What is even worse, my friend's burger had hair in it. Also, the burger itself wasn't anything too special. I know a burger place in Irvine that makes better burgers than Gordon Ramsay's. I do agree with most people that their truffle fries are pretty good. Other than that, I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience at burgr!! The food was amazing! The onion rings are to die for! Service was great as well even though the restaurant was pretty busy. My husband had the Britannia burger, and I had the turkey burger. Both were exceptional, can't wait to dine here again on our next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100  My boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!  BurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.  We were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.  The decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.  Waiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.  We ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P  My bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!  As for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.  When we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!  Overall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)"}
{"text":"Came here expecting greatness, was very disappointed. Ordered my burger med rare, got it well done. Don't think it would of mattered as nothing on my burger stood out from a burger I could of gotten  from my employee dinning room at work."}
{"text":"Wow.  The food here is great! If you want a great dinning experience this place is perfect, the food was delicious. The host could have set more efficiently as there were open tables and long line to be set.  But the Oreo creme brûlée shake was a winner and the turkey burger and sweet potato fries best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Came here the first night we arrived in Vegas. We were getting married right down the strip, so we decided to venture out and celebrate. Very loud and busy of course, but don't let that stop you from eating here. Everywhere in Vegas is loud and busy. The wait is definitely worth it. If the bar is full, come here and put your name on the waiting list and go walk around for a bit in the shops nearby. I discovered a margarita vending machine place attached to another restaurant that was like $5 a cup. Go there and grab a margarita, then slowly mosey back to Gordon's restaurant. Seriously you cannot go wrong. The food is great, of course. I unfortunately made a self discovery as I was eating the truffle fries. I am mildly allergic to truffle oil.. really. The weekend I was to get married! Which is strange because I have had truffle oil before. (My favorite risotto is topped with truffles.) I don't blame the restaurant one bit for it, but I do blame them for making such delicious chips! Even after I realized I was getting a bit of a scratchy throat and having the allergic reaction, I continued to eat. just.one.more.. I had to eventually stop of course. But I had enough to say, if you are not allergic to truffle oil, order the truffle fries. If you are allergic, just bring an epi-pen. (don't take my advice. no wait, take my advice)  :)"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I think it's safe to say that this is one of the best burger places in Vegas. The servers were very polite and were always coming by to check on how things were going.  The only thing I'd recommend is that you call ahead. I went at 10:30pm last night (on a Tuesday night an hour and a half before it closes) and it was packed. We waited just a few minutes, but it was absolutely worth it. Definitely a must-try for everyone."}
{"text":"BurGR is unbelievable!  We started our night with Mojitos, which were, undoubtably the best I have ever had. Next came Jalapeño Poppers. The presentation of the poppers is awesome- shot glasses filled with ranch with one popper in each. These things were FIRE! And it was great!  As for the burgers, each bite EXPLODES with flavor. Truly a delicious burger.  The waiter was nice, friendly, and helpful. The restaurant was great. I'd recommend this place to anyone heading to Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Our server was Paul, he was great. He became my Vegas best friend. I was completely drunk but that does not mean I was not able to know how amazing this place is. OMG! I WILL be coming back next yr when we return. It might be a wait, but all you have to do is tell them at the front that you have a party of whatever amount of people, they tell you how long the wait is, and you're set to go. We stayed across the street at the Jockey Club and sent someone over to put our name on the list. We got to relax in our room for the hour it took. Showed up, waiting about 5 minutes, and got a seat right away for all 7 of us. It was amazing. The drinks are BOMB!"}
{"text":"After hearing a friend rave about the burger she had, I invited my whole family to have dinner there. Service was good - our waitress was accommodating and friendly.  Food variety was simple but interesting.  We all ordered different burgers and fries. When the fries arrived, they were dry and a bit hard. They didn't taste freshly fried. I needed all the dipping sauces to actually enjoy them.  Burgers arrived. Blue Burger: meat was poorly seasoned, the burger itself was very dry. The only flavor profile was the blue cheese Farm Burger: fried egg was a nice touch, the buns were soft, not as many complaints about this burger than the others Euro burger: super dry. Needed way more aioli, the meat was seasoned, but overcooked. I ordered this medium rare.   The kid's grilled cheese was actually the hit of the night which is sad.  Cocktails were good.  I had high hopes, but the burgers and fries fell flat."}
{"text":"Been to BurGR about half a dozen times already (I'm a local) and wanted to write my reviews of this place.   Pros of this restaurant was the overall atmosphere, friendly attentive staff and service from the hostess, bartender, servers, to management. I always order the same thing. American cheeseburger cooked medium well with no lettuce no tomato with pickles on the side and red union. Truffle Parmesan fries and my Virgin Bloody Mary extra spicy with no garnishs. The bartenders that I know of seem to alway recognize me and remember me and engage in small chat when busy and always check up on how everything with my time there is doing.   I would've given this place a full 5 stars but the following cons of the place made it drop a star . Even though I been there on several occasions I still almost have to always wait more than 15 min for a spot at the bar or table near the bar. I still have to wait what seems a bit long for my burger to arrive and even then they almost always has the meat rare or even raw temperature. Normally when I get a burger that's raw I would send it back but my first time there and noticed the raw meat I had already eaten half of it. Luckily though it was still delicious and most importantly I have never gotten sick as a result of eating here but still feel the cooks can improve on that a bit.   I'm a huge fan of Ramsey and I am actually even friends with some celebrity chefs that have in one form or another known or worked for Gordan directly. I am so relieved that his restaurant has made a positive impact on me, as I've been to many celebrity restaurants and only a rare few had disappointed me.   Now if only BurGR had a customer loyalty reward program......  Thanks and I will be back soon and continue to tell all to check out BurGR."}
{"text":"The wait wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Got seated and the bar, and was immediately grateful for that. The bartender (I think his name was John?) was extremely nice and even joked around with us for a bit. I had the Hell's Kitchen burger, which many have said is spicy. I really like spicy food and can handle a good amount of spice, so I figured what people were saying was a bit of an over-exaggeration. I ordered it, took a bite, and was a bit disappointed because it wasn't all that spicy. However, the more I ate the burger, the spicier it got, which I loved. The food was good, the service was great, and there is a pretty good selection of beer available. Beats the $40 burger and fries that I ordered through room service at my hotel, and cheaper too!"}
{"text":"The food is 5-star, I loved the burgers. Tender, great grill taste with excellent buns and toppings. The patties are big and one burger is definitely enough for one person. Unfortunately we got seated at very front edge of restaurant which intersects their line into the place. This meant we always had an ass in our face as people encroached into our area while we ate and they waited. This tainted the overall experience and I would avoid this table at all costs."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting Gordon Ramsay Burgr. We ordered the Brittania burger, Yardbird, and onion rings. Make sure you arrive a bit early because there always seems to be a line outside, but it does move fairly quickly. Our server was very attentive, however we didn't love being seated next to the server station, with the servers basically just hanging out about a foot from our table most of the time. Tips: Ask for extra sauce on the side. I have gotten the Brittania burger on both of my visits and the first time the mango chutney was barely visible. So I made sure to order extra this time. The Yardbird also had a very sparse amount of barbecue sauce so extra was needed. Overall pretty good!"}
{"text":"Perfect burger. Just enough to satisfy the appetite. Great signature burgers. Extensive beer selection as well. Euro burger is my favorite"}
{"text":"This is as close to Hell's Kitchen as I'll ever get.   We got to sit right at the counter in front of the kitchen. The head chef was a ball buster. Dropping f bombs and asking where our shake was. Just like Ramsey would : )  The food was really good. We had 2 burgers, fries and a banana shake.  Warning: the peppers on the Hell's Kitchen burger are flaming hot. Get them on the side or not at all!  Fun quick lunch."}
{"text":"Farm burger w/ the duck bacon and fried egg was really good. Got the #2 shake which was also pretty decent. Not a big fan of the fries, the chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup were kind of gross, really wanted something more \"normal\" tasting.  Service was great, waitress checked up on us frequently, had a party of 6 people so the wait took 30-45min but we were able to expand it to fit another 2 friends when they dropped in."}
{"text":"You can't ever miss this place. I'm 99.9% sure everyone who has found this place inside the Planet Hollywood casino only did so because of the big wall of fire that has \"BURGR\" smacked across. This place definitely has the looks, but unfortunately the quality of the food is not quite there, especially not for a place owned by THE Gordon Ramsay.   I've been here twice and luckily I never had to wait more than 10 minutes. That's only because the first time I came during an odd hour (4pm) and the second time was because we came with a group of 8 people and they have big tables reserved for bigger parties.   F O O D: I've tried the burgers, a cocktail, onion rings, and the truffle fries. Honestly the food here isn't bad, but it isn't anything that's wow-worthy either. The burger patty wasn't very juicy and the buns weren't perfectly toasted, but it was still pretty good. I enjoyed the sides a lot more--the onion rings were on point and the fries were bomb especially with the truffle butter! The cocktails were whatever, you can pass on that and get a Fat Tuesday in the PH mall instead.   S E R V I C E: This restaurant is pretty big for a burger joint and it's always packed, so expect to wait around 15 minutes for your food. If I remember correctly the waiter is able to split the check per order--so if you have a big group you won't need to worry about splitting the bill because everyone can pay however they want to :)  I would come back again just because I like staying at Elara and this place is a convenient place to grab a quick bite. But honestly it's overhyped and I expected a lot more from you, Gordon Ramsay!"}
{"text":"The service was absolutely impeccable the food was pretty good-what can I say-they were hamburgers. The price was a little high. Two hamburgers french fries and two iced teas with $51, But you do have to take into consideration where you are Planet Hollywood. So overall it was good."}
{"text":"I am a Vegas local, and I had some friends visiting from out of town, this was their last nite in town. So we decided to do dinner here as it was centrally located and we thought it would be a fun place to try. They had gotten there before me, and had just been seated as I arrived.  We were seated around 6p.  There was a total of 5 of us in the group.  It took the waitress about ten minutes to even approach our table, and when our waitress came she was overall nice, but spoke very softly and it was beyond hard to hear a word she said. We started by ordering water and a martini for one of my friends at the table, the drinks took about 15-20 minutes to arrive.  When the waitress returned to take out order, we ordered the jalapeño poppers (which I thought were intended to be an appetizer), a blue burger, uber cheese burger, chicken burger, a standard dawg, and the sweet potato fries.  We waited at least 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and during this time the waitress never came back to check on us, but we saw our server pass by the table consistently and quite often and literally bus the table sitting right next to us, but never once stopping to check in and let us know the status of our order, or simply to just check in and see how we were.  When our food finally arrived, the \"appetizer\" we had ordered arrived with the burgers.... so much for an appetizer!  I liked the idea of the jalapeño poppers being served in the shot glasses with their own dipping sauces, but overall it seemed to ruin the taste and texture of the poppers, they became lukewarm and very soggy! I did not enjoy the honey jalapeño mayo dipping sauce at all, the flavor was just very off and not appetizing. The burgers were juicy and delicious. The sweet potato fries were also good.   Overall the food was good, but I think that the service we had just really ruined the overall experience for me!  We only found out our servers name once we received the check... so I would say if you go- avoid sitting in \"Dorota's\" section if possible."}
{"text":"Another great meal at BurGR. We usually have lunch here but decided to go for dinner. The restaurant is very noisy at dinner. We are platinum TR status so we got to skip the line and were seated immediately.   We opted for just water for drinks. I had the uber cheeseburger, my husband had the farm burger(his usual), and we split the parmesan truffle fries. The burgers were cooked perfect medium rare. The uber cheeseburger was very good, not sure I could taste all 4 cheeses but definitely the cheddar and goat cheese. My husband orders the farm burger every time and he was happy with it. He always gets extra chipolte ketchup that comes with the fries and puts it on his burger. The fries are always great and the dipping sauces go well with them. We are always so full after our meal we can't order dessert. The shakes always look good.   Our waitress was decent, nothing outstanding about the service."}
{"text":"I see a lot of mixed reviews but if you're looking for my opinion, it's not all hype like many other \"celebrity chef\" destinations.  Good solid burgers, guilt-ridden sides that are worth every calorie, and possibly even more delicious pudding shakes make Gordon Ramsay BurgR one of my new favorite burger joints in Vegas.   Plus, his menu makes a cute souvenir.  Brynn and Patta deserve extra points for being stellar in the service department!"}
{"text":"This burger joint left me feeling satisfied. I love trying out new things, and my boyfriend and I wanted to go to a nice place on a date. They sat us at a tiny two person table which was pretty cute but sucked cus it was in the middle of the walkway and everyone's way, but that's okay. Our focus was on each other and the food. Expectations for this place was high, I mean come on it's Gordon Ramsay. The server was very friendly and helpful. The menu was set up really cool, he explained all about it and gave us recommendations. We got a basket of truffle Parmesan fries to share which are delicious and for two people. I ordered the farm burger which has duck breast bacon, cheese, and fried egg (yasssss) and my boyfriend got the Hell's Kitchen Burger which has cheese, avocado, tomatoes, and jalapeño. The fries came out first with two different types of ketchup. I believe one was spicy and the other was like sweet like a Thai taste or something like that. I opted with regular ketchup (sorry I'm basic). Our burgers finally came out and the presentation was very pleasing to the eye! I love the type of buns they use and they were sooooo good. They were smaller than what I expected because a lot of burger joints burgers are huge, but to me they were perfect size. We were definitely full at the end and left happy. The server also gave us two Gordon Ramsay pens to take home. You know I kept that. Lol. Overall, great quality place!"}
{"text":"Now that's a great burger! Really good meat and excellent bun. Had the Hell's Kitchen burger and was very impressed."}
{"text":"Good food. Nice environment. This is a popular place so you can expect a wait but worth the wait. Servers are all pleasant. Large variety of beer!"}
{"text":"Restaurant week deal couldn't be beat! 20.19 Single Meat Burger Any Fries Sticky Toffee Push-Pop  Here we go again... There seems to be a little confusion about this place. When you look online on the PH page and Gordon Ramsay's page they both state that you can make reservations. So taking a lesson learned for,the last time we were here (read my previous review) I thought I would make a reservation. I called the number (same number on both pages) and I was informed that they did not take reservations and that it was first come first serve.  So I am still a little confused as several reviewers said that they made reservations.  I am going on the record to say that they DO NOT take reservations, it's first come, first served.   Check In 2*: We were quoted 1 hour wait time this time. I counted 6 clean and open tables as we walked away from the front podium. (same issue as last time). Now that we know that they do not take reservations why so many open tables? Thankfully our wait time was much shorter 37 minutes from text to text.   Service 5*: Service was 1000 times better than our last visit. Our server (I cant remember her name, Blonde with a half arm sleeve) and her assistant (I cant remember his name either Asian with a fro-hawk) were on point. They were both friendly, offering suggestions on how to pick our combo as well as their honest feedback on their menu favorites and even a bit of casual chit chat.  We never once had to ask for a refill or flag them down.  To Them Thank yo for the awesome service!  Food 3*: On this trip I opted for the Hell's Kitchen burger and an order of truffle parm fries.   As experienced and expected, the truffle parm fries were on point. The best I've had in all of my food adventures (trust me I've had alot of fries!) I prefer this version of truffle parm fries to those found at Bachi. I'm not putting them on blast; Bachi's is good but GR's are outstanding!  The Hell's Kitchen Burger Meh! I was expecting fire and anger come out of this burger like its namesake. Sadly the avocado drowned out any fire and brimstone that this burger was packing. It was almost like eating an avocado sandwich. Previous reviewers have claimed that their burgers had a nice fire or kick to it; mine did not. Maybe the avocado to fire ratio was off... Maybe I just got a dud...  So yet again it was a miss on the burger.  Sticky Toffee Push Pop Ingenious! The delivery mechanism is so simple but sheer genius thus making this dessert and automatic hit! I'm not a huge sticky toffee fan but I enjoyed eating this..     A much improved experience from the first one thanks to the great service, however the customer flow and seating still are in need of improvement."}
{"text":"I was all set to have the best burger of my life when I walked in. I am not sure if I made a wrong menu choice but I was left disappointed. I got the damnation chicken burger and I think it was the blue cheese, it was either too strong or something but it just didnt go well with the other ingredients. I also tried a chicken slider from my mother in law's plate and it was just about OK. We also got truffle fries, again, nothing great but nothing to complain about either.   My father in law loved his fish and crisp sandwich and my husband his burger (dont recall exactly what he got though)"}
{"text":"Spectacular! It was the best welcome meal to Vegas, I would have to say. We just got off the plane, put our stuff in the hotel room and grabbed a cab for the best burger joint. It was certainly the best! Mind you, all of us ladies were HONGRY, just got off the plane BUZZED, and we were dying.   My burger, I think it was the Farm Burger, had a fried egg in it, and that was the one that sealed the deal for me. It was SLAMMIN!!!  Our server was mighty cute too. I think I lost my game. In my single days, I woulda been flirting and making witty comments, but each time he came to check on us, I got hella quiet. Haha. See, that's what marriage did to me!!!"}
{"text":"Wait time is long. That is my only gripe about this place. Other than that the food is excellent and has an edge over other burger places such as Umami Burger and Super Duper on the West Coast.  So first with the wait time: we have a party of five so we go to the front desk and give them our phone number. They text us when our table is ready. Wait time was about 45 minutes and it was a Saturday night in Las Vegas so it was pretty busy.   We started off with some onion rings and truffle parmesan fries. The fries were a bit chewy on the outside but still crispy. It comes down to personal preference but I prefer the crisper fries from Umami Burger. The truffle aioli is very good and is on par with Umami.  I highly recommend the beer battered onion rings. Very crispy and delicious and beats out many other places. Now on to the burgers.  I ordered the farm burger with the duck breast bacon and egg on top and cooked medium. It was very tasty and the iconic bun with black and normal sesame seeds is eye catching. Presentation wise I  love the burger. Extremely well done and clean.    For dessert we got the Oreo shake with creme brule and the push up ice cream tops. Very good desserts but the dessert selection is limited. We still enjoyed it.  Service wise I have nothing against Burgr's service. Everything came out at the same time and was piping hot. Just be prepared to wait 45 minutes for your table if you have more than a party of two."}
{"text":"The Strip is now packed with fine burger establishments. There's probably one in every resort/casino. Mr. Ramsay opens up his newest one right smack in the middle of the Strip at Planet Hollywood. This place will always be packing because of all the foot traffic here.   All the waitresses/hostesses are wearing skimpy outfits that gets stares from the guys. We probably waited 25 minutes for a table. Gave them my digits so they can text me when the table was ready. Walked around the Miracle Mile for a bit.  Seating is close quarters. We can hear the conversations all around. It's eavesdropping paradise. Menus had a hole on the bottom with a slot for the utensils/handkerchief. Waitress brought out drink menu on iPad. All the drinks/pudding shakes where there with a picture and description if you clicked on it.  So I order me some Truffle Fries and a Farm Burger. Burgers with fried eggs makes me go goo goo gaga! I inhaled it of course and it stuffed me like a good meaty burger should. There were juices dripping from my experience afterwards. The fries were pretty delicious too.  The atmosphere is loud and crowded. LCD television screens are mounted up in every direction with sport channels. Service can be slow as it's always seems so hectic in here.  In conclusion: Food = A (Delicious all around) Service = B- (Friendly and attentive but can be slow at times) Atmosphere = A- (Can be a fun place to dine)"}
{"text":"Well you just have to try somewhere with the name Gordon Ramsey on it, even if they can't spell burger!  And try it you well should because it's darn good!  This has a modern and relatively pleasant interior.  The menu design is amazing, anyone opening it is just stunned, you see it on everyone's faces.  In some ways it's a bit much, this is not your moms burgr place!  However food is of course the main thing of importance.....  I got the special Gordon Burger.  I felt this to be an original name for a special in a, well, Gordon Ramsey burger place.  Duck bacon, pork burger. Real English cheddar, arugula lettuce, avocado, peppers. Delectable and I mean one of the best burgers I've ever had, the duck bacon is just awesome and flavorful beyond belief, but the whole combination is true bliss - mind blowing!  Side of onion rings - best I've ever had, thank you England!  Great ketchup too as only is to be expected.  Hello, knock knock - great onion rings and awesome ketchup does it get better than this?  Service too was pretty good, but I'd go for the food alone with this one."}
{"text":"It's loud, sporty, with a whole lot of real flame and orange.  A lot of commotion in the kitchen, but it's all good. They have a full-time expediter, and someone dedicated just to make sure the presentation is perfect.  I had the birds-eye view from the back counter.  There wasn't anybody shouting (Gordon wasn't here).  It was a well-oiled machine.  Everything sounds and looks amazing.  Everything.  I wanted to try it all (and I will be going back many times until I do).  Roasted Jalapeno Poppers (made fresh, and individually served as 6 in a small glass of fiery dip), Five Spice Chicken Sliders, Fury Chicken Wings, all the burgers including the Hog (a pork burger), Fish & Chip Sandwich, Truffle Parm Fries, Shakes, and I could go on and on.  Mouth watering.  Shallow perhaps, but the place makes me happy  I had to try one of their incredible \"dawgs\", along with a burger, and the onion rings.  Each was more reasonably priced than I expected.  Chanterelle Burger ($16) -- chanterelle mushrooms, arugula, figgy-onion jam.  Perfect size, my guess 5 oz.  I suppose it's a simple burger, but it was darn near amazing -- almost made my eyes roll back.  Top 10 burger, for sure, on my \"Berger Knows: Burgers\" list.  Seeded bun, delish.  Onion Rings ($9) - huge.  The breading is very light, has parm splash atop.  Well-seasoned, it had a meat like flavor.  Wonderful.  Fresh Roasted Chili Dawg ($13) - ginormous.  Seeded hot dog bun was fantastic, and dog was top quality, 3 times the size of a normal one.  A bit salty, but the toppings were worthy....and firey hot.  Presentation - 5.0 Flavors - 4.75 Service - 4.75 Speed - 4.0 Ambiance - 4.5  The servers, all attractive, wear short blue or gray skirts with matching top.  Guys, snug fitting shirts with jeans.  Very nice service, very competent kids.  Rounded up, it was a near perfect dining experience and I so want to go back.  Fun, delicious, and had that \"wow\" factor."}
{"text":"At friend's suggestion my coworkers and I dined at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR in Las Vegas. Three of us ordered turkey burgers that were absolutely delicious. The turkey burgers had blueberry compote, small crispy potato strips, butter lettuce, and cheese similar to Swiss cheese on them. Another coworker ordered the Brittannia burger and it was delicious as well. We all agreed the turkey burger was the best we've ever had. We shared an order of the beer battered Maui onion rings and the Just Fries. The onion rings were amazingly good and the fries lived up to their name--just fries, well actually just steak fries. The onion rings are nearly the size of doughnuts and the batter was very flavorful. BurGR has some good craft beer on tap and we had an excellent server.  I understand there is usually quite a wait to get into BurGR. We arrived just minutes before opening time at 11:00 am and were seated right away. Also, you can order the food to go, so if you really want to give the food a try, there are ways to get around the long wait."}
{"text":"I really wanted Gordon to be here, yelling in some corner about how the Beef Wellington was way overcooked. Or undercooked. There was, however, no Beef Wellington on the menu and no Gordon Ramsay to be found.  Speaking of Hell's Kitchen themes that carry on from season to season without fair, there was definitely a direct, not so subtle \"fire theme\" a la HK that I thought was really cool. This made the \"must\" list that we made before coming to Vegas, half for the food, half solely because I'm a GR and a HK fan.  As expected, the food was great. We came in for a late lunch, and even around 3pm, the place was pretty crowded. We both ordered burgers (of course) on the recommendation of the waiter. Both were good, but the Hell's Kitchen burger was definitely the favorite. Tip: Get pickles, then get extra pickles. They are amazing.  We also split a caesar salad, which was inordinately fantastic. Maybe we were hungry, but it takes a pretty nice seat in my top 10 caesar salad list.  Speaking of seats - the chairs. Chairs are chairs, but the specific ergonomics of the chairs here sat us up just straight enough to not have to lean to eat, but left us just relaxed enough to be comfortable. Chairs aren't usually part of a food review for me...but these were so noticeably perfect that they get their own paragraph.  Burgers. Salad. Fire. Drinks. Chairs. Burgers."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. First of all my friends(3 others) and I were sat near the wait staffs register. They complained about someone they worked with and their work drama for at least 20 minutes. They did not care that customers were listening. While we sat there parched listening to their drama. I will leave out names of people they were complaining about because that would be rude even though they aired all the dirty laundry.   Waitress finally came and was super rude. It was loud in there so we couldn't hear her. I asked her to repeat herself and she laughed and gave me a dirty look. I know it's Vegas, but I didn't expect all the ghetto shenanigans at a Gordon Ramsay restraraunt.   Burgers came and omg Bye Felicia. They had no flavor, were dried out, and disgusting. The fries were hard, oily, and had no seasoning at all. Hands down the worst place I have ever ate in Vegas.   If you expect food to be amazing please don't go here. Bomb food at wicked spoon buffet, Aria Buffet, and hash hash a go go.   And if you wondered if the food was free. Guess again we still had to pay. Lol. Welcome to Vegas."}
{"text":"Very solid for the price.  I like to rate things relative to others in a similar price category.  The burgers were very good, the standard fries were pretty bad. They were limp and with odd condiments in lieu of ketchup, which neither of us enjoyed.  They were bad enough that I considered sending them back but I didn't feel like making a fuss.  The drink I ordered was one of the best specialty drinks I've ever had and the dessert (the creme brûlée & Oreo cookie shake) was positively incredible.  Our server was a little more aggressive than I like, but was good at his job. All in all, worth coming back for."}
{"text":"Easily the best burger I've ever had! EVER!  I went on a Saturday with the boyfriend and luckily the wait for 2 was about 40 minutes. Could've been seated within 20 minutes but we decide to wait for a table. Be sure to check in at the front before you wait in the line they have marked off. The line was only for parties of 2. If you had 3 or more the wait was about 2 and a half hours long. (note to self: never come with a party of 3 or more)  Moving on to the food. We got onion rings for an appetizer. The onion rings were amazing. I'm not usually a big fan of onion rings because I hate when I take one bite the whole onion ends up coming out of the bread and I'm left with just bread and no onion inside. Their onion rings are a different story. They didn't feel oily like other onion rings as well. The dipping sauce made them taste even better.  I got the Farm Burger, which I highly highly recommend. It comes with duck breast bacon (never had this before but it was delicious), English sharp cheddar, and a fried egg. My boyfriend got the Uber Cheese Burger which just came with three different cheeses. Sounded really plain but it was the best plain burger I've had. Both burgers were so moist and full of flavors. Thinking about it makes me want to drive up to Vegas right now just for the burgers. We also ordered the truffle fries. They were good but I've had better truffle fries before.  Overall our dinner experience was wonderful. Our total came out to be about $68 that's with 2 beers, an appetizer, 2 burgers, and a side of fries. We were way past full at the end of the meal so we weren't able to try the dessert. Which just means we'll have to go back.   This place is definitely my top recommendation for anyone staying in Vegas."}
{"text":"The Best Burger I have ever had!!  And the parmesan truffle fries, OMG....so YUMMY!!!!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong by eating here. Drinks are creative and refreshing. I would recommend the skinny screw and the acai berry drink if you want something with alcohol. I had the Chanterelle burger and added goat cheese and it was so damn good! Service was top notch and the waiter never left us wanting anything for long. I wish I got the name of our blue eyed server as he was the bomb! I will definitely be back here next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Friday afternoon, took about 15-20 to get in which is fine.  Party of 2.    Once I was seated, I placed my drink and food order with the waitress in a timely order.    After that, she never came back.  We received the food from a different worker, never once was asked if the food was good or if we needed anything else.     The burgers were good no complaints.  1/3 of the fries were undercooked so you couldn't eat all of them.    In the end we had to ask a random worker for the check because we had been finished and waiting for 10-15 minutes with no service.   He actually went to tell the server we needed the bill and she didn't even bring it to us.  Someone else did.  Pretty lame.     Burger was good Fries 50/50 Service whack."}
{"text":"The Farm burger was really really good! Duck-breast bacon was AMAZING! Service was quite good. Sweet potato fries with the Jalapeño aioli were great! I had high expectations for my first experience with a Ramsay joint and I can honestly say it did not disappoint! Check it out!"}
{"text":"I give this place 3 and half stars mostly because i have extremely high expectations for something with Ramsay's name on it. The menu has a lot of interesting choices- I went with the Hog Burger. It was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. I would say the highlight of the meal really was the milkshake. They have several flavor combinations, each including an ice cream milkshake topped with a different flavor pudding. I got shake #5, coffee ice cream with chocolate hazelnut pudding. The combination of ice cream and pudding sounds bizarre, but it is quite delicious and the flavor combo i got was top notch. Would go back just for dessert"}
{"text":"Euro and bleu burger with just fries. Nothing plain about it. Delicious specialty ketchups and the most perfect buns and medium burgers. Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"I went here an hour before it closed... or else it will be hours of waiting... and stay away from the flame lit sign, it's not hot but warm around that area...  The dinning area seems like it can seat 100 people... this includes a bar area (where I sat) where you can watch the kitchen work. (Sorrie no cussing or what you except from hell's kitchen)    The servers are super friendly, and they will MAKE SURE your satisfied with your food.   Now the food... holy smokes, I want to try everything, but what caught my eye was \"hell's kitchen burger\" but the server said on the secret menu we have \"Gordon Burger\" and that's what I had. And wow... and the sever also recommended all the smoothies, espically the strawberry and it was the best...  You can earn points for your TR card or get 10% discount for military/veteran"}
{"text":"British Chefs - 1. American Chefs - 0.  Way to go Gordy for beating America at their own game. Pow, tough blow. Sorry!  Ok, joking aside... wow! Hubby and I have been wanting to visit BurGR for quite a while and the wait was totally worth it. Our first night in Vegas with family visiting from England we brought them here and everybody left happy.  The Burger choice that dominated our party of 5 was the Farm BurGR (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww) - $15. Duck Breast Bacon, English Sharp Cheddar and a Fried Egg, oh my! I'm not usually one to have Fried Egg's on well anything really but what a combination. With the Burger cooked medium everything worked in perfect harmony. The Egg was perfect, the Beef was perfect and the Cheddar.. Omigosh REAL Cheese!! I'm getting excited just thinking about it. Honestly the best Burger I have had and I have tried a lot in the last 4 years.  Doesn't it look gooood? http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#TEjwrTxroAEuQetkvvbq_Q  - Fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#f3JKGLIzBcGQ8WBlHkvXJg) - $8. Served with Curry Ketchup & Chipotle Ketchup. The Curry Ketchup was delicious but the Fries themselves really were nothing special, just your average deep fried Potato. You could omit these from your meal and not miss them.   The Milkshakes here are delicious too, more of a Dessert than a Milkshake due to the layer of Pudding on the top of them. My Husband and I decided to share one during our first visit and enjoyed it so much we ended up coming back the following night just so that we could have another. They do take a while to arrive though, probably due to the complexity of making them.  - Shake #4 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#3ESC7tVlSjesQ7UnKDuGRw) $9. Oreo Shake topped with Creme Brulee Pudding, whipped Cream and an Oreo Cookie. Get this one! Seriously. Of the 2 I tried this was by far the best and although Creme Brulee and Oreo together seemed a little wrong to me it turned out to be oh so right.  - Shake #2 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=qVxHqHL_R796u5QSvF6yww&userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#beA0lKBsYSIdxqCK8lp5Qw) - $9. Strawberry Shake topped with Coconut Pudding and a Chocolate Cookie.  Service was fine, efficient but not amazing but once your food arrives who needs someone coming around every 5 minutes checking up on you anyway.  *TIP* Very little wait on a Wednesday evening - 6:30pm, 5 people = 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"A fan of cheese? get the UBER BURGER! three kinds of cheese! what more can you ask for?? lovee it! burgers are a good size..the brioche buns were a nice touch. Ate half my burger.. i didn't want to just throw it away.. sooo i decided to pick off the cheese from the patty..don't judge me..I'm just a fan of delicious cheese.   Gave it 4 stars because we ordered to go..and the hostess said she would text us when our order was ready and she never did! waited 45 minutes until she realized it didn't go through? not cool cute girl..not cool."}
{"text":"You see Gordon Ramsay eviscerate restaurants and chefs for bad food and dirty facilities, so one should expect all his restaurants to offer outstanding delicious food in a clean restaurant. After dining yesterday I question that.  Seated at the bar gave me an excellent view of a filthy back bar area. The menu torn and stained with old food. The placemat burned by a cigarette. Gross.  The food. My burger appeared to be a frozen preformed patty of average quality and just ok flavor. To sum it the fresh toppings and condiments were the best part of the sandwich.  Gordon please stop by and whip this location into shape!"}
{"text":"This place was highly anticipated and I was not dissaapointed ! I loved the turkey burger it was sooooo good . I watch a lot of chef Ramsey's cooking shows and I was excited to finally try out one of his restaurants. It 100% lived up to my exprectations . I went on a Thursday night and we were seated immediately . The burger was 14 dollars but it is well worth it . The decor of the restaurant is also very cute and modern . If you are in Vegas and need a bougie burger and fries this is a must try !!!"}
{"text":"Great burger, great fries, great wines by the glass. Perfectly cooked and seasoned burger. I had the duck bacon and fried egg on mine. I'm a Burger fanatic and it was awesome. Go early or you'll wait for ever."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a burger late at night or anytime.  Portabello truffle fries are a must."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Love that you can check in and leave your number. They text you when ever your table is ready so you don't neeed to wait in front of the resturabt for hours. The beer I tried was the Innis and Gunn. Props to the waiter for suggesting it. It is an amazing beer from Scotland. I recommend that if you are a fan of tap beer."}
{"text":"Loudest restaurant I've been to in years; too loud to have a conversation. Good service; however the burger I got was average at best. The cheese on the Uber Cheese burger wasn't melted and that was all that came on it; no onions, lettuce, nothing. The bun was good though and my husband enjoyed his burger well enough. Probably would not return; too many other places to try."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars, but my burger really dropped it back to 3.  This is a smaller restaurant, compared to Ramsay's gourmet steak house in Paris, but it is casual and more inviting. Service was good, and we ordered:  Farm burger: The duck bacon honestly tasted like normal bacon. There really wasn't much of a change from \"bacon burger.\" Still, quite a hearty meal, as bacon tastes wonderful, be it duck or pig.  Earth burger: My portabello shroom burger was filled with these yummy shrooms, and it was bun-less, making it look slightly wimpier than my friends' burgers. I didn't mind though, but when I bit in, the shrooms were INCREDIBLY salty, to the point where I almost didn't want to eat it! Maybe I should have asked for no cheese, as it may have enhanced the saltiness of the shrooms, but oh man! It was also very oily (also possibly due to the melted cheese) and I really felt like I didn't have a good meal.  Just fries: Definitely no soggy fries here. I think I would have preferred the fries to be thicker, but it was still good. The curry ketchup was the favorite at our table.  Sweet potato fries: I normally dislike fries with sugar, but the vanilla powdered sugar really made the difference! Delicious, especially with the honey mayo. I killed this appetizer easily and with joy.   Overall, this is a good restaurant, but I think next time I will need to ask them to halve the sodium and nix the cheese."}
{"text":"First timer. Ordered medium well burger. Rare burger came half hour after order placed, given no explanation. Apps came out late as well. Rude manager, argued in front of other customers. Wrongly excused from restaurant. Server gave the names needed to expand my concern. Can't bare to stand looking at this place after treated this way! Communication with kitchen and customer relations with management clearly need to be addressed and fixed accordingly to prevent further sales loss. Contacted TR and will be in touch with GR Holdings Limited. Not a very inviting establishment to represent pH at this time."}
{"text":"We did takeout and it was really good.   $15 for a hell's kitchen burger which is amazing.  It was so delicious, the meat just melted right in my mouth.  The seeded bun was also yummy, especially when they toast it with butter.  The chipotle ketchup on the side was so yummy I could eat it alone.    The truffle fries were very tasty and pricey, but they need  to lower the garlic taste of the fries.  It was overpowering.  The truffle aioli tames it down and reminds you that they are truffle fries and not garlic parmesan.  I would definitely go back here just for their burger.  We had a wagyu burger with shiitake mushrooms at Tommy Bahama the other day and Gordon's definitely beat his."}
{"text":"Had to wait in line for about 30 minutes to get seated for two people. So come hungry, but be prepared to wait for a seat.   Once we were seated we opened up the menu and couldn't help but to laugh when we saw Gordon Ramsey's picture as you open up the menu into the delightful curated menu. Everything sounds as delicious as the menu makes it. We took a recommendation from our waitress and ordered the jalapeño poppers to start off. And phew they were spicy! Delicious, and very flavorous with spices that are not expected. Definetly kicks you awake.  After that I had ordered a Aoili burgr. It was absolutely delicious, so very rich with flavor. That it was overwhelming to finish the big burger in one sitting. So I definetly took a quarter of it for munchies later as well as the jalapeño poppers. Had a great experience here and would definetly recommend it for anyone else visiting planet Hollywood or the strip in general!"}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated. The food was good, but not worth waiting in line for. Luckily I came here right when it opened for lunch on a weekday, and didn't have to wait at all.   The service here is great. Our server was very nice and knowledgeable about the beers they had on tap. The place is very modern, and the flame-lit sign outside is pretty cool.   We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, and the Farm Burger. The Hell's Kitchen burger was just OK. The peppers tasted a bit pickled, which I wasn't expecting. The Farm Burger was very good. It came with a fried egg with a runny yolk, and duck bacon. We ordered parmesan truffle tries which were very good. I think one order is good for two people, or even three if you don't eat a lot of fries.   Overall, not bad, but I don't think I'd visit again since there's probably other places to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely favorite burgers and fries (and ranch) that I have had. The food was outstanding, wait time was very short, and the service was amazing! One of our burgers came out undercooked and the waitress insisted on taking it back and bringing out a brand new one. The new one was perfect! The servers checked up on us frequently and not once did WE have to ask for something. They usually knew exactly what and when we wanted it? Overall, an amazing experience and would come again. And again.and again."}
{"text":"Waited for 1hr and 40 mins. Checked on name and girl said we have two with the same name and party. Well the party they sat was after us. Was told we are setting up a table, it will be 6 more minutes. Over ten minutes later, the party we are waiting for hasn't left. Wtf? She got a manager and he wanted to slit us up. Wait, you're still taking walk ins and our table isn't ready? All of a sudden they push tables together to get us seated. Really? Horrible."}
{"text":"This is a great burger!  Was so surprised, expected it to be mostly paying for a famous name...but it was really good.  Try the euro burger, we shared the truffle fries....another suggestion for you.  Is a little pricy , but most places are in Vegas."}
{"text":"The seating priority is awful!  There were 2 of us and we waited longer than larger parties because they sit people who have more than 2 first.  When you look inside the restaurant, there's only a few 2 people seats where most tables are for groups of 4 (regular table).  Were told the wait for 2 is 20 minutes, ended up it was 40. This is the first I have ever seen any restaurant that has this kind of seating waitlist. Seating should be first come first serve, and if a 2 people party comes first, they should be seated at a 3 seater table or 4 seater table.  Guess this is the way for them to pack more guest and make more money.  Service is also super slow!  It took us 50 minutes to get our burger.  This is not a French dinner that we're having here.  It's a burger joint that I was planning on getting in, getting my burger and eat it and then leave in 50... Not wait for 50 to get burger.  This is no joke here... I look at the clock at 1:54 when I ordered and got my burger at 2:45...  I got the farm burger: Thank goodness the egg was cooked perfectly and paired well with the duck bacon.  It's basically a breakfast burger with good meat.  My burger came medium rare and came medium rare.  It's a good burger but not good enough to wait for 1.5 hours to get my burger.  As for my friend's burger though.... medium rare came medium well...    Oh, and the fries... the fries was thick cut like how I like it.  Again, it was good but not 1.5 hours good.      Tip: Come off time = weekdays, so you won't wait this long.  And, come with large parties because you get priority seating over small (2) tables."}
{"text":"Wow! We had the Hell's Kitchen Burger & Sweet Potato Fries, American Burger & Truffle Fries.  If you eat nothing else for the rest of your life make it the Sweet Potato Fries."}
{"text":"It was okay. I expected better from Gordon Ramsay. I got the chicken burger and it was okay. Not the best I've had. The sweet potato fries were great. Our waitress said it would take 30 minutes. I'm glad she told us before we ordered. The hot dogs are hilariously huge. If you order any hot dogs you'll get a laugh. I wish it was better. The one thing I didn't like was the outfits the waitress wore. It seemed demeaning...."}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of Gordon Ramsay for some time, so I was REALLY excited to be here. I was expecting to hear some yelling and feel a serious ambiance, but I got the opposite of that. :( haha jk.   Service: EXCELLENT. The hostesses were really nice and helpful. Everyone had a smile on their faces (even if they can't bend over due to their dresses being so short haha). Our server was an ecstatic man who was informative, helpful and (I have to add in) good looking. Anyways, best service I've ever gotten. He even warned us to not get too much since the burgers were pretty filling. One con was that the wait time for the food was pretty long, so prepare yourself.   Food:  Truffle Fries:  I really don't like truffle oil and I confirmed it eating this, but the fries were still good. Unique, fancy and well made. The fries weren't too crispy or too soggy, the perfect balance. I'd recommend if you want to try something different.  Brittania Burger (arugula, mango chutney, some kind of cheese and a bunch of awesomeness):  Delicious. It wasn't overly greasy like a lot of burger joints. I've been to so many where you get grease dripping from the fingers, not a pretty experience haha. The bun was so soft and cute. And the bite was a party in my mouth. After eating half of it, I got pretty full, but I also had a toffee pudding shake before it (which was really rich). I really recommend this burger if you like a battle between sugar and salt :)  Shake #1 (toffee pudding and.... Other amazing things haha):  Everything in it is homemade so it was pretty epic. I've got to add in that it is very rich. If you like shakes, I'd recommend it, but make sure you don't drink too much or you'll be too full to eat haha.   Overall, if you're looking for a place to eat at check this place out!"}
{"text":"So I always wanted to try a chef Ramsey restaurant since I only seen it on the television. (Such a tourist) We were able to get seated right away which was great because it was during lunch hours. We ordered the uber cheese burger and gooey fries. We split the burger, and we LOVE cheese. The burger was fantastic. I would come back for that burger and to try more burgers. Our gooey fries was topped with cheese, salami, egg and other jazz. It seemed amazing but it was alright. I probably would not order it again but the fries portion was pretty big. The service was decent."}
{"text":"Maybe it was the hype... Gordon Ramsay, ya know? but honestly, for the price, and \"hype. Was well below what was expected. The wait, was not so bad. Went at about 9-10pm on a wednesday the 28th of august. We waited maybe 20minutes, not bad IMHO.  We were seated next to the flaming bugr sign. While cool, they definately need to add something to cool that area down, it's a bit warm from the flames. Although, wasn't TERRIBLE. just not the most pleasant place to sit.   The wait inside. HOLY CRAP. slow service. For the most part, they're cooking HAMBURGERS. Just a hamburger, and some hotdogs. How long should this take? The menu isn't very big for entrees. Another waitress came by and saw the slight misery in my face while awaiting for our food. It was a good 30 minutes. and that is after the good 10 or so minutes of waiting to actually take our order.  The burger. Was pretty darn good. Not $15 good for a burger, but pretty darn good. I know that I'm not paying for a $15 burger, I'm paying to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. We opted for Onion Rings instead of the fries, excellent choice in my opinion. They were pretty darn delish. If I were to ever come here again, it'd be for that.   When complete, it took a while to receive our ticket. I believe our total time spent inside, was a tad over an hour and a half from being seated. Overall, food was good, ruined by long ass wait for anything."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever had.  Get the Farm burger (medium rare). Get the truffle fries. Get the ice cream. It is expensive but holy smokes this place is so good.  I'm pretty picky with my burgers, but BurGR really tops them all. The Farm burger is perfectly juicy with toppings and a bun that seems to get every ratio right. Truffle fries are crispy, and the aioli and homemade ketchup are to die for.  As a side note: I've eaten here on three different levels of drunkenness (including sober), and each time it has been breathtaking.  This is a must-visit every time my girlfriend and I are in Vegas. EVERY TIME."}
{"text":"My friend and I strolled in here on a Sunday night after our flight got canceled. Another night in Vegas isn't so bad, amiright?  Anyway, funny enough, we didn't order a burger. We shared the chicken wings, farro salad, and the truffle fries. Everything was great! But, I'm gonna try a burger next time."}
{"text":"I'm a hipster and know very little about Gordon Ramsey, but if you're looking for great burgers and excellent fries during your visit to Las Vegas then this is the place. Some places have to make their burgers huge and filed with everything for some taste. These are a fair size with flavor in every bite. The price is fair and what you would expect. The gooey fries were amazing and the egg on it gave it that last bit of umpff. The food did take a while to come out and it wasn't even a packed house. Items are also gluten free."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim. I arrived about 11:20 AM on a Tuesday. The place was less than 1/3 full, and I was seated immediately. Being solo, I went for the bar. The bartender was very attentive, my beer was cold, and he was quick to notice when I was getting near the bottom and asked if I wanted a refill. All in all, the service was excellent.  I ordered the Farm Burger (beef patty, duck breast bacon, cheddar, fried egg). I asked for it medium rare, and that's exactly how I got it. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had, and I've had quite a few. In the context of a celebrity chef restaurant at a major casino in Las Vegas, the price seemed right. Of course, once you get accustomed to paying $8 for a pint of beer, $15 for a burger seems almost reasonable.  I didn't order any of the sides because I usually get filled up by the burger alone, but I did see some orders of fries being carried by, and they looked good.  I've read other reviews here about poor service and badly-prepared food, but that wasn't my experience. If I'm ever in Vegas again, I plan to stop here and try the Hog Burger.  Two lessons I've learned about Vegas: 1) If you want to do something popular, see if you can do it before noon. Not as many people are awake before then; 2) If you're going someplace popular or trendy for dinner before a show, either allow a LOT of time, or go elsewhere."}
{"text":"WHYYY, GORDON, WHYYY. This place is set up to succeed...but doesn't in my books. I got the Hell's Kitchen burger and the presentation was excellent. The taste, not so much.The peppers were nice and spicy but the meat patty, which I got medium since they said the medium rare would be bloody and pink, was too cooked and made everything a bit dry. The bread also looked delicious with its cool sesame stuff but it was a bit spongey and the texture didn't help the burger. The burger was so lackluster that I began to eat it like it was steak..cutting it with a fork and a knife and it was a drag to finish it.  They have a cool modern way to look at drinks on ipads. I got the green gin tea and it was good but very very bitter. Their specialty cocktails are worth trying imo, though sharing might be best to try different options since they vary widely from one to the other.  The service was excellent and the server was very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I love burgers. Period. Cheeseburgers in particular are my favorite food in the world. I don't know why, but they are. I ear them everywhere I go. Now, I absolutely had to try this place.  I will say it has not disappointed me any one of the six times I have been.    I have made my way through the food menu...still working on the drinks.  As far as I am concerned there is not a bad one in the bunch.  The pairings are really fun to order...and quite good as well if you want to keep things simple.  Every appetizer I have had has been delicious.   Homemade condiments.  Just blown away.    Order anything, you will love it."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of Gordon Ramsay and I've always wanted to try out his food! My friends and I came around opening hours and we barely had a wait. There was a long line that formed after a period of time though.   Service was amazing as our server checked up on us often and kept great conversations with us. We also felt that the servers were all good looking!   We ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger, Gooey Fries, Truffle Fries, and Fury Wings. Everything was so good and SO FLAVORFUL. The burger patty was very juicy. The sauces they have for dipping was also delicious. Try their curry ketchup and chipotle sauce on the side with your burger or fries!   One of my friends exclaim it was one of the best burgers she has had in her lifetime. We now say that we understand Gordon Ramsay's standards and expectations for food. My group of friends were basically drooling over the food after our Vegas weekend was over and we cannot wait to come back in the near future!!"}
{"text":"FINALLY...I've experience the infamous GR's BurGR!  I really like this place - the layout, service, & food.  I ordered the Fish BurGR and freakin loved EVERY SINGLE BITE.  The guys I went with ordered the Duck Breast burger and the Hell's Kitchen burger and they had 0 complaints.  I also had the truffle fries which were really good too.  The menu is simple and I'm so glad they had a seafood option...although just one..but I'm not complaining!  Overall I enjoyed my experience here - the only negative is the wait to be seated and the wait for food.  It is way too long!  They try and make it easy by getting your # and calling you when your table is ready which is appreciated - but the wait for the delicious burger is excruciating."}
{"text":"Our experience being seated was so bad that we couldn't even enjoy the food when we finally got seated.  I've never been treated so rudely at a restaurant.  After being told that it would be a 30-40 minute wait for a table we find a place at the edge of the bar to stand and have a drink.  An hour later we are still at the bar watching patron after patron who arrived after us be seated.  We were very polite and asked several times about our table and others being seated.  We were told that they had a rule to give preference to parties of 2, we had 3 in our group.  After being spoken to rudely and dismissed by the hostess we finally asked for the manager after approximately 90 minutes.  She was accommodating, but not particularly friendly.  We were even more infuriated when we were shown to our table only to see 5 surrounding tables completely empty.  I guess they were happy to see us buying drinks at the bar and so they continued to ignore us.  We were so excited to eat at a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, no so anymore.  NEVER AGAIN Gordon."}
{"text":"Fun experience. Granted we only had cocktails and appetizer at the bar, but it was a very positive experience. Our bartender was friendly and super helpful suggesting drinks for us. We ordered the Jalapeño poppers and they were DELICIOUS. Sad we weren't hungry enough to order burgers. Next time!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to come here. After all it's the very strict Gordon Ramsey . Maybe I set the bar too high but I thought this was an ok burger , I had the Hell's Kitchen burger and my gf had the American. We split some fries because they were 8 dollars. My burger was ok. From the description I thought I was going to get a napalm death from grill me all or something along those lines. But what I got was a basic avocado burger with mild sauce on it :/ I'm sure they used premium ingredients and what not but the taste was bland and eh. The presentation was beautiful and the waitress was quick and nice but the burger fell flat . My girls friends was very eh as well. I thought maybe since it was more traditional it would be good, some thing I thought it lacked something and the sweet pickles didn't help. Also the fries were not that great either I didn't really want to finish them. I will say tho the ketchup that comes with them was good"}
{"text":"Have you ever enjoyed a meal so much you actually slow down to have more time to enjoy it. It happened to me while eating a delicious burger.  In summary, this is probably the best burger I have had in any restaurant. And I have tried many, many burgers.  It is very well balanced: The meat is flavorful but not overpowering. The bread does not dominate but complements. It was simply delicious. This was my second visit to BurGR. This time I tried the European.  BurGR is inside Planet Hollywood. The restaurant is beautiful. The wait service was top notch. There is a full menu of drinks and beer (of course), and many burger options.  You can't go wrong with burGR"}

{"text":"Did not realize that I had not reviewed this Gordon Ramsay restaurant yet.  Was reminded when I saw one of my friends check-in here.  Gordon Ramsay's BurGr is located inside Planet Hollywood.  Went here with family, and we were the first one's in line!  Got there 30 minutes ahead of the opening so we were sure to get a seat for our group of 7.  The hostess who greeted us said that she would save our spot if we wanted to walk around the casino awhile.  She was true to her word.  We got back there right on time, and she let us in ahead of everyone!  Very cool!  In fact, the service was good throughout our meal.  4 stars for the customer service.  The ambiance and decor was okay.  Only thing that I did not like was some of the smoke from the casino would make it over to our table.  Not a fan of second hand smoke.    The food was a bit better than average.  Nothing stood out to me.  Maybe the second hand smoke affected the burgers taste in a negative manner.  My American Burger was expensive, but tasty. Would not order it again because of the price.  For $13, I expect a burger to taste much better than a cheeseburger that I can buy in my hometown car wash for half the price.  Truffle Parmesan Fries left me feeling more satisfied than the burger.  I may return here in the future.  Based on my first experience here, I'd only try them again if there was no long wait.  30 minutes is too long to wait for an overpriced burger."}
{"text":"The hog burger is out of this world good and the parmesan truffle fries were also to die for.  The line looks long to get a table but it goes super fast. The staff was friendly and attentive and knowledgeable about the food. All in all great experience."}
{"text":"Our party of four did not have a long wait to be seated.  I love the atmosphere of this restaurant.  We started with Fury Chicken Wings and Onion Rings for appetizers.  Ordered the American burger add bacon, and the Uber cheeseburger. Get the Uber Cheeseburger\" with Truffle Parmesan Fries, my personal favorite. My burger was cooked perfectly medium well. I didn't think the prices were too extreme, considering it's Vegas and you're also paying for Gordon Ramsey's name on the menu.  The serving of fries could easily be split between two people. I would Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best Burger Experience I ever had!  Just imaging how Gordon's steaks will taste like..."}
{"text":"I am giving Burgr 3 stars, a 2 star deduction due to bad service. I order the yardbird burger, loved and enjoyed it hence the 3 stars. The waitress I believe named Natalie/Natalia tended to us. She dropped off the specialty drinks, beer, and wine menu that came on the iPad and gave us time to look at it. The server assistant came by with 2 glasses of water assuming we'd didn't want anything else to drink. What if I wanted a soda? She never came back to our table aside from me downing my water to get attention so I could ask for some ketchup, to ask if we wanted desserts, and to drop off our check. We waited a while for our check and when she dropped it off, she didn't even bother to ask if I wanted a to go box for my fries. I understand it was busy, but she tended to the other tables in her section more frequently than our table. Yes I am a college student and I'm on spring break, and I did look the part, but don't judge me based on that and decide I won't tip well. I'm a hostess/waitress I know tipping etiquette, I fricking work for Caesar's Entertainment Horseshoe Bossier City, an affiliated casino with Planet Hollywood, a company that prides on services, yet I did not get the same treatment. I won't be dining in in the future, and I will let my friends know that this place is not college student friendly."}
{"text":"Not the traditional Ramsay style restaurant, but the food is still amazing and the staff are still great! The Fury Wings are delicious, the Farm Burger is perfect, but the Sticky Toffee Pudding Push-pops were lacking. You've also got to try the Skinny Screw cocktail, very light and refreshing!  Sit at the counter for a little more attention and interaction with the restaurant and kitchen crew! Great fun and energetic atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent burger in the high end of the scale!   Was a bit skeptical to the whole \"Gordon Ramsay put his name on this place\" thing and thought that maybe the whole hype is more beause of the name then the actual food.   Was happy to see i was totally wrong! Ok, so part of the hype is because of GR himself but the quality and taste of the food is great anyway.   We started of with the jalepeno shooters wich was 6 awesome cheese/bacon filled jalepeno poppers with lots of punch. Great start not to be missed!   The pork belly \"pig bao buns\" wich was a kind of a slider in a pita looking bread was not as good. It was way too much carrots and the bread was doughy and way to thick. The pork belly was tender but that was about everything that was good with this starter. Sorry Gordon!    And for the finally i took the Hells Kitchen burget with some kind of cheese, avocado, jalepeno and oven roasted tomatoes. Medium grilled and it was perfect when it came out! Ordered a side of mayo since there where no sauce on the burger but the burger with condiments was so juicy and tasty i left all the mayo.    Im a true burger nerd that love to test both chain and upscale burger with fois gras and truffle but this is one of my top 3 burgers i have ever had.  The price? I think it was about 15 $ wich is less then a mediocre burger at Hard Rock Café or similar place where i come from. I think its a bargain even though its a little bit more then the usual burger chain."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  Very well seasoned, high quality ingredients, and the ingredients all work SO well together.    Open late, very nice inside, and reasonably priced.  I was highly suspicious of a Celebrity Chef's location as it typically doesn't go this well.  This does not disappoint - don't miss this one."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a delicious meal here at BurGR before seeing Ka. We both had the Chantrelle mushroom burger and sweet potato fries. This burger was the best I've had. The beef was so flavorful and perfectly seasoned. Just delicious."}
{"text":"Water refill response time is really good here.   Get curry ketchup! Put it on everything!  Seats for most of the tables are really low.. I didn't like the height but my friend pointed out that it allows for a better view of the burger! Haha  This place is pretty busy, and the food takes understandably long to come out.  I really enjoyed the Hell's Kitchen Burger.  The Farm Burger was a bit too heavy and lacked a sharp flavor (like the pesto from the Hell's Kitchen burger) to pair with the greasiness.  Gooey Fries - true to its name, they're super cheesy. So much so that you begin to wonder if the potato is the topping. Truffle fries were better! Sweet potato fries were good too if that's your thing.  Glad I came!"}
{"text":"Just OK.  The burger itself was delicious but for the price and the presentation, I was expecting a more substantial slab of meat.  It's basically mid-range quality with better quality toppings.    Burgers don't come with fries, but the fries are nowhere near the quality they should have been for having to buy them separately.  Too much salt, and the texture was disappointing.  The fries are served with two ketchups, Chipotle and Curry, but I didn't care for either. I was looking forward to dipping my fries in regular ketchup but they don't have that.    Overall, a resounding \"meh.\"  And what is Gordon Ramsey doing in that huge photo overlooking the dining room with his hands up and his mouth open?  I couldn't help but feel unsettled by this bizarre image staring at me while I'm eating..."}
{"text":"This place was quite disappointing! The check-in process was quite smooth, but after that, everything went straight down. We were greeted by a cheery maître d and manager, who took our name, party size, and phone number. Once our table was ready, they texted us, which was convenient. However, that's where the pleasantries ended. Our waitress was extremely rude and jumpy, she seemed only interested in having us order tons of food off the menu and kept pushing items. It turns out a family member of the waitress was sitting behind us, so our waitress was preoccupied tending to her. She barely checked on us and even forgot to bring a drink. The food was also pretty bland. Being a party of 6 we ordered a variety of entrees. The burgers weren't flavorful, fries over cooked, and the veggie burger was just a few pieces of unseasoned portobello mushrooms. At the end of service, we were asked to complete a survey, I hope someone reads my comments."}
{"text":"Awesome gourmets burgers. Service was on point. We had the hells kitchens burger and euro burger and they both were delicious! Regular fries were mediocre but we would still go back for the burgers! The wait at 1:30pm was 30 minute wait for two people. Not bad..."}
{"text":"Average wait time to get seated: 45 min (weekend, approx).  My group of 4 was lucky enough to bypass the LONG line and got seated right away. (Thank you Vegas gods! Lol)  A fun environment. The menu is fun to open with Gordon Ramsey's face on it.  Most items on the menu are a bit pricey (under $20 for a BURGER) but the food is delicious.  To be honest, the burgers were good but the APPETIZERS were AMAZING!!! (Better than the burgers, sorry!) Shout out to my favs: - Gooey fries - Beer battered Maui onion rings!!!  Would I come back here?  Probably not, but it's a place in Vegas where you HAVE to try at least once!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are very average. Overpriced. Go to Guy's restaurants for better burgers."}
{"text":"This was just amazing.  Unfortunately, we made the mistake of going to Mr. Ramsay's Pub and Grill and because it was beyond awful, we almost skipped this place.  So glad we didn't because it was the best meal we had our entire trip.  The shakes are hard to describe but are creamy, tasty, and unique.  Truffle burger, WOW.  Not one complaint from our party.  Elijah was attentive and friendly (unlike the staff at the Pub) and they are lucky to have him there."}
{"text":"It's a pity Burgr is a meh restaurant , because I'm a big fan of Gordon Ramsay.   Wait-time for a seat on a Friday Evening was 25mins. The food was a disappointing let-down.  I had the farm burger, what this 2-star review is based on.    The farm burger patty it self was under seasoned and tasteless. The duck bacon and aged cheddar was the highlight that help add some flavor to the bland burger.  I also tried the beer onion rings- just ok. The batter was not the best as bit cakey than crispy.  Service was sloooooowwwww, waited for a medium temperature burger for a good 30-40 mins -_-  My boyfriend had to give the waiter a \"really?\" face in order for him to proceed to the kitchen and follow up on our order.  All in all a disappointing $15 burger with Gordon's name on it.  Hope others have better luck.  As for me, I'll be at In and Out when in the west coast."}
{"text":"I was in vegas this past weekend and came here on New Years Eve since it was so difficult getting reservations anywhere! Unfortunately, this place does not take any reservations but since I am a platinum member with total rewards I didn't have to wait what so ever. I had the truffle burger made \"medium\" and I must say it was delicious! That word isn't even enough to describe how good it was! We also got the \"gooey fries\" and the \"truffle fries\". They were both very good but very filling. The waiters and waitresses were also very friendly and nice and gave some great selections on what beers to pick from. I ended up getting the innis gun since the waiter reccomended that with the burger and it went with it very well! I will be back here next time for sure. Maybe for lunch so we can try some of the more extravagant p[laces for dinner. P.S. Make reservations on New Years Eve if you would like to have some good food."}
{"text":"In the past couple of Vegas trips, I was bombarded with so many advertisements for Gordon Ramsay's new burger spot at Planet Hollywood that I had my heart set on checking this place out. I was so excited when our group decided to go, but my excitement turned to disappointment after my first bite of my burger. There are so many better burger spots in Vegas.  Food: 1) Hell's Kitchen Burger consists of roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, cheese, and oven roasted tomatoes. The patty was a bit overcooked than what I ordered and it was a bit dry. The first thing I noticed was that the bread was spongy, which threw me off. It just didn't go well with the burger overall. I think I would've rated the burger higher had a different bun been used. In addition, I can't justify paying $14 for that level and size of a burger without fries. 2 Stars** http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=wLuYs8aW3W1-xGoBhl1dKQ#JHKC0BPLK7zcydP_yMYlIg 2) Truffle Parmesan Fries were some of the best that I've tried. I could actually taste the truffle and there wasn't too much parmesan cheese that it masked the truffle flavor. 4 stars**** http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=wLuYs8aW3W1-xGoBhl1dKQ#-HoXHBgziWqfUPopOFdPVg 3) Roasted Jalapeno Poppers were simply top notch! I would have to say that this is one of the best Jalapeno poppers that I've had so far. The cheese was simply amazing and the exterior had just the right amount of crispiness. 5 Stars***** http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=wLuYs8aW3W1-xGoBhl1dKQ#iMTTzSQznYIMRsJueVsFlg 4) Fury Chicken Wings consists of 4 tangy hellfire blue cheese wings and 4 honey-wasabi wings. I really liked how the wings were very meaty pieces. However, the flavor was too tangy for my taste. The honey-wasabi wings were better, but I won't be ordering this again. 3 stars*** http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=wLuYs8aW3W1-xGoBhl1dKQ#xaNXVkPms8gHggUGj4GELg  Service: 4 Stars**** The hostesses were very friendly and efficient. The wait was over an hour and a half long, so we ordered to go. It was very convenient because after they took our order, they just texted us when the order was ready, which allowed us to gamble while we waited."}
{"text":"This was a perfect midday meal during a recent vaca to Vegas! They have a cool fire wall, a large photo of Gordon Ramsey being awesome, and the servers have GR embroidered jean pockets! Nice touch! Now for the food: A surprising craft beer list, truffle Parmesan fries, Hell's Kitchen burger, and the farm burger all made this a place we must stop whenever we are in town!"}
{"text":"THE BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!! I had the Brittannia Burgr which was delicious! I get my burgers Medium Well & of course it's usually a little dry, but this burger was still so juicy & tender! It was quite a pleasant surprise! The bun is so fluffy & made the burger even more pleasant to eat. My burger came with mango chutney & at first I was hesitant but it paired well. I also had the Just Fries which came with two dipping sauces which were unique.  The server was friendly & attentive. We were lucky enough to not have an hour plus long wait & were seated immediately. The ambiance is more casual than I thought it would be & it is clean.   I can't wait to come back & try everything I didn't get to try on the menu my first time here especially one of the milkshakes! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone especially burger lovers!"}
{"text":"The good thing about this place is that they're open late, why I'm eating dinner at almost midnight is a different topic.  The truffle fries were good, I like just about anything with truffle.  They have quite a variety of burgers.  I tried basically the All American burger, a tradition cheese burger, and the uber cheese burger.  The uber cheese burger had three different cheeses and was good, though the meat part of the burger could have been a bit more seasoned and larger; you don't want any bun only bites after all."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch, lots of TVs to watch the Football games.  It was opening weekend so you could tell everyone was a bit frantic but honestly service was fine.  Had the Euro burger with goat cheese and it was cooked to a nice medium.  The burger was a nice size, not too big but maybe slightly too small to share.  The truffle Parmesan fries were really good and a pretty large portion (easily share).  The sticky toffee pops were not my favorite.  I order the sticky toffee dessert at all of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants (including one in London) and honestly this version I just wasn't too keen on.  The peanut butter ice cream was the problem.  It seemed too salty, maybe with a caramel ice cream it would be better.  Overall not my favorite burger joint in Vegas (Bachi burger is the current winner) but if I was stuck on the strip I certainly wouldn't complain."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had. Ever. Well worth the wait! Wings were good but Hell's Kitchen burger was fan-freaking-tastic!"}
{"text":"This was everything I had hoped for and more!  Although my hubby would beg to differ, he ordered a fish sandwich at a burger place!  So he was disappointed, I, on the other hand, was not!  I ordered the Chanterelle burger YUM!  The atmosphere was great, service was expected for a popular Vegas place.  We started with onion rings...a must order!  We will visit again!"}
{"text":"Let me just say I was a huge fan before the menu / name changed. My farm house burger was incredibly dry as were my friends burgers, I asked for medium well it came RARE my friends medium rare came medium. The food literally took an hour and as I looked around the restaurant 90% of the tables had no food. This place is lacking after the name / menu change. Fix it Gordon."}
{"text":"went here about a month and a half ago... by fr the best burger I've had. the patty was super juicy and melted in your mouth with a nicely toasted bun. I got the hell's kitchen burger and it had just the perfect amount of heat. won't even think about going anywhere else next time I'm in vegas"}
{"text":"I tried this place because my sister's coworker recommended it.  The atmosphere is cool,but you might think you're at Hooters because the way the waitresses are dressed. I tried the Hell's Kitchen Burger,which seemed small for $15. The waitress did mention that the burgers were 7 ounces.  If you show your Total Rewards card,you get to save a dollar.  Unfortunately, I showed my card to one waitress then another waitress served my party's food."}
{"text":"Consider Me A Fan Sandwich  Overall:  Highly recommended. If you are seeking a tasty and satisfying burger look no further. I am skeptical of these restaurants who have big names attached to them but this one lives up to the hype. These burgers are satisfying and fulfilling without the crazy prices.  Parking:   Strip parking. Miracle Mile parking structure is not recommended on popular days it is usually pretty crowded but there is usually parking on the higher floors 8+. Taxi, valet or walk on over. *4 stars*  Establishment:   Vegas decor what you expect in Vegas. Service was attentive but not superb. *4 stars*  Food:   Gordon Burger: It was the special of the day so it is not on the menu. It was basically the Hog burger but remixed. It was so good and filling the most amazing burger I had to date. *5 stars*  Truffle fries: Holy cow were these good a bit cheesy but that would be a plus in my book. The dips were parmesan something and I believe some kind of ketchup did not catch the names. Both were enjoyable but not spectacular. *5 stars*"}
{"text":"I could hardly wait to return here for the pork burgr and gooey fries with cheese, more cheese and bacon! Service was prompt and server knew the menu well and made several suggestions with with a great smile. This is a really busy and popular place to eat."}
{"text":"Is the best burger around? Not really. I'm a die-hard burger fan. Loved the fries, they serve beer and I was able to eat outside and read a book. The staff isn't overwhelming, just the right amount of attention. The burger? I ordered the basic principal. I enjoyed it and will be back. Cheap? No. But the place is nice and did I mention they serve beer. I was quite content to chow down on my burger with good Sam Adams."}
{"text":"There's always a line for this place, so decided that we needed to try it out.  The burgers are decent, but nothing for me to rave about.  I tried the Farm Burgr, the Euro Burgr, and the Hell's Kitchen Burgr.  None of them stood out to be great, and all I remember was tasting some gaminess, which I'm not fond of.  Certainly does not compare to Bachi burger, in my opinion, but convenience-wise for being in the casino, I still give it 4 stars.  The line is the only thing that is inconvenient about it, but since there's a line, it must be good right?"}
{"text":"We were all impressed. Burgers were delicious and the fries were amazing....especially the truffle fries. Service was excellent, too."}
{"text":"First time here and very satisfied! It was definitely worth the 1 wait!!! You will not be disappointed!! I ordered the Hells kitchen burger with the spicy mayo... Omg to die for!!  The staff and service was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Most definitely the best burger I ever had, and why wouldn't it be?  The entire experience was awesome.  From the friendly staff to the atmosphere, and right down to the food I highly recommend trying Ramsey's BurGR.  Meal:  Hell's Kitchen Burger w/ Parmesan Truffle fries."}
