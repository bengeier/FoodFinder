{"text":"Ruby, Ruby, Ruby so good! That was my attempt at singin'.. I know, I know I'll stick to my day job! Ruby is a gigantic Chinese Restaurant on the corner of Finch and McCowan.  It's been around for a while, so it has definitely stood the test of time and proven it's a worthy restaurant.  

I used to come here every weekend with my family, it was kind of a tradition. We would go at the same time and order the exact same things every week, it never got old.. This place has the traditional cart system (where all food comes on carts and you pick and choose what you want).  I love the carts system, there's something exciting about seeing the carts coming and wondering what is on them. 

This place has great rice. It comes in either a clay pot or a small version in a stainless stain container.  it may not look too dazzling, but it tastes like a million bucks! They also have baked rice dishes (usually they come after 12PM), which look like casseroles. You can get a red sauce or a creamy white seafood sauce. Both are pretty good.  

Other than the rice, they have a lot of the traditional dim sum items. The carts makes their rounds fairly often, so if you missed the Har Gow, don't fret, it'll come around again.   The desserts are my favorite here. The lotus seed buns, the coconut pudding squares and egg tarts.  

Their aren't too many options for vegetarians so just be aware that the vegetarians will have to have eaten a little beforehand and just snack on the desserts!"}
{"text":"Great place for dim sum. Lots of food comes out and they have a lot specialties that come out at certain times, like they have fabulous egg tarts. 

Having dinner there is nothing special. Honestly, not great food but it'll get by. I do have super high standards as my father was a chef in a Chinese restaurant and makes superb food. 

Best times to go are for early morning dim sum, between 9:30am-11:30am, where prices are cheap as hell (usually $1.60/dish) or if that's too early lunch is always an option as well."}
{"text":"Great value and variety for dim sum. Just a bustle of Chinese folks enjoying their \"yum cha\" so if you're not used to this scene or the noise, be prepared. Bring along a Chinese friend and expect to be hassled by two or three little ol' Chinese ladies. Very popular for a reason. Good food at a great price. Traditional style with the carts and an extensive menu."}

{"text":"I have a bunch of friends who come here regularly for family dinners, and I know that every weekly in Toronto loves this place...but I'm not sold on Ruby.

Here's why:

1) Their food is good, but not great. There are so many places in this area where you can get super cheap Chinese food. I mean buckets of noodles and rice for under $10. Yet an average-sized dish here runs for $14? Based on what I've tasted, I'm not sure if it's worth it.

2) I went here ONCE for dim sum, and after waiting in line, got shoved in a corner where none of the carts came around. After trying to get a waiter's attention for 20 minutes (they kept walking by but diverting their eyes elsewhere), we just dealt with the fact that we only had 4 dishes between the two of us, and left. I almost didn't even want to pay, and I'm sure they wouldn't have noticed, since no one seemed to care that we were there in the first place.

3) This area is essentially uptown Chinatown, and there are a million better restaurants in the area. Dragon Dynasty at Huntingwood and Brimley has MUCH better food, a renowned chef, and a nicer interior. If you want a good meal out, I'd suggest going there for dim sum or otherwise. They're only a couple blocks away from each other anyway."}
