{"text":"Delicious! Fast, fun and friendly staff! This is a good place to spot in to for a quick, fresh and hot meal."}
{"text":"First time going and was pleasantly surprised. Food was great, place was clean and service was quick."}
{"text":"Our family of 3 ate at this store on a Mon. night about 5:30.We have eaten here many times before. We couldn't help but notice the prices have gone up and the service has gone down! No one ever came to check on us or offer refills on our drinks. I finally got the attention of one waitress by shaking my empty cup. It cost us  $31.00!  We usually tip at least 15%, but only left $1.00. No tip was earned. I do hope this is not a new trend. We will think twice before going back again."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff!! Came in 10 minutes before closing and went up to get a box, the manager told us not to rush and to take our time and eat. Very kind and yummy food too!!"}
{"text":"Great food! The service was great, and it was my first time eating at Showmars. When you walk in, instead of just getting a table, you walk up to the cash register and order your food. They have American (Burgers) and Greek food, too. The Onion RIngs were also great, too. Then you get seated at a table, and on Sundays, you don't get to sit where ever, because it is VERY crowded. Overall, Showmars at 521 is a GREAT place to eat."}
{"text":"Yummy! The onion rings were insanely delicious and the food was fresh to order. Their \"logo\" is \"Casual Dining...Fast!\" which sums it up perfectly. I will admit that I did not have high hopes for Showmars (I'm a natural skeptic) but the establishment proved to be enjoyable. I ordered one of the more popular menu items - The All-America Pita Burger and it was really good. Although, everything on the menu looked good. I was a little overwhelmed with being in a new place and all of the many seletions such as salads, platters, burgers, traditional greek favorites, etc. so I decided to play it somewhat safe. The staff was very attentive and patient with my indecisiveness. You order when you walk in and then sit down and a staff member brings the meal to you. Showmars seemed to have a fair amount of patrons and they all seemed to be repeat customers. Great place to eat!"}
{"text":"You know what? For what it is, this Showmars is top notch. A five star review doesn't = a five star restaurant experience of course, but if you want casual fast food in a clean environment, at a reasonable price and with polite staff, Showmars is the place to get it. 

The menu is interesting, a combination of casual Greek food, burgers and seafood. I've tried several of the Greek menu items, as well as the fish sandwich and the Calabash shrimp plate. Everything I've had has been top notch, but if I have to ding them for anything - and it's not enough to take off a star - they don't carry malt vinegar in the restaurant which seems a shame because that's all it would take for them to have a killer fish and chips meal!

My favorites are the crinkle cut fries, the hush puppies, their cole slaw, tzatziki and Greek salad. Every order I get fills at least one or two of those cravings.

Table runners are spot-on to refill drinks or get you anything you need. The only thing is I feel guilty about not leaving a cash tip, since there's no room to tip on a card at the register, and I go cashless almost 100% of the time. One of these days I'll pack a wad of singles into the console of my car so I can leave the table runners a buck or so for their fast and friendly service. As it is, I often sit close enough to the drink machine to grab my own refills and I self-buss my own mess. It's the former waitress in me coming out.

Good for singles, couples, families, lunch or dinner. Not a romantic joint, but doesn't try to pretend it is. You can even phone in an order and pick it up at their drive-thru window. Not much more you can ask for. Well, maybe a little malt vinegar..."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and service is truly the best I've experienced.  Our food showed up almost momentarily after we sat down.  The cheeseburger on a pita was excellent and my baked potato was nice and hot and came with butterflies and sour cream.  My sister's gyro was excellent as usual....that's what her favorite is, and she said that the Cole slaw was much better than most she's had.  We've been there before and we'll be there again and again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with the guys from work and we ordered a cheeseburgers.  Mine was dripping in grease the bun was hard as a rock and then 1 of the guys was like rubber and hard as a rock. I don't think we will be back again."}
{"text":"Hamburgers are very good and taste like homemade.  However, I love a good fish fry!  This is the place to go if you do too.  The flounder platter is excellent!  Flakey fish in a delicious batter.  Not at all greasy.  French fries are amazing!  Their coleslaw is also very good.  Free drink refills.  Family atmosphere and reasonable prices that won't break the bank.  You can also call ahead for take out at their drive through window."}
{"text":"Having been to several different Showmars around Charlotte, I have to say that this one is my favorite. I've never been disappointed with my food, and service has always been great."}
{"text":"the best restaurant I've ever been. (I was in 32 states of America.) great food. best service. wonderful people. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch because they are really quick with their service and bringing your food out. All the servers are very nice. 

I usually go with the pita burgers or the salad. But there's great variety and always a daily lunch special. 

Highly recommended. Also they have updated their decor which is a pleasant touch."}
{"text":"It's a typical showmars which is a good thing. They have great customer service and always ask if you need anything. The food is always good tasting but you need to watch what you eat. Not all of their food is exactly good for you. Prices are also quite low."}
{"text":"We love this Showmars! The food is always served fast, hot and fresh. The service is excellent. Portion sizes are great. Love everything we've had there."}
{"text":"Place is never clean.
The schwarma or gyro is much better at their South Park location or go to THe Arboretum to the Greek place there."}
{"text":"Short and simple. 
Good food, fast service and tasty.  Just a tad bit salty for my taste.   Overall, I will be a local going more often."}
{"text":"Great food. Pleasant people. The updated interior looks great! This is my favorite Showmars in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"Had never heard of Showmars until moving here so gave it a few visits.  Were amazed at the international flavor of the menu.  You can get Greek, Italian and good old American.  Plenty of options and easy to satisfy anyone.

A Peruvian runs the place and there are Latinos serving, so you can practice your Spanish while you munch on decent food. 

You order at the counter and they bring it to the table.  Service is fast and friendly for sure.  

Clean and rather large eating area and plenty of parking in front.

Motto:  Casual dining Fast  Yep."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat! I have eaten here since they opened up, and can honestly say that they have never let me down. This is the type of place that has made consistency a priority. The staff is always courteous, food is always good, the atmosphere can be whatever you are looking for, this truly is a place for everyone. 
My personal favorite is the All American Pita Burger, it wont let you down!"}
{"text":"Consistent quality.  That's it!  We can come here for a meal any time and we KNOW what we're going to get every time!  They have a good menu, limited though it may be compared to some other restaurants, but there is plenty of variety for the average family.  And, what they DO have, they do WELL.
Here's another thing - they don't mind subbing out the fries on their menu for other side options like veggies!  This is a big deal for me!
I recommend the fish sandwich first.  Very tasty and a nice serving of fish on the bun too! My kids like the Gyro and order it most of the time.  Now that they're getting older and increasing appetites, they're ordering the double pita burger sometimes too.  They love both!
We've always had really good service at this location.  The staff keeps moving around the restaurant frequently checking to see if you need anything.
So, this is a family place with lots of kids present.  Expect that.  You don't want to hear them, or be around them?  Keep travellin' on down the road.  For those who do have kids, they're grateful that there are places they can feel as comfortable as they do at home.
While we don't go anywhere every week, we are here regularly.  Great place, consistently."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Showmar's for fish tonight.  We ordered the flounder platter and Alaskan fish platter,  and a  hummus   salad . We asked the difference between the fish platters and was told The Alaskan fish was a thicker fish but also mild.
Service was quick and friendly. The place was clean and neat.
My flounder was delicious in a light non greasy coating. The Alaskan fish seemed to have a different coating for the batter, was a bit chewier than the flounder. We enjoyed the flounder better.
I did not want fries so a salad was easily substituted . Hush puppies and coleslaw came with the fish dinners and both were good. Coleslaw nice and creamy and hush puppies very tasty.
Our Mediterranean salad with hummus was okay. I have had better hummus elsewhere. Very lemony in taste with a slightly gritty mouth feel. The pita bread with it, soft and fresh. 
Food was served attractively with good portions, prices reasonable.
Staff attentive and checked our booth several times if we needed anything .
Showmar's has a kids menu and offers a variety of food such as burgers, salads, soups, chili, chicken tenders , gyros,   daily specials ,desserts as well as vegetarian choices.
Their mantra is southern, fresh, greek.
There is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Old meat! Got a gyro meat platter to go and the meat smelled funny when I got home with it.  I tasted just one small piece of it and almost gagged. Spat it out. WHAT ON EARTH!????? On top of it all, the little girl at the window had some sort of untreated (Trump like) anger issue she works out with the customers. GO TO GRECO INSTEAD!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's happened to Showmars.  I feel its a corporate shift away from quality.  Service and call in orders seems to be fine and working well. 

The food?  Showmars has raised it's prices, dramatically.  Fish and Shrimp dinner is now $12.40!  It was like $7.95.  We didn't get any more food than usual and frankly, it didn't taste good.  Nothing in the container was crispy and the shrimp is now so salty I couldn't eat it.  

2 dinners of fish and shrimp platters, with nothing extra not even a drink wad $28.00 including tax.  WTH Showmars?  I wouldn't mind if it was a delicious meal, but the food, at least the fish and shrimp has taken a downturn.

I won't be back....."}
{"text":"I love you Bella Ragone. She is the greatest worker ever and bless her soul. If she serves you consider yourself blessed forever!!"}
{"text":"it is ok for \"fast\" food. although they bring your meal to the table, service is hit or miss on if they check back. The food quantity is good, but taste is that of cafeteria food."}
{"text":"One  of  the  best  locations  they  have.
 Always  get  great  service and awesome food.!!!! One of the best  Fishsandwiches you can buy."}
{"text":"The food at Showars is always really good so I stopped here for a Greek salad with gyro. The restaurant itself is spacious and nice. I took my number and realized it had cheese on the underside from someone else's previous meal. Gross. It was about 2:45 on Tues afternoon so it was quiet and not many quests. I sat down near there large tv so I could have something to watch while I ate since I was actually waisting time.  The dinning room attendant brought me my food and when I showed her the cheese on the card she immediately cleaned it off and brought me a paper towel with sanitizer on it. 

I then asked her if she could change the station on the tv because it was on ESPN and I wasn't really interested in what was on. She said she didn't know she'd have to ask her manager. Fair enough. I asked if we could at least put on closed caption since it was a news program and I couldn't hear anything. I do understand about turning the volume up in a restaurant I agree because sometimes I don't want to hear somebody else watching TV while  I'm having a nice meal. 

When she returned she had another employee with her. She tried to turn up the volume but there was no sound. I said I wasn't interested and sound just the closed caption. Then they told me they didn't think the television had it. I explained to them all TVs now have close caption. I told them not to worry about it I just had wished I could at least know what they're saying on the television even though I didn't really care what was on. 

The dining room attendant returned again and informed me it was restaurant policy not to have sound on. I again told her I wasn't interested in hearing it I just wanted to be able to know what they were saying since it was a news show that was on, so if she could put on the closed caption that would be great.   She then told me that it was a restaurant television and it didn't have any sound or closed caption. That she was told that everything has been disabled.  I told her I didn't believe that was true that it should at least have closed caption but it wasn't that big of a deal I would sit there and try and read lips. Lol I don't understand why restaurants put big TVs in their restaurants and then don't put on closed caption. Beats me, but at least when I asked she at least tried even though she made up some cockamamie story and the more she talked the dumber she sounded.   No Manager ever came out to do anything with the TV.

I would come back just because it's Showmars and they have good food. This is actually not the Showmars I usually dine in anyway.  The Showmars  I go to actually has closed caption on the television. LOL"}
{"text":"We get take-out from here all the time, and dine in now and then.  They make a decent gyro.  I like the pita burgers, as I'm not a big bun fan.  I wish they had sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"The sweet tea.... Fabulous. I love going here for a quick meal that is good. Everything from seafood to a hamburger. The chicken pita is good and even the shell for the salad is good lol. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Showmars. Never been here, and will never return. The food was pretty dull and overpriced. Service was OK. They will nickle and dime you. I asked for yellow peppers and they wanted close to a dollar...There is nothing special about this generic tasting food. Ketchup tastes weird....

I would just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and I am very impressed. I ordered the three-piece flounder meal and it is outstanding. Place is very clean and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"It's just ok. I ordered the Greek salad in a tortilla and the tatsziki sauce is delicious. That's about it. The lettuce is regular iceberg. The tortilla bowl isn't fried enough and tasted old.  Place is just ok for a quick bite. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in late Thursday.  Had a double pita burger and fries.  Wife had chicken pita and greek salad.  Great friendly staff.  My food was good, however my wife ended up getting sick in the middle of the night from hers.  Thats why the low rating."}
{"text":"No one wanted to cook and we can always depend on Showmars. This trip was our first since the remodel and it's very, very nice inside. As always, we were greeted warmly and our food arrived quickly. Everything was as expected: shrimp/flounder combo, flounder dinner with an extra piece of flounder, fish sandwich (sense a theme?) and a kid's tender meal. All of our plates were left completely clean! With Showmars, you always know what to expect because they are consistent with their product and service."}
{"text":"Good food every time. Love the server Gabi! She is all over it every visit. Great smile and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Last time I was there I got a fish platter that was absolutely delightful. The fish was perfectly cooked not to try not to uncooked it was just perfect in the middle. Their coleslaw is some of the only coleslaw I will eat and there are other food that I've ever tasted has always been top notch. I've had a few different fish sandwiches and have never been disappointed.
 The service always is friendly and polite and the restaurant is kept very very clean."}
