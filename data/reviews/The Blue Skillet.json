{"text":"I came with family, 
My mother in law got the vegetarian omelette with fries and she loved it! The portion is huge! But very very good.

I got the the play with the steak ham and hash and eggs. W a side of sausage . The sides are BIG couldn't finish it. We got 3 sides of sausage and we usually do at ihop since smaller portions. Everything was very good.


Chocolate chip pancakes my son got. There kids menu to me is exspence. Almost $6 for the pancakes and additional charge for a side, unlike ihop you pay $5for kids plate including 2 sides. 

Everything was yummy !"}
{"text":"My first time trying it also, they had messed up the order twice. Food overall was alright as well, the pancakes also where not cooked all the way I could take the batter towards the center. Besides that it was ok."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst service i ever recieve the waitress laura, has no clue how to be a waitress...aruge with us the whole entire time...not once did she check on us...worst experience...overall food and service is horrible..."}
{"text":"Coffee that tastes like pepper? No, thanks! This is my second time at this Blueberry Hill. The first time they got the benefit of my doubt, but the second time sealed my doubts. The place looks run down. The food tasted like rubber, the eggs were half cooked, & pepper tasting coffee. Plus the cashier couldn't add $17.20 + what makes $20.00 even? The only positive is the server that helped us both times. She was sweet, positive, and helpful. She is a tall thin lady."}
{"text":"It's ok....Me and my wife came here for breakfast. We ordered 2 omelets, 2 cups of coffee and a side of pancakes + 3 dollar tip...We spent 40 bucks and the food wasn't the greatest. Pancakes were kind of cold. The waitress gave us good service...We just walked out of there feeling like it wasn't worth 40 bucks. ...We usually go to ihop or Dennys and spend 25 for basically the same thing."}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast the first weekend I moved here to Vegas (July 16-17 2016) & it was so good! I ordered a chicken omelet with hashbrowns & toast. Their hashbrows are the best, but their pancakes are to die for! They have such great taste & they are nice & fluffy too. I want to try their breakfast but their pancakes always get me. I have tried their fried chicken for breakfast & it is delicious along with the gravy. They open at 6 & close at 3 which sucks, but either way, their food is bomb!"}
{"text":"I have a horrible service From Ashley,
She just take the orden and never back to check to refil coffe or soda,I always have very nice coments from this restaurant ,but my experince is bad 
Sorry  :-( :-( I won't come back"}
{"text":"Today's experience was horrible they took almost an hour for my food to come out not happy at all the service was not the best either."}
{"text":"The food and customer service is amazing. Been coming here for 10 yrs it's a little old school but it makes you feel at home. Have their chilaquiles or on the sweeter side the pancakes are freshly homemade not from the instant box."}
{"text":"I've come to this location many of times. I love the food! & that's the only reason I keep coming back. The service is always slow or mediocre. The manager is never existent. One hostess always gives you attitude but the food always makes up for it."}
{"text":"Food was good. Horrible customer service. The waitress, who had no name badge, served other guest before serving us. Guest who came after us. Once she came to serve us she was very short and with an attitude. Took about 40-45 minutes until we got our food. Came once if we needed anything else. Other tables multiple times. First time ever I did not left a tip and I always do. No matter how the service is, but this waitress, she is Hispanic with glasses, was horrible in every way. Would not be coming back and will let others know to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service and food were great.  We are winter residents who search for new places to eat breakfast on Sunday. We were not disappointed.  Don't be discouraged by the location next to a somewhat dodgy-looking (my opinion) smoke shop because the restaurant is very clean inside and out.  The decor and ambiance are somewhat retro.  Not obviously set up to be a retro 50's diner, it is still reminiscent of that era.  When we arrived there, even late by our standards, there were only a few customers, and we were seated immediately.  Before we left the place was full, so it is popular, but maybe with a later crowd.  

The menus - kept at the table or booth - are professionally done with accurate photos and descriptions of the extensive choices available.  The wait staff was prompt, courteous and friendly and there was sufficient staff that there was very little waiting for service.  Food was served promptly with no more than the usual wait. Our coffee cups never got below half full. And the food was very good.  My wife had steak, eggs and pancakes and I had the meat lovers skillet; a revelry of cholesterol and calories.  Both were excellent fare, but we obviously didn't go there for a health food menu. Be sure to bring an healthy appetite because the portions served are beyond generous.   

The only knock is that the booths are not padded and they are connected back to back.  If the person sitting behind you is frigidity you are going to feel it.  Perhaps tightening the floor mountings would help.  

Overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times now the first time was a good experience fast sitting no wait for drinks and not a long wait for food. The second time not so good I went on 4th. of July and it wasn't busy at all maybe 5 or 6 tables with people and 4 waitresses. So services should of been fast so you would think. We order our sons food first being 4 he has a small attention span when it comes to restaurants and places a like. After we order him eggs and toast we were told the waitress would come back in a few to get my wife and I's order. Well a few minutes turned in to 15 -20 minutes. After all that wait time a completely different waitresses took our order because the first one didn't seem to enthused to be a work. Granted it was the 4th of July but it was the afternoon. I order the chicken parm sub was way over salted just not good was ok though. If I was you I would skip this and head somewhere else. Granted the food is good but service not so good."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fresh coffee, great service! I was made very happy by their chorizo skillet which you can order with warm corn tortillas to make your own breakfast tacos. Genius! I was just passing through but I would most assuredly visit again."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast in Vegas. I'm a local. It's greasy but the portions are great and the service is always A1"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place I've found here in Vegas. Every time my parents visit from out of state they always have to come here too. The food is amazing and I've always had great service."}
{"text":"Good breakfast - had a scrambled chorizo egg.  The place is very clean.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Don't eat here!!, ... this restaurant has roaches!! As they say, \"where there is one, there are tones\" Regretedly I spotted one AFTER I eat my food and then felt nausea.  I reported to the owner Romeoville DeLeon as he sat at the counter just texting away.  The roach was on its back waiting to die. I will NOT go back!!"}
{"text":"I've gone here as far back as I can remember. I love the staff and the faces that have been here for years. The meatloaf is a must have. I've never had meatloaf anywhere but here because they talked me into it and I crave it! Iced coffee now is good. Any place that has corned beef hash on the menu has my attention."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Blueberry Hill since I was very young. It's always been great. Our last visit to the Blue Skillet formally Blueberry Hill was the worst experience ever. My veggie omelet was dry, over cooked and tasteless. My husband's pancake was burned and our daughter's macaroni and cheese was soupy. I'm not sure what's happened since the name change, but it was awful."}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with all the low reviews. Came by here while on vacation with a group of six. We just fit into the largest table and once seated, proceed to have a grand diner experience. 

Service is impeccable. Very friendly. The food, even better. We each ordered something different and all raved about it. I had the Texas Chili Omelette and it could feed a small (or large) army. My son ordered a few pancakes and what came out could have also fed many. 

Going around the table, everyone was happy. If I lived in the area, I'd definitely become a regular here. 

I think they close between lunch and dinner. Around 3 pm the server/manager said she was preparing to close up but told us in no uncertain terms we were welcome to stay as long as we wished. No rush at all. 

It's a very casual, friendly, old-fashioned diner experience. Didn't try the coffee, but food was great. Hope to return soon. Might try lunch or dessert next time."}
{"text":"What a shame
Blue Skillet instead of Blueberry Hill
Maybe because the original team would be ashamed of them! 
One malicious person in the kitchen can cause a bad review!
They served the wrong meal by mistake , understandable. I ordered grilled not breaded and fried pork chops. No problem, I quietly waited no fuss no recriminations, just an error.
Until my \" pay back \" meal came. They had cut the chops to the tiniest most pathetic things you have ever seen. Not worth even tasting.
I paid for the toast and coffee and left. And I tipped the waitress well, she was embarrassed by what they had done.
Maybe this is why they have different name from before.
Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Truly a hidden gem. Wonderful food. Always polite staff and a full tummy everytime. I love this place. Happy dance!!! So glad we found this spot. Wayyy better than other breakfast places!!!! I gotta eat now!!! Yummie"}
{"text":"My husband and i had a great time here this morning. Our server Ash was fast and very friendly, she was also helpful with the menu. The food came out pretty fast too we were only at the restaurant for maybe 25 minutes. Both of us had a hash skillet with two eggs on top, everything was hot and the potatoes weren't overcooked like you find in a lot of breakfast places. All in all a good time."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall so at first glance doesnt look like much. Don't judge a book by its cover. What it lacks in eye appeal is made up by its Friendly staff and  quaint diner atmosphere. My favorite is the eggs benedict florentine. The coffee is divine and I love that they have flavored coffee - mate creamer.
Perfect place for a quick delicious bite and if you're not a location snob."}
{"text":"Country fried steak is great. Eggs cooked perfect and nice thick toasts. Greets service. Small booths are my only gripe"}
{"text":"This restaurant has recently changed its name from Blueberry Hill to The Blue Skillet.  The name might be different but the food is just as good.  My husband and I love coming to the Skillet for breakfast on the weekends.  It reminds us of the diners we used to love back home in the East.  My personal favorite is the chicken and waffles - it's soooo good!  The menu is massive - they have something for everyone.  Even picky eaters like me!  

The servers are always super friendly and most of the staff is bilingual (Spanish - just in case ya need it!).  If something is wrong with your order, they will fix it no questions asked.  It's the best breakfast/brunch spot in Northeast Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came in on Sunday at 1230. Helped right away! Very friendly wait staff! Food was absolutely delicious! I had grill cheese with tomato, husband had french toast that was delicious and our daughter had the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese stole the show! It was definitely homemade and best I have had!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!!! The pancakes and waffles can be topped with just about anything. The Dealer's Special has a little of everything. One of the best places in town to enjoy a belated birthday."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint that reminds me of waffle-house. Do not order anything that could be stored in the fridge as it tastes like it have ( huevos ranchos ). Massive omlettes that are worth the price."}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast spot! We love the food and the staff! They have great specials all the time and I love their fresh brewed coffee. Even when they are crowded the wait times are minimal. I am in love with their corned beef hash skillet. The pancakes are huge and delicious and come in a variety of flavors and with a variety of toppings."}
{"text":"Very friendly, good food and atmosphere. The coffee was meh, but I had decaf so I don't know if that makes a difference. Saturday mid morning very crowded. Also it's Mother's Day weekend."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE  I always  find myself coming back here whenever I want delicious French toast, good coffee, and good service. I have loved every single thing that I have ordered from this place. I always leave the restaurant very happy and warm inside. 10/10 definitely recommend"}
{"text":"This is such a great breakfast place! The food is always delicious and we never leave without a smile and our bellies full on good food!! We've been there a few time and we have received service from Ash and she's by far the BEST server there!!! Don't get me wrong their whole team is great but Ash is always attentive, makes sure my cup is always full with coffee and has the best customer service always with a smile. Ash always makes our trips there better. Trust me we drive across town just to eat there and having Ash there makes it much more worth it because now a Days is hard to find great service. Thank you Ash! Keep up the amazing job!"}
{"text":"Food was really good. But i would not come back, for the simple fact that they are so disorganized. Their customer service is horrible. We literally waited for someone to take our order for more than 15 mins. When someone finally took our order they got it wrong . We were so tired of waiting that we just left it like that. Also the waitress took forever to bring out a cup of orange juice that was ordered. She apperently forgot. Horrible service wont be coming back."}
{"text":"First off it is now called Blue Skillet Family Restaurant, which made it a little difficult to find as we were driving down the street. Once we figured it out, it was a great little place. Good food, good service, can't complain."}
{"text":"Great breakfast restaurant. We got the sampling platters ($10.99) that had a little bit of everything: pancakes/French toasts, smoked bacons, sausage, and hams, your kind of eggs, potato hash brown. The plates were filled up, very generous, long pieces of bacon which I loved, much better comparing to Denny's or IHOP. We ordered a special French toast with berries and whipped cream and it was delicious. We got a strawberry milkshake and the strawberry part is made with strawberry purée which was quite chunky, I could taste the real strawberry and I really appreciated that. The bill came up to $40 but we overdid it with the amount of food. It was great and we will come back again."}
{"text":"Service and food are great.  The omelets are huuuge!  Good to share.  I got the Philly cheesesteak omelet, the steak was delicious and the veggies were sautéed perfectly.  Fluffy eggs, perfect ratio of cheese, meat and veggies inside.  I came on a Tuesday morning, not busy at all.  Staff was very fast, friendly, and attentive.  I work in this area and all I see are chain restaurants- not much variety when I'd like to eat out.  So glad I found this spot!  I would definitely recommend it if you're looking for a great meal and value in this area.  Better quality ingredients than Denny's or IHOP.  Plenty of parking as well, in a large shopping center next to a Super K-Mart."}
{"text":"I Love Blue Skillet my fiancé and I have went several times I love the pancakes, 
I love that they give you a great amount of food..! 
I always have some food left for a midnight snack..!!"}
{"text":"So I've been here like 3 times and every time I have had a different experience. Today I went in there and order their Mexican Chilaquiles. They were really tasty until I found a hair in my food and made me sick to my stomach. Gladly our waitress was super sweet and took it off our tab. Overall this place is decent, I won't bash them over one piece of hair."}
{"text":"I normally order to go all the time and have had no issues. I love blueberry hills food, and let's be honest, this a blueberry hill location under a new name. However, from today on I will no longer be a patron. I called in to order like normal and there was no answer. I double checked that the number was correct and called again 5 different times with no answer. No worries, I guess they are busy... I called again a 6th time and was placed on a 15 min hold In which I finally just hung up. I decided to just go down to the location and make a to go order in person. I'm normally a pretty easy going person. I ordered a meal with some substitutions because all of their meals are very carb heavy and I am trying to cut back on my carb intake. The meal came with two sides of carbs that equals out to $4.98 a la Carte. I wanted a simple substitute of a side of bacon. The waitress had to go to the supposed manager 3 different times before coming back to tell me they could only substitute with more carbs. They have no idea that I was the one that called in and was put on hold for entirely to long, busy or not, that really is unacceptable and now I'm pissed. I let the waitress know this little fact and all I'm asking for is a small substitute that is a $1.79 less than the two sides of carbs. It wasn't the price I was worried about paying, the meal would've still cost the same and actually more because I was asking for other additional sides that the meal normally doesn't come with. It was the principle of a simple substitution that the supposed manager still couldn't accept. One item to replace two items. As a manager myself, I know these things can be done. Managers are supposed to help de-escalate a situation. Not make it worse. I wasn't asking for a free meal or to have certain things free, I was asking for a direct substitution that ultimately costs the company less. At that point they lost my patronage and I easily spend $100/month plus sometimes at their joint. I will gladly drive to a Real Blueberry Hill from now on."}
{"text":"Always a great place to have breakfast on the weekend. Service isn't always fast, but the food is great and the servers are always friendly. My favorite things are the omelettes and biscuits. A little pricey but always better than Denny's any day!"}
{"text":"Awesome food great music and nice overall atmosphere.  Every time I go here I love it, and even though they have changed names, they are still great.  My waitress was so nice and very friendly. Definitely a hidden treasure in vegas."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here this morning for the 1st time. Definitely a good meal. Waitress was good, but very busy & rushed. Had to ask for water refills & she forgot so had to ask again. Definitely better than IHOP or Dennys,  more of a country, home cooked vibe. It was crowded so get there early if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Yelp says:  Blueberry Hill Family restaurant...The sign on the business says:  Blue Skillet Family. Restaurant.  I went in to try the Chicken Fried Steak which I was hungry for.  The place appeared clean and was not busy.  The counter area had a sign saying it was closed and I was told by a busboy to set anywhere I'd like.  I picked a booth but the seat was so close to the table, I moved to another booth and it was even worse.  I am a big person (3XL) but had to sit in the corner table where there was a chair.  Like I said I'm big but the tables could have been smaller in the booths to make it comfortable.  My waitress came to wait on me immediately.  I asked if they had Chicken Fried Steaks, which they did but was hard to find on the menu ($11.99)  I ordered the CFS and asked if they had Texas Toast.  She had never heard of Texas Toast so I ordered the Sour Dough Toast.  The CFS came with two eggs, cooked the way I ordered them (Over Easy) and \"hash browns\" that were cut like the egg noodles you get with chicken and dumplings.  The potatoes were under cooked and tasted raw.  The sourdough toast was as hard as croutons, and not to my liking.  The CFS was not something I'd order again as it was the generic frozen kind and had no flavor whatsoever except for one bite in the middle, which I can't for the life of me, figure out why there was flavor in that one area.  The diet coke was $2.59.  The total was $15.00 for the meal and I tipped $2, which made my dinning experience $17.00 for a meal that I wouldn't be happy with even if it was half the price.  I did see other customers ordering sandwiches, that did look appetizing and thought maybe CFS just arn't what they are going to be noted for.  I don't like to give bad reviews, but I do think every meal should have something memorable to make you want to return, however, I did not get that experience during this encounter.  My advice is, good luck eating at the Blue Skillet."}
{"text":"I've eaten here, and the other locations, many times. I've never ordered the French toast until today. OMG, so good. It tastes like a cinnamon roll, but it's just Texas toast with their special batter. I know what I'm having for breakfast when I return. 
*this is now called the Blue Skillet, same good food!*"}
{"text":"Okay, this is for all the out of towners like me: This restaurant's sign reads \"Blue Skillet Pancake House\" and is directly next to the Big K-mart. The food is definitely worth any drive you make and you will Not leave hungry. My husband had the Ham and eggs and the ham is a huge seared-on-the-grill piece of meat. It took half the plate and he couldn't finish all his. The hash browns are wide-grated and not greasy at all. Crystal provided amazing service even though the place was hopping at 10am on a Wednesday. Thank you Yelpers for being right yet again!!! PS. The neighborhood is just fine!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. All this for 10.99. It's really outdated, but if you like the nostalgic feel, this place is for you. Everything was delicious, and service was great. However, my rating is because I was personally annoyed that for two drinks, one large tomato and one large OJ to be specific they charged us $7.99! I know all about having to increase pricing to make a profit, but come on! That's unreasonable. Also, the bacon was rock hard. My husband said you could tell it was made in an oven. Too bad since \"skillet\" is literally their name."}
{"text":"Recently located to Vegas wanted to try something different than ihop searched online and chose the blue skillet good atmosphere family oriented good food and customer service will be back"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good food, reasonable prices. 
I like supporting local businesses, I would prefer this place over an IHOP or Denny's any day. The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, but that's ok - you're here to eat breakfast during the day light. 
I can't wait to go back for the pancakes or try something from the large menu."}
{"text":"I've always loved breakfast here even when it was Blueberry Hill. It's still the same food just a different name. Nice homey restaurant with good food and GOOD coffee. One of the few good restaurants that remain on the east side of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Me and my very picky husband have been here three times and every time we have had great service and the best food in town."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try.  Hostess very friendly.  Busy but not big line.  We were a party of two, and a party of 7 came in behind us.  They asked if they could seat the large party while we waited for a smaller table to open.  Then they sat a party of 4 that had just barely arrived and completely ignored us.  We left.  I understand trying to maximize seating, but we will never go back."}
{"text":"This place can get really busy, but the service is usually fast and friendly.  They have daily specials and their coffee is good.  The menu is extensive from breakfast to lunch selections, American to South of the border.  If you're in the area, it's a place you may want to try.  Also, their name has changed to The Blue Skillet."}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint. I had the biscuits and gravy with sausage and it was great. Biscuits werent too heavy but stout enough to take the gravy and the gravy was a perfect consistency. 

Our server was also wonderful.  She checked our coffee every five minutes first time that has happened in a long time. Wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Omg. Just saw the worker at the register handle a puppy that her friend from off the streets brought in. I had to ask her was she going to wash her hands

But the food was good for now... Just hope it stays in

And the puppy was really really cute"}
{"text":"I think they deserve another star this time. I ordered for pick up this morning. Got the irish eggs benedict and the corned beef hash is on point! 

Also ordered chocolate chip pancake from the kids menu, and they were so smooth and fluffy compared to what I had before."}
{"text":"Excellent food in an old fashioned style diner. This one is hidden next to the KMart and a gem for a great big breakfast. 
The only negative is the scary guys who came in to steal the waitresses tips as we decided it was time to go. They really should've been kicked out. I loved the little old lady (customer) who chewed them out and took the tips back to give to the waitress. It's sad that such things happen nowadays! Maybe this plaza needs to hire some security!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the service is very good. The owner is amazing, she is very hands on with everything and interacts with her customers. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The place is very clean. The customer service is great. I don't wait a extremely long time for my food. This is my second time here and I most definitely will be back. This place is the first date, family day, and a Best Friend's hang out place"}
{"text":"Came here today ( Sunday) morning,  the place was packed, but these skilled employees  were on top of things, let me start by saying Ms. Donna treated us like family, she made us feel right at home. When it came time to take our order, she sat down across the table from us and acted like she had all the time in the world   to take our order, as busy as she was she did not rush us at all. Their fresh apple juice hit the spot for me, we ordered the bonanza special. It comes with 2 eggs anyway you like, bacon sausage or ham, and toast with hash browns or their yummy pancakes. Today I opted for bacon and hash browns and toast. The scrambled eggs were flavorful and cooked to perfection. The bacon was nice and crispy, and the hash browns were super yummy, and not too greasy. All for under $10.  My hubby got the double trouble burger, which comes with 2 huge, savory 1/4 lb beef patties, and homemade chilli. It comes with chili curly fries as well. My hubby is 6\"4 and can put away some food. Well he could only eat half. The beef was seasoned to perfection,  and the vegetables were crisp and fresh. I would definitely  recommend for your neighborhood  go-to. 

    Service was out of this world,  the food was great, and the employees work well under stress. I will definitely  be back to see Ms. Donna again."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning before it was even super busy. 
To keep it simple: 
Our server overcharged us on the bill, 

And I didn't get to catch her name but she was impolite the whole time and nobody ever refilled our drinks the entire time,

To top it off, she messed up my order! 
I'm not the type to return my order because I don't like wasting food considering the fact that I know they'll throw it away so I ended up eating it anyway.
But overall--- Eh. If you wanted to stay around the east side, it's better off going to Blueberry Hill or Ihop in my own opinion. 
Still love eggs though so there's 3 stars"}
{"text":"Great service. I had French toast which was delicious. My husband had chicken fried steak and eggs which he said was great. The menu had a huge breakfast selection and many items sounded very good. It is a very casual place but very good. I'll be back if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Service was excellent. Servers were attentive and very friendly. Menu had a great selection. I had a hard time choosing, but ended up with the meat lovers skillet. Food was good. Need to come back and sample some more food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast restaurant in town! They have a huge menu that fits any kind of person and their needs ( I would stick to the breakfast only though because that is what they do best!) The service is amazing, this is definitely a hole in the wall breakfast place that won't leave you feeling disappointed. It's not a high end restaurant, it's a home-y type place filled with people that are usually regulars and the food is delicious. If you're looking for a comfortable relaxed environment with delicious food, this place is it!! I have never had pancakes/ French toast that are as delicious as theirs are! Seriously. You'll forget all about your go-to breakfast chain place. The orange juice is also delicious, it's freshly squeezed and you can taste the difference."}
{"text":"If u are at this location ask for Felicia great service awesome server ;) the Mexican breakfasts are super delicious"}
{"text":"Where to start...... 

Service: Service was alright, Our Server just came up to us never asked us what we wanted to drink he just served us coffee, I guess ..... Thanks for asking.. I felt rushed when I was ordering my food like damn chill it's not that busy I kept asking for napkins and creamer for the coffee took him like  3 trips to finally bring them over. He never smiled btw.. 

Food: Food was worth the wait it was all good the Pancakes were fluffy, warm, and huge ! That blue berry sauce was good too everyone else enjoyed their food we had the chili burger as well it was good chili was a little on the dry side though but still good!"}
{"text":"Just left here and will not return. We spent over $50 in food that wasn't too good. 2 adults and 1 child. Service was okay. Just not worth the prices at all. We pay about the same at Grand Lux for what we ordered and never are disappointed with our meals. Tried someplace new. As I said, we just won't return. We like good food."}
{"text":"We love this place and everything in it. Great service, food is delicious and doesn't take too long. Nice environment."}
{"text":"New name: Blue Skillet Pancake House

Just paid $50 for breakfast, 2 kids and 2 adults! Be prepared to pay $2.50 for a cup of coffee and $3.00 for a small kids apple juice. Mushroom and cheese omelette was $10.50, came out over cooked and dry. Never again!"}
{"text":"While this is a locals place the prices tend to be on the level of an I-Hop although they do have some specials every day.  Food is decent most of the time, but you can find better food at cheaper prices elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food is really good. Seems fresh. Reasonable price. Waitress was sooooo classic diner waitress--- quick, nice and helpful. 

Diverse menu. Can accommodate large groups without notice--- dividers between booths go down!

Pancakes so fluffy.
Waffles ok.
Irish eggs Benedict is the best hangover/hungry meal!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times.  Our regular server was not here.  We sat for 20 minutes before WE had to ask to be served.  Of course the waiter was new and only had one other table that I could see.  
The young man seemed very confused to the menu items that we always order.  We had to show him the menu.  He was then gone and the other servers had to serve his other table.  Waiting...... Waiting........  The manager walked by two times and didn't say a word.    Waiting...... Waiting.......
Poor service today. Poor management."}
{"text":"The hours for Sunday is obviously wrong and they're closed. They're not opened at 6am. I've been calling for a pick up order for 15 minutes and no one answers. Either someone is late or they just open late *smh 
Denny's it is!"}
