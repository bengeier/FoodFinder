{"text":"Wonderful Italian food! I had gnocchi and it was delicious!  Very Italian atmosphere and service. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"You have to get the gnocchi gorgonzola...extremely soft and absolutely delicious. The portion size is very generous but leftovers are just not an option when they're that good! Owner was friendly but not intrusive."}
{"text":"This place is easily my favorite!..if not the the best fine dinning experience you will find in Bolton...I have personally worked for the Tony for several years in the past as a sue chef, and will always remember what ive learned there. He is always been the most hands on, hardest working owner you will ever meet and is very dedicated to the freshness of his food and how he keeps a clean workplace and tight ship. You might even catch him cutting the lawn still. This is a great italian environment for anyone .Strict but fair. as a former employee and a fan of the food...i highly recommend this place to anyone ..salute!"}
{"text":"This is a real Italian Restaurant. If you are not used to Italian culture, you have an excellent opportunity to learn how is to be served in an Italian way. Food is fantastic and is prepared right in front of you, since the kitchen is open. Service is slow as it should be, once you are eating Italian food and the Chef himself is attending you. It is already marked in my Notes as THE Italian restaurant in the north of GTA."}
{"text":"By far the best of the fine dining restaurants in Bolton.  Tony and his wife have run Allegro for a number of years in the Bolton valley, housed inside a building with his hand-painted art on the outer walls, and surrounded by the best patio in town.  Inside it's authentic Italy from the rustic design to the real Italian ingredients right to the wood-burning stove in the dining room.  The Gamberi Allegro appetizer is amazing; for dinner I go with the Fuoco D'artificio Linguine con Vongole or Fusilli con Pesto.  Always end with one of Tony's hand-drawn espresso shots, it's the perfect end to an evening at Allegro."}
{"text":"This restaurant is situated near the main square of downtown Bolton and is by far the best place to dine in all of Bolton.  If you need to impress a date, or a business associate, this is the place!  And surprisingly, you can do so on a budget if needed.  Soups are $6 and pizza's from their wood oven start at $10.  But there are fancy, more expensive, options as well.  I have been treated to this fine dining experience through business lunches and have favoured the seafood risotto with scallops and shrimp.  I have also been fortunate enough to devour a few of their steak dishes, which had me thinking it was truly one of the best steaks I had ever eaten.    Treat yourself to a wonderful lunch today!  Highly highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food was a 3.5 the atmosphere was a 2. The pizza crust was thin and the toppings fresh and flavourful! One of the best arugula and goat cheese salads I've had! YUM! The Gnocchi was like MUSH, it was barely even a solid... The place was dead on a Friday night, it was quiet and had very little ambiance. Our server was very nice and accommodating though. This place could benefit from a slightly more exciting menu and some aesthetic renovations."}
{"text":"When you're looking for an experience and a dish that has been created with care! You are looking for Allegro, it was a real treat!  Thank you Chef!  Zeke"}
