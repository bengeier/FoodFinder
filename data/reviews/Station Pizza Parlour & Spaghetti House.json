{"text":"Best sauce in town. Great local owners who have a personal relationship with customers.

I like spigetti with the works(mushroom & meatballs), my wife likes the ravioli. Go with the ceaser instead of the greek. I finally had the parmesian sandwich and it was great. Not a pizza guy but I'm told it's quite good...

A simple eat in experience where your there for the food and relaxed atmosphere.  Great place to go as you are!"}
{"text":"old owners are back .... newly renovated ...looks great !!! best pizza n ch parm we've
ever had !!! will b going back.... can't beat 30 years exp !!!"}
{"text":"Tried the pizza tonight and it was amazing! The dough was fluffy and tender and perfectly cooked and the sauce is absolutely amazing. I had a pepperoni pizza, my fianc√© had pepperoni, bacon, and green olives. We're both incredibly satisfied with our 'za. We can't wait to go back and try the pasta. 

Tom who took our order was awesome. Friendly, helpful and makes you feel at home!"}
{"text":"Food was really good and the service was friendly. A nice place to drop in when having a craving for some Italian food. Will try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Food has really improved since the new (old) owners have returned. Great pizza!"}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for years! Never disappointed. Highly recommend the Hawaiian pizza :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get food, whether you're sitting down or grabbing take-out. Their pizza is superior in quality to any franchise you can name, and they have Coke in glass bottles. (It's not just the material, the Coke in bottles is made with Cane Sugar, as opposed to glucose fructose.) There's no way I would ever go anywhere else for pizza if I'm nearby or even a 20-minute drive away."}
{"text":"We had a hard time getting to this place as there was a street festival on Markham meaning it took a lot longer than we wished. Traffic was frustrating but of course, this is not their fault and did not influence our score.

We ordered an 8 slice (13 inch) half-stationmaster/half-Mediterranean pizza and overpriced orange juice. Our bill plus tax and tip was $29.00.

This is important: the pizzas here are doughy. They don't have a hard crust but rather quite a fluffy one. Perhaps, this is what authentic Italian pizza tastes like but it is different than the western-type pizzas. Maybe, I could learn to like the doughy style, but I prefer the thin crust. So does my wife who did not like the dough at all and wanted to have it at home reheated in the toaster oven, hoping the crust would harden.

They did not have the 8 slice dough (13 inch pizza) we wanted so we had to pay more than we wish ($21.00) for the 10 slice (15 inch). Are you kidding me? Don't you just spin a blob of dough until you get the diameter you want? Obviously not.

The pizza tasted very fresh and not too oily (though that might just be perception and the box still had oil stains).

They tried to cram our 6 remaining slices in a 9 inch pizza box and it was just overflowing. This action did not impress.

The waitress was also slow getting back to us.

One of the people who worked there was quite loud and took away from the enjoyment of the experience a little.

The crowd was mostly Caucasian and maybe not many Asians eat there but I got the vibe that my wife and I did not get the same treatment as others, though to be fair I can't prove it and the lack of customer service might be for other reasons.

I saw the staff being super friendly to others. Maybe they were regulars or they went there a lot and deserve some extra attention, but I definitely didn't feel, \"welcome, we're so glad to have you, tell your friends about us, we'd love it if you come back.\" They were slightly more friendly than functional Hong Kong waitresses which is below average for a western-type restaurant.

We did reheat the pizza after and it tasted better than before but not any better than reheated pizza elsewhere.

This place is a lot more expensive than other places. The Station Master is 15 inch, has 6 toppings and was $21 at 15 inches. The equivalent Regino's pizza (the pizza place I most) is $17.41 and I enjoyed that a lot more and there are so many more locations to choose from.

The bottom line: given the price, lack of customer service, not very welcoming atmosphere, and doughy pizza, I would never come back.

3.0 stars. I feel like giving less, but I have to be objective.

My less objective wife gave it two stars."}
{"text":"Taken our kids there a few times, its been quiet, but the staff are fantastic and the pizzas are great"}
{"text":"Allergy friendly!  Homemade, delicious and the entire menu is peanut/tree nut free!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Markham over 3 years and I always noticed this place when I take the Go train, which is right across the street. Since I moved I noticed this place started getting more positive yelp reviews so I decided to give it try tonight. 

The food was decent. The pizza was the star because it was homemade but having been to NYC the pizza it doesn't blow me away. Definitely better than any of the take out places around this area. 4/5

The meatball hot sub was okay, but a bit one dimensional. 3/5

The spaghetti and meatball was not good. Small portions, the sauce was too acidic, and all store bought flavours. 1/5.

But my overall Yelp rating was based on how rude the old lady was to us, whom I presume is the owner. We came in at 6:06pm and was told we can sit at a table but there's a reservation there at 7pm. We accepted it because we didn't think leaving there by 7 would be a problem. So you would think because of this situation, they would help us along with giving us the menu and taking our orders promptly. Nope. I had to wave the servers to get both things. After we ordered around 6:16, they didn't serve us until 6:43pm leaving us 15 mins to eat. We were eating at a pretty good pace and I even decided to help them along by telling them I'll take care of the bill early, which the server was appreciative. At 6:50pm my kids both needed to use the bathroom so my wife took them. They were stopped by the old lady and told to hurry up because their 7:00 party was coming. By the time they came back out, we had all finished and taken care of the bill except for my kids. At 7:04 the old lady came by our table to ask \"if my kids are still going to eat\" while they both had food in their mouths. This is borderline harassment. We left the door at 7:08. 

Message to the owners: 
I understand you've probably been here a long time before all the new developments, and you were clearly saving that table for your regulars but just understand that new younger families are coming in and there a ton of new restaurants. There are choices. If you want continue your business, you may want to treat people with a little more respect and patience. I find it ironic that your generation complaint about millennials is our lack of patience."}
{"text":"After reading the ratings on yelp and in the neighbourhood paper, I was keen on trying the pizza here.  We ordered the all-meat pizza and it was good.  The sauce definitely tastes like it is homemade and it is not heavily spread on the pizza (which was good for one member of our party).  The pizza is thin crust.  Overall, it is a decent pizza, but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Had friends from out of town. Decided to go to station pizza for good food and service. It's a small place so we called ahead to let them know our party of six was coming. We called at 610 to no avail. We showed up at 630. We were served at 820.  Food was ok. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Y-U-M-M-Y! And this is coming from someone who doesn't really order pizza!

Came by for some pizza on a friends suggestion and it was definitely one of the best pizzas I've had in a long time. Crust was just right, toppings were gratuitous, and it was absolutely delicious. We ordered the Stationmaster and the Hawaiian Style, both with TONS of toppings and so good. They had this ranch dipping sauce as well, which seemed homemade, but we weren't alerted that there would be an additional cost for it... We ended up getting 2 when one would have been more than enough since we didn't know.

Service was really good overall, quick service, owner came to speak with us, and everything came out real quick.

Would definitely come back again when I'm in the mood for some za!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the pizza. Station master and meat lovers our my favorites.    Great family restaurant my kids like it  and the patios awesome."}
{"text":"We have recently discovered Station Pizza...old school pizza shop with attention and pride put into every meal. 

Tom and his staff greet everyone with a smile...kinda like eating at a relative's house!   Pizza is amazing...great crust....sauce...cheese and lots of delicious toppings !!! 

All the aforementioned comes with great value...best pizza shop in the GTA!!!!"}
{"text":"We were hungry for pizza and we didn't want to go a franchise place so we decided to try here.  The place is not too big but it is cosy.  We decided to have the Stationmaster pizza, their house special.  It was delicious, altough it did take a while for it to come to our table.  Would like to try some of their other items on the menu (it lookd delicious on other customers' tables)."}
{"text":"I got an email this morning from Yelp about Pizza vs Panzos in the burbs and Station Pizza was on the list. Since we don't live far we decided to give it a try tonight. We are always game to try new places. We ordered one Au Naturel and One Hawaiian Style.  The pizzas were great! The crust was nice and soft with a touch of chewiness. Just the way I like it. They were both cooked perfectly. I think we may have found our new favourite pizza joint. We will definitely be ordering again. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to others. Can't wait to try the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, but food quality wasnt great. Unfortunately for them, I rate food quality hire than service quality. Won't be coming here again. 

But they had lots of good reviews and recommendations, hence why we tried it. So you may still like it, although we didn't."}
{"text":"All the positive reviews were right - the pizza here is truly fantastic! Guess I can stop going to the Pizza Nova near my house from now on! We ordered the 12-slice Station Parlour Special (?) and switched out the green peppers with tomatoes instead - it came out hot and fresh and NOT greasy at all! The dough was crunch but still fluffy on the inside. Service was great as well - the students who work there part time showed really good customer service and manners. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I've never even had the pizza, I ordered the Italian sub and can't bring myself to order anything else. Best Italian sandwich in the city, blows subway and mr sub out of the water."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for pizza since I was wee little one and even after all the years, this place still consistently serves up some delicious pizza. 

Every time I walk in it's nostalgic. This place would host my hockey teams after our Sunday morning games. Memories I'll never forget! Just like the pizza!!!

Definitely worth a try if you have never had a chance to come here. It is hidden right in the corner of the plaza, just before the trains tracks, just after the LCBO on the right if you're going North on Markham Main."}
