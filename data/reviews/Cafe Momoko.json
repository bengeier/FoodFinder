{"text":"This place is tucked away in between cougar ridge and west springs and you would never know it's there.   The restaurant is tiny, less than 10 tables and has parking out front.   The server was great and really friendly. Was provided with complimentary house made potato chips which I thought was a bit strange.  The chips were a tad bit salty and oily, they were free so can't really complain.   Ordered one chicken and one beef hot plate donburi. Not the greatest way to serve this dish, the meat and vegs would be ok on the hot plate but not the rice and sauce as it literately burnt it. Eating crunchy rice is not appetizing and neither is having my sauce caramelize and burn.  The sauce was overly sweet as well and probably why it burnt so fast.   I don't know, torn about this place.  Thought the price was a little bit high for portions and overall quality. Extra scoop of rice would have made me feel better, unburnt crunchy rice that is."}
{"text":"Ordered sashimi plate, seaweed salad, miso soup.  all were prepared quickly, and tasted great - owner was serving that night and is very lively, has very good customer service - he gave us free tea, explained that he makes his own Korean hot /sweet/sour Sauce ( he calls it Moon sauce because he is Moon and he invented it) , and showed me that he prefers to mix the hot sauce with wasabi instead of traditional soy sauce - he politely asked if he could show me, then made it almost into a show for us -   A small cafe, Reasonably priced , Japanese And Korean food here - id come back :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love sushi! We had our first date and many since at Cafe Momoko! Moon the owner always aims to please and his sushi is hands down the best. There are also other wonderful menu options for the non-sushi lover.   I highly recommend checking out the restaurant as you will not regret it."}
{"text":"One of my favorites restaurants ever. The food is always high quality, delicious and quick. Moon is an attentive host and wants to make sure you are happy. Never had a bad experience here and could eat here every day easily. I'm torn between raving about the place and saving it for myself."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out last minute on a weekday night. It was empty as we were the only customers (I don't expect much on a weekday night). The food was good as we ordered Bulgolgi beef with rice and a spicy salmon roll combo. There was several side dishes like any Korean restaurant, but we fell in love with their kimchi! It tasted fresh and had a crunch to it compared to other places.It was pickled by the owner Moon, as he states he makes fresh batches everyday. We were also served by Moon who provided us excellent service along with his friendly and fun demeanor. The only sad part is we reside in the NE which is quite a drive to the SW."}
{"text":"Lovely. Had take-out and it was delicious. Never knew it was there but well worth a try. Service was quick and courteous. Will be back and recommend."}
{"text":"Hunting around on Yelp this evening at 5:50pm on a Friday for a place to eat that wasn't booked and found this little gem. Moon is super. And I genuinely mean this. I Love this guy. So genuine.  We had edamame and tempura to start which was tasty, but the real winner was the hot rock bibimbap and ginger honey tea. Throughly enjoyed both the food, and the dining experience."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Moon is great and remembers our names and the name of our daughter.   Food is really good as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best sushi and Japanese cuisine in town. The owner is great and has a very friendly and funny personality. You won't be disappointed with the quality and great taste. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is certainly an experience. The owner really does his best to make his customers as happy as possible. Such a nice and friendly guy. And he is quite some entertainer!  The food was just great! The pieces of sushi and rolls were huge and very good. The bimbimbap was yummy as well. And the first thing you get are homemade potato chips. I really like this place and I will go there again!  Make a reservation!! It's usually quite busy."}
{"text":"The best service! The owner is so cheerful and great to talk to. Food was also good. He also has his special \"moon sauce\" that he fed each of us . A great experience."}
{"text":"We went here lately for a quick dinner after passing by the NW, we ordered 2 ramen, hubby ordered beef and I ordered the chicken .Service is great, he's friendly and nice, we are served and looked upon ASAP .Broth for my soup is ok, but a little salty. I reckon they thought my order is also beef ramen since I see some beef meat on mine and topped with chicken as well. I don't know if that caused the salty broth . All in all,it is a wholesome experience. Next time, I might try their sushi rolls"}
{"text":"Excellent Japanese/Korean family-run restaurant - easily one of the best restaurant experiences that I've had in Calgary. The owner took such great care of my boyfriend and I the whole night! I had the Chicken Katsu which came with this delicious mustard dipping sauce (I don't normally like mustardy things) and sides of rice, corn, and salad. My boyfriend had a sushi platter with California roll, prawn tempura, and this spicy salmon roll. Everything tasted delicious and fresh, service was attentive and personable and we left with big smiles. I cannot say enough good things about this place and will definitely be back.   Verdict: Food: 4.5/5  Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5 (I'm in love with their cute interior/decor) Would I return: Definitely!! I would honestly pick this place over some fancy restaurant for a nice date."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants in Calgary! The food is delicious and fairly priced. The owner is amazing and definitely makes you feel at home in his quaint restaurant. Sure, it's out-of-the-way but it's totally worth the visit."}
{"text":"An excellent hidden gem. Great combination of sushi and Korean BBQ. A bit off the beaten path if you don't live in the area. But well worth sampling.   Never had a bad experience and the service is always fantastic. We tend to come early in the evening so it has never been busy while we've been there.   Try the special Momoko hot sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Caf√© Momoko is a neighborhood restaurant. So frankly it's pretty out of the way unless you live in the West Springs area in between Old Banff Coach Road and Bow Trail SW. If you find yourself in the hills one day, make the trek here. It's a cute little place with delicious food and the service is so welcoming.  I was first brought here by my boyfriend's family after they had purchased a Groupon or DealFind for this place. They had never been there either, but I guess the deal was amazing. They raved about the food after their visit, and insisted with join them the next time they went. The owner is Korean, and the food is a mix of Korean and Japanese. The menu has a mix of Korean BBQ, kimchi, and sushi on it. Order a mix. The sushi is basic, but delicious. It's simple, nothing fancy about the sushi rolls like you get with some bigger places downtown, but it's tasty, fresh made, and filling. The flavors work and it does the job. The Korean short ribs are also really delicious. They're sticky and smoky and flavorful. Match that with some kimchi and it all balances out nicely.   What we all liked the most about this place was the owner. His name escapes me right now, but I believe it's something like Muhn?  He's so friendly and attentive. He truly wants you to enjoy your visit and your meal. We've come back here twice after long absences, and he remembers us every time. He's extremely nice and welcoming.  I definitely recommend people in the area support this small operation. They do take-out, so you can pick up dinner on your way home as well."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise to find this adorable little cafe, a combination of Korean and Japanese food. The owner gives a lot of attention to detail and it is evident in the presentation of the food. He is also very social and will take the time to show you both the proper way of eating food in his culture and share some of his creativity i.e. Moon sauce."}
{"text":"Delicious, and the service was over the top wonderful! :) Highly suggest the bibimbap or the bulgogi lettuce wraps."}
{"text":"The owner really does make you feel like you are at home. Food was good, but the service is what keeps the people coming~~ you can tell Moon is dedicated to excellence service and delicious food. Although I am not from this area, I would highly recommend anyone to try this place out"}
{"text":"Utterly Awesome. Go there.. We recently discovered this small, friendly Japanese-Korean restaurant just minutes away from home. It's inside West Springs, just off Old Banff Coach Rd and down 73rd Street SW a couple of blocks in a small neighborhood plaza.  I could not be more pleased with this find. The menu included Japanese sushi & tempura, and Korean BBQ. The owner, Moon, is over the top grateful for your business, and is a wonderful executive chef.   You'll be happy you visited this wonderful little place. It only has about 20 seats. It's very busy on the weekend, so make a reservation. Early in the week, you won't need one, although it fills with loyal customers from the community very quickly.  You've got to eat here. Go now."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this spot for a while. The owner is such a welcoming host and the food was delicious. We ordered 2 rolls, LA galbi, spicy pork ramen and agedashi tofu. The food was fresh, generous and made with the homemade feel you can only get in a place like this. We will certainly be back again!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The owner, Moon, is very enthusiastic and does things a little differently. Ask for his Moon sauce. Momoko has a huge variety of menu options which might be surprising for a place in this location. The dumplings and tempura are particularly fantastic. Beef bulgogi is tender and flavourful. Some delicious giant rolls as well. Very unexpected high quality place, check it out! Lunch specials run all week."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The owner takes customer service to an entirely new level! He prepped his famous \"moon sauce\" for our aptly named Dynamite roll table side, brought us extra fixings for the super delicious beef bulgolgi, and when he learned of our two month long road trip even helped us clean our cars in cabin air filter after dinner!"}
{"text":"Wow, Wow, Wow! We just had our first experience at Cafe Momoko, and we will definitely return. My husband and I were treated like royalty, and the Korean bbq was excellent. This is a cozy, family-run business that appeared to be filled with regular customers. If you are looking for good food and like to be treated well, I highly recommend this restaurant. (Also, due to the limited number of tables, I would suggest calling ahead to make a reservation)."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Momoko for the first time on a recent Friday evening. Having lived nearby for over a year, I'm kicking myself for not visiting this wonderful Korean/Japanese restaurant sooner.  I walked in with my husband just before 6pm and we were lucky to get the last available table. With only 8-10 tables in the restaurant, the owner, Moon, handles all service. Moon is very friendly and clearly cares very much for this restaurant and his food, as he was quick to offer tips on Korean dining.   I had the Bulgogi beef which came with rice, a tempura yam slice, and sides of lettuce, bean sprout salad, slaw, and kimchi. The beef was flavourful and the sides (all homemade) made great accompaniments; the highlight for me, however, was the spicy/sweet/savory red sauce (sorry, don't know the name) also made in-house.  Looking around at other tables, the suchi rolls and ramen looked excellent. I look forward to trying more dishes in the future.  Given it was a Friday night, the restaurant was fairly busy with take-out orders in addition to the full dining room. With the owner handling all service, this did mean we had a bit of a wait to have our order taken. The owner apologized, though, and our food did come out quickly once our order was in."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you can already tell it's going to be good.  The owner is EXTREMELY friendly and caring and humble.  Food was great, bibimbap was delicious and tonkatsu bento box was plentiful and filling.  Definitely a must try if not just to support small business owners.  You can tell they work very hard and strive to please every single person that walks in."}
{"text":"We made the trip from downtown to dine here and it was totally worth it! Cute atmosphere, excellent Korean BBQ combo platter and sushi platter w very reasonable Monday special prices. HAPPY to give the owner our business, an awesome dude."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in Calgary!  It was a twice a month visit or more when I lived in Calgary. The owner, Moon, is greAt.  He learns your names and likes.  He and his wife have a great business in the West Springs/Cougar Ridge neighborhood.  If you order wine, he is very generous with his pour.  Love the fresh sushi and Moon will take the time to educate you on sushi, I was a new to sushi upon eating here.  I brought all my sushi friends here and they love it!  The sushi in Houston so far is not up to Moon's standards.  Moon also serves free homemade potato chips before the meal!  I miss this spot but will visit on my next Calgary trip!  Visit cafe Momoko and you will not be disappointed!  Thanks Moon will see you soon!"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times for take out.  Though the sushi menu isn't the most extensive I've seen it's excellent fair! I haven't had anything that's disappointed me yet. The service is outstanding, and the owner recognizes me every time and makes a point to ask how my last takeout order was.   Though its tucked into the 'burbs it's definitely worth a visit (even if it's just take out for a movie night!)"}
{"text":"Food was great, host/waiter was even better! He kept us entertained and informed about their little restaurant quirks (red moon sauce was really good!). We ordered from both their Korean menu and sushi menu, both of which were excellent. The restaurant itself was small, cozy, but still big enough for large groups. We saw a group of 10 sit comfortably together tucked away in a corner. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wonderful Korean BBQ with all the fixings and Moons' entertainment make this a great dining experience. We shared the sushi platter for one, Korean BBQ eel and bulgogi and it was all delicious. For us, the eel was the standout and not to be missed.  With a couple 'soju bombs' the meal came to less than $100. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is seriously sooo good! Very fresh and delicious Japanese and Korean food. Ugh the meat MELTS in your mouth. And the owner is very pleasant. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"5 star service for sure. The owner made sure we were nicely served by himself. The food was good but the service is definitely what keeps people coming back. Location has ample parking on the side since it's located near neighborhoods."}
{"text":"I have been here once. I went during a weekday for lunch and the food was good, but not impressive. The servings are big, their sushi rolls were on the larger side. Overall, decent experience. Nothing was bad but nothing was impressive as well. Service was prompt and very attentive. Place is spacious, and good for kids, families and big groups."}
{"text":"First restaurant I visited after coming from Ontario. Fish were fresh, chef was cordial, price was reasonable. I would gladly pick this place over much of Korean/Japanese restaurants that aren't in Toronto."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Owner is super friendly and makes you feel like home. Place is clean and tidy. Food is sooo tasty!!! Love it here would definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little Korean/Japanese cafe situated in the beautiful West Springs. The cafe is small, so seating is limited, but it wasn't overly busy during lunch time. The owner was also our server and seemed like he was running a one-man show! He was very efficient, polite and constantly had a smile on his face which made us feel very welcome, almost like we were in his own personal home! I love that he had small tvs inside the cafe playing K-POP videos and music, which I thought it added to the charm of this place.   I got Japanese, my girlfriend got Korean. I ordered the Momoko Special with miso soup and my girlfriend got the bi-bem-bop with beef. We munched on popcorn while our dishes were being prepared. Once they arrived, they were almost too pretty to eat the presentation was beautiful! The owner showed me a new way to eat sushi and mixed the house-made \"moon\" sauce with a little bit of wasabi and to use that instead of soy sauce. The combo was delicious and had a bit of a kick, but didn't have that overpowering wasabi taste that I'm not a huge fan of. I was super hungry and for some reason I didn't think the combo would've been enough, but the portion sizes are definitely on the bigger side and I ended up having to pack up the rest up. The dynamite roll is amazing and from what I'm told, it's apparently his signature roll. The roll with the moon sauce mixture was fantastic and my girlfriend just dumped so much of it on her bib-bam-bop as she said she couldn't get enough of it. I was also very happy with the miso soup, as there was lots of tofu bits as well as nori and green onion, which other places might skimp out on. My girlfriend loved her bi-bim-bop and was happy it came with a side of kimchi.   At the end, he gave us a old school kids lunch box to pick out candy from, which I thought was super cute. He told us to come back for dinner time and told us to call ahead as it can get busy. Will definitely be back to try out some more dishes!"}
{"text":"Cute little Japanese restaurant in the southwest, it is seemingly generic in its suburb location in a mini mall.     Stopped in for a quick lunch, they have some great lunch specials - many different bento box and sushi options all for very reasonable prices.   Lunch was very quiet, no one was there so we got lots of attention from the owner, who checked on us many times and was very enthusiastic and friendly.    He had us try his special \"moon\" sauce to have with our sushi, it was fantastic.  The highlights of the food were the gyoza vegetable dumplings - very tasty, the beef bulgogi - tender and flavourful, and the rolls were also delicious.     Will go back again for sure since it is close to our house."}
