{"text":"I am rating this restaurant a 5 star because of the quality and taste of the food.  The lunch buffet is priced right at $9.95.  The tandoori chicken brought out was fresh and moist as was the naan.  The butter chicken is one of the tastiest I have had and the salads were fresh.  There is enough variety to enjoy a few plates.  It is great for take out as well.  Small gem of Indian food in Thornhill."}
{"text":"We came here looking at the 4 star rating of the restaurant but we were quite disappointed. The quality of the food was not that great, the quantity for the price is not right and the service levels mediocre. If you want to see what the Indian restaurants in Canada looked like in 1980s or 1990s, then check this place out. Else, there are so Indian restaurants that offer better quality and service (and around the same price point)."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here tonight for my pre-birthday meal - which we do for each other annually.  The place is not very big, and the tables are a little close for comfort, but the food / variety is quite good, and the staff there are extremely accommodating.    Also - the Naan is the best I have ever had.  My only complaint with the place is the cleanliness. Surfaces are relatively clean, but It looks like the dining room and the kitchen haven't been THOROUGHLY cleaned for a long time - there is a dinginess to the place - especially with the walls.    I would love to see them give the restaurant a fresh coat of semi-gloss (NOT flat) latex paint, and get rid of some of the bric-a-brac that just collects dust and makes the place look cluttered."}
{"text":"The staff here is really nice. It's a small unassuming place but the food is delicious and they have a good selection for vegetarians.  They also do a take-out which is great for me because I work late and a sit down buffet is too much during the week.  You get a container for food and a container for salad stuff and a couple naan. You can fill it up plenty for one person with a big appetite.  We used to get take out at another place and that has good food but 2 naan and 2 dishes with a side of rice is $30 something. Here for $30 we get a bunch of dishes, 2 different kinds of rice, salad, 2 naan and we asked for a small side container and took a couple of those sweet dessert balls."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Indian cuisine. Came here for dinner and paid 15.99. Buffet comes with chili fish,  2 types of Tandoori chicken,  chicken vindaloo, butter chicken l,  chili fish and more.   The service is very good for an ayce. They gave us 1 order of garlic nhan for free."}
{"text":"One day a good friend of mine came over to spend an evening doing nothing. And nothing we did. Evidently, when doing as little as possible, you get very hungry.   He is practically a computer genius and always finds creative ways to order in rather than going outside to actually place an order. He asked me if liked Indian food of which I replied that I love it. He placed an order for lamb biryani, some naan, rice and a couple other things that elude me at the moment. All of which was placed on JustEat. Within about half an hour the meal arrived hot and the driver was very friendly.  Never having eaten biryani, I was slightly apprehensive that day to try new things. My apprehension was unwarranted. Never have I wanted to eat past the point where my vision was starting to go blurry until that meal.   I have been going there for the last three years and pretty much always get the butter chicken. Pick-up orders are discounted significantly which makes the trip there better.  The staff is a group of people that make me feel like Norm from Cheers.   Every batch of butter chicken is prepared from scratch on every order. This is perfect for me because my palate is sensitive and I enjoy how there are slight differences in the taste every time I go in.   You will not be making a bad decision dining or taking out with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tasteless doesn't taste like the original byriani. Samosas are horrible. Nothing even close to like back home"}
{"text":"Since many of us use the internet to hunt down a place to order from, it would be advantageous to state whether or not there is a range for delivery. I learned this tonight after speaking to a less than open to feedback driver or owner.   After I had been told delivery was available in my area, she asked me to speak to the driver, I said this should be posted on the website he let me know in a snotty tone that \"there are other indian resturants in my area\", \"we wouldn't drive there and back on a 20 twenty dollar order\" (which for the record it would be have been more).   Truly disappointing experience when a simple \"yes, we should look into that\" would have easily settled the conversation.   Looks like The Indian Cuisine would remember its manners or just continue to argue its self out of customers.."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the lunch buffet and thought that it was very good. I recommended to go there for dinner and it was absolutely amazing. It was the best Indian meal I have ever had. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We used Indian Cuisine to cater a small family event for 20 people and we were very happy with the service and food from start to end.   They were helpful and courteous and well priced for everything that was ordered.   All our guests enjoyed the food.    They provided complimentary naans and two salads with the order which was a nice surprise for us.  The Rasmalai desert was great.  The food was packaged really well and every dish was clearly labelled.   Nothing leaked or spilled en route.   We were very happy that the food was not greasy or oily which it can be for most Indian food.   The manager called us the next morning to follow up and  ensure that everything was alright and met our expectations.   Give this little place a try - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually just buy the chicken biryani here as it's close to my workplace and it's one of the things they do well, along with the mango Lassi. It's not perfect but it's one of the better ones I've tried in Toronto. The buffet looks just like any other Indian buffet place. Some of the buffets I've tried in Toronto seem to sweeten their dishes which drives me crazy but The Indian Cuisine thankfully doesn't seem to do that. Nothing to write home about but a good go-to in a pinch."}
{"text":"horrible customer service.  The washrooms are not clean either.  The food was okay, but the it very limited.  the Goat and Beef has more bones than meat!!    on top of they they are not happy with a 10% tip, they ASK for more!! I have never seen this before.  What a terrible place.  I don't know how come some people here have rated this place more than a 4 start."}
{"text":"Nice, non-greasy Indian food that is not too spicy for those who need less heat. There is hot sauce and chutney available to add heat.  Good selection of vegetarian and meat dishes in the buffet. The restaurant is small like a mom and pop establishment with a friendly and attentive owner.  And free parking to boot!! I'm going to try take out as well in the future."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Didnt expect such fresh and tasty food especially since it was empty when we got there. I will definitely go back when im craving good indian food. Loved the fresh golab balls."}
{"text":"What a surprise!  I've now ordered delivery twice and really love this 905 gem. Delivery was only a few minutes beyond the estimate provided.   The best dish was the Korma. It was sufficiently spicy with a velvet like texture. The Madras is also a recommend for those that really like it hot."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is amazing!! Best in the area for sure! The butter chicken is the best I've had in a while. Service is good, price is reasonable, love it!Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Mmm, filling.  Second time taking out from here, and was definitely pleased again.  Samosas and Bhajia appetizers, accompanied by coriander and tamarind sauces. The sauces were a little thin compared to what I am accustomed to, but they still were good.   Had four dishes shared for mains, Lamb Biryani, Butter Chicken, Chicken Korma and Mushroom Mutter Paneer.   All were plentiful, not lacking meat nor paneer. Surprising actually. Not to this place in particular, but an overall dining experience that  four adults and one child all could sample each dish, more than one morsel of meat each.  The chicken was moist and tender in the butter chicken, a good sign, not dried out leftover buffet scraps repurposed for the dish. Nice and fresh.   Only downsides I found were the Biryani lacked sultanas and the korma was a tad salty. Not the end of the world, but worth mentioning.   And finished with Mango Lassi, which were just right.  Yum, need to do the sit down buffet there one time."}
{"text":"Authentic, tasty and affordable Indian food. Restaurant is not fancy but  is clean and well maintained, and love that they have a buffet option. Staff are helpful and personable. Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"The Indian Cuisine is a great little spot in Thornhill to satisfy your Indian food cravings. I am of Indian decent and as such I've had exposure to amazing homemade Indian food both in Canada and back home and have also tried numerous fine Indian restaurants in the GTA such as The Host, Jaipur Grille, Bombay Bhel, Brar etc.   I can easily say that Indian Cuisine is on par with these other great restaurants if not better. Food tastes authentic and is not oily or greasy. When I open my take out container at other Indian restaurants there is usually a layer of oil on top of my food, but not here. Ingredients are fresh and good quality.   I've had take out, a la carte and the buffet and I can say the quality and taste is consistent throughout. Service is good also. The prices for a la carte are a bit high for Thornhill, but they usually have specials online if you check. Favourite dishes here are the Paneer Makhni (shai paneer), Palak Paneer and Mutter Panner. The naans are also amazing and cooked in an authentic tandoor. No fake pita type rip offs.   I will be back forsure!"}
{"text":"Is it the most delicious Indian food ever?  To be perfect honest, I'd have to say it's OK.  It's a small restaurant in a somewhat old shopping plaza, and I agree with the other reviews that it's a little bit dingy.  The best thing about Indian Cuisine for me is what you get for the price.  At $15 for an entire AYCE/buffet dinner, I think it's very reasonable.  There isn't a huge variety at the buffet cart, but there are at least 12 different dishes or so which range from the ever-popular butter chicken, fried cauliflower, lamb curry, goat curry, and spinach paneer.    The best dish is one which isn't in the line - it's unlimited, freshly baked naan brought to you from the kitchen.  Soft, warm, and with a lovely char marking/flavour, you can choose from regular or garlic naan.  I recommend the garlic naan.    Considering that the price of one dish at dinner will cost you about $12 anyway (without naan, which is an additional $1.50 or so), the buffet dinner is a good deal.  Though I wish in general the chefs would be a bit more generous with spices, I think you get what you pay for and the deal here is very fair."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here last night and we are super happy with the food, value, and service! The food came within (actually early) their estimated delivery time, and there was no charge for delivery. We ordered butter chicken, tandoori chicken, and the fried eggplant (vegetarian) -  great value and HUGE portion sizes. We were shocked! Also, most of their entrées, although already modestly priced for the huge portion size, include naan or rice with the order!   Highly recommend and will definitely order again for our next Indian fix."}
{"text":"Price and food quality is amazing!  Went there for the lunch buffet for $12.99 which is an awesome price.  Good variety, vegetarian, lamb, chicken and even fish!  Authentic taste!  Small place but excellent service.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Authentic Indian food. Their garlic naan bread is amazing!!! They make it fresh and deliver it to your table. (Instead of having it readily available at the Bedset) buffet pricing is also very affordable around $15-16 per person.  The buffet selection is not big but decent for what you are paying. The best was the meats. Lamb, chicken was good and the sauce was great with the naan bread. The tandoori chicken was really good too!!!   After eating such a meaty meal, they had very fresh watermelon and cantaloupe. They also have a selection of ice cream.  I also tried out their mango beer (cheetah) it was great! Especially with all the spicy food.  We came pretty early around 6pm on a Sunday. We were the first ones to arrive but it slowly got busy by 7pm. The buffet area is really small so it is best to come when it is less busy as there is no place to stand in that area.  The washrooms are not very clean. The sink is shared between male and females and also not very clean...   However the food was good so I would come here again."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place one night by chance and I have to say i have not received better service by a wait staff in years. The price is on par with most Indian buffets in the area. $9.99 for lunch and $13.99 for dinner. Their spread includes the usual fixings (butter chicken, masala, salad, cooked to order naan, rice pudding, tandoori, etc.) Their goat was especially delicious and their butter chicken was moist into the center which I look for whenever I have it.   No complaints about this place although not the most prominent easy finding location, their cozy family style ambiance and cheery staff made it a very pleasant dining experience.   I left a huge tip which I never do because I'm a cheapskate but they deserved every penny."}
{"text":"The food here is perfectly fine, but the dining experience must take both food and service into account. It is here that we encounter trouble. The server is disappointed when you order off the menu rather than grab your grub yourself from the buffet. One gets the impression that the objection is that it represents unwelcome work for the server.   Your server will not volunteer recommendations or advice, even if asked. He will only silently take your order. You will not be informed that rice is extra (!), and when you ask for an order, there will be no apology or any comment forthcoming, not a \"coming right up\" or anything of the sort. Your rice will be set silently on your table and your server will disappear.   You will not be asked if you enjoyed your food. You will not be asked if you would like tea afterwards.   For takeout, this place is fine. No service is expected anyway, so order away. For me, dining out demands a little extra. I'm not demanding much, just a little courtesy. Show me that you enjoy serving food to delighted customers, not that you appear to be working off the requirements of some kind of bizarre prison sentence. Dining out is a service business; show some passion and even delight for serving, or find a job that doesn't require such intense customer contact."}
{"text":"Seems to be a family run business, very welcoming. Enjoyed the buffet, definitely would come back for orders off the menu. The sampling was good and very attentive staff."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent taste. All at a great price. But what I enjoy the most is how homey this place is. The staff is super friendly and attentive. They chat with the customers and replenish your naan when you need it. I would definitely come back here if I was ever in the area."}
{"text":"Edit: came a 2nd time, and the quality didn't seem to match the 1st. The butter chicken just didn't taste that good at all. The only thing that I really ate was the mutton. Not sure if I'll return. Ps. they may have increased the prices... now $11.5 ($6 for kids)  Original review: Came here for the lunch buffet ($10). It was pretty dead (on a Friday)  Pretty decent variety of food including: Tandoori Butter chicken  Mutton curry  Beef curry  All of the above were good except the beef, which was pretty dry. The tandoori in particular was extremely good  Also has a wide variety of vegetables including eggplant which was delicious   Deserts include gulacham and ice cream (and fruit)   Kids under 3 free. 4yr olds are $5.  Plenty of free parking Takes credit card   Will def be back"}
{"text":"I returned recently, and this place is STILL a great value for the dollar, despite having slipped in quality since my last review."}
{"text":"Great local place for a very delicious AYCE Indian buffet. The price was also agreeable. I found that the staff were incredibly outgoing and great with checking in with your needs, always refilling your water and naan, but also courteous to ask before doing so. They have Bollywood clips playing on the TV, and to be honest, I'm so whitewashed that I could never stand watching them as a kid, but I found myself staring at the screen and... Enjoying it?! Hahaha.  Been back a few times and absolutely love the food. Coincendentally, a friend of mine recommended this place to me saying they loved the food, too. They didn't realize I had already been!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. We ordered from the menu instead of the buffet as we like particular items that weren't necessarily offered from the buffet. We also showed up for a late dinner and the food was not necessarily just made.  The service was incredibly slow. There are probably only 20 tables in the restaurant only which a quarter were occupied.   I wouldn't go back as it isn't in the local vicinity for me and was around the corner from where we were that day - there are better restaurants out there with better service."}
{"text":"Great butter chicken. Small place. Buffet line has the usual dishes. Tandoori chicken was very flavorful. Veg korma was also very tasty. I will visit again and recommend to friends and family."}
{"text":"The food, ambience and service are all very average. It's neither bad nor good.  I asked them to make it spicy yet it wasn't hot. The taste was just okay."}
{"text":"Good Indian buffet place in North York. The store front does not look like anything special and it's very simple inside, however the food tastes great and the service is great too!"}
{"text":"First time hitting up an Indian restaurant, decided to pick this cause it was near me. Did the all you can eat buffet pretty good giving it 4 stars because the butter chicken tasted pretty dry. Spent $16 after tax worth the price i'd say"}
{"text":"My first time here for lunch it was actually pretty good and reasonable price.   So this one is ayce Indian food lunch. They have a hot table on the side.4-5 selection of curries, tandoori chicken and some other Vege selection. Also, some dessert.  I actually tried everything and 80% of the food is pretty good and you could order naan that is include in the ayce price. I ordered a garlic naan it was not bad is just a little too thin on the naan. For 12.99 you can try a lot of varieties here.   Good place to give it a try if craving for Indian food.  Should try to make cheese naan."}
{"text":"It's your typical Indian buffet. Most of the dishes are what you normally see: tandoori chicken, butter chicken, tikka masala, curry goat, etc. Most of them were okay and nothing out of the ordinary. However, they had an eggplant dish (might just be seasonal), which was amazing.   The service was decent, the waiter came by to fill water often. The atmosphere was clean and quiet. This is a quick and easy option for those in the neighbourhood craving some Indian!"}
{"text":"Walked in for the lunch buffet. Place is not bike friendly as we had to lean the bikes against the window.  It's a shame no bike racks.  The buffet itself was not too bad, reminded me of The Cuisine of India that used to be near Empress Walk.  Not a huge selection, but had the right number of regular stuff you know will be at a restaurant like this.  The mango lassi price was a bit steep for the amount given, but it was alright.  For lunch, I'd say the price is pretty justified for an all you can eat lunch."}
{"text":"Ordered Butter Chicken, Naan and Goat Biryani from this joint.   The taste of Butter Chicken and Goat Biryani was utterly disappointed. Butter chicken was basically Tomato puree and chicken pieces were not fresh at all. Goat Biryani was stale."}
{"text":"We called ahead on a Sunday evening to book a table for 4.  By the time we got there, around 630pm, it was pretty empty, so that's good.  They have an a la carte menu or a buffet price.  We went with the buffet for $15 each. The buffet table spans about 20 different dishes (different types of curry, rice, desserts, veggies, salad bar).  Butter chicken, goat mutton, and the tandoori chicken stood out for me, as I kept going back for more.  They will also serve fresh naan bread (regular & garlic) to go with your buffet.  Overall, it's a nice restaurant and for the price, it's definitely worth your money."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner buffet and was very impressed. My main criteria is always just the food. There are too many pretentious places in the GTA. I've tried fancier Indian places and some of them had food that's worst than a buffet.   Anyways, for a buffet, the selection is excellent. For dinner, the meat dishes were fish, chicken shish kebobs, tandoori chicken, goat curry, lamb curry, butter chicken, and another type of curry chicken. They have various veggie dishes, including one with spinach and mushroom which I really liked. Things were fresh and were refilled in a timely manner. They serve freshly made naan delivered in a basket to your table.   Food quality is excellent. I felt like I was eating freshly made food. I know some buffets probably \"recycle\" their food for the next day. I don't think they do that here. Food is full of flavor. The only disappointment is the tandoori chicken which I found very lacking in flavor.   They have that ball thing for dessert and some ice cream. I guess their rice pudding and carrot pudding are like a dessert too. Good enough for me!  For their selection, $15.99 is a total steal, especially when you factor in their quality. I'm definitely coming here again next time I crave Indian and want to pig out."}
{"text":"I have been there for lunch and dinner both...But its the same menu for both times which i thought is odd coz i m paying more money for dinner for the exact same food...every week they offer one new item on their lunch buffet and a lot of times its things like pakora or vegetable pulao which in a traidtional indian restaurant should be on the menu at all times...naan always comes later than the curries...no point in that...  They have very limited options but the food is decent. and the venue is small but I like the coziness..and it looks like a legit nice restaurant..  Customer Service: I personally felt that I was not treated equally compared to some other customers that walked after me..i have gone there a few times and i have felt the same way everytime..I am not a big fan of the host that takes of care of the payments (older man with glasses) but I really like one of the waiters...very sweet and polite guy  I would recommend checking it out once because its a decent place with good food thats very affordable but I personally will not go back"}
{"text":"Meh. After reading high reviews my expectations were pretty high, so maybe that contributes to my disappointment.  Came at 7pm on a Saturday night, place was empty lol. Bad sign.   Ordered two dinner buffets. Not a huge selection. 5 meat curries, which is reasonable. But not much in terms of side appetizers and tandoori items.  Everything tasted bland, average. The spring rolls, chicken kebab thingy and tandoori chicken were particularly bad. Dry, tasteless, cardboardy.   The butter chicken is a 4/5, goat curry a 3/5, and the naan was fresh from a tandoori oven. So that's why this wasn't a complete 1 star.   The service was good and the owners seem like very nice people. Maybe my standards and expectations are just too high?"}
{"text":"Whether you are new to Indian cuisine or were born into it, The Indian Cuisine is definitely a must try. Although there's a menu, I would recommend first timers to try the buffet, which is impressive. It has a wide variety of dishes and is reasonably priced. Above all, the quality of the food served is far superior than what you normally get at a buffet. Furthermore, the fact that fresh nans are included in the price of the buffet makes this a really outstanding proposition. Even my wife who doesn't like Indian cuisine had a tremendous time with the lamb stews, which were delicious. The butter chicken was my personal favorite because of its creamy sauce and melt-in-your mouth texture.  The place is well light and clean, but it is rather small, which means that if you expect it to be busy, you probably should make a reservation, especially if you're going to be a lot. The staff was very friendly, jovial, and accommodating, making our time there a great experience.  Hence, I gave 5 stars because it manages to be the best Indian buffet in the neighborhood. It's certainly not the best Indian restaurant ever in Toronto, but it's not trying to get Michelin stars. It's trying to provide great and authentic dishes, and a family-type ambiance at an affordable price, and in this regard, it has passed with flying colors."}
{"text":"Dinner here is always $14.99. They don't discriminate the weekend :). When you are hungry and need a yummy cheap AYCE feast, come here, the price is a steal.  It is a very small restaurant but filled with lots of regulars who come here often. The family that runs this place is nice. They don't rush you even if you take your time eating plate after plate like me.  The food here is above average for an Indian buffet. I like that they have different curries available. Their selection cannot be compared to bigger buffets such as India's Taste in Markham or Dhaba / Kama / Aroma downtown."}
{"text":"Unbelievable. ..thus restaurant does not deserve any stars...I am forced to give it here even one how people gave this restaurant 5 stars and four stars....NEGATIVE . HORRIBLE and DISGUSTING experience...won't recommend it at all. .rice cold...and hard.... okra was sweet and cold...cold lamb curry and has so much smell you could vomit...butter chicken sour like cream has gone bad and looked like someone threw up and left it there...I am the last one to write reviews but guys please watch out for this one to top it all off....service was horrible...very argumentative waiter...I asked for lassi. .I got mango lassi I asked I want regular lassi I was told this is what I got for you.didnt feel like arguing. I tried to drink it was horrible and tasteless .food was cold...horrible ...and attitude of the waiter was completely messed up. I told him some food is really bad tasting ...I got snapped what do you expect out of buffet...that's how we serve. I was sitting on the end of the shop the waiter went inside the kitchen and I could hear him loud enough and clearly that he is telling the cook/owner what I am saying and what he snapped back and then started laughing ... I went to pay...I said listen I have eaten in other places and buffet is not always like this...I was trying to give you feedback...He goes I don't want your feedback. For $9.95 that's what you get. I then said I will put all this in reviews he said yeah that's why you came here. Our food is how it is... This is amazing. ..I seriously wonder how long this place will survive with this crappy food and service attitudes towards customers. .."}
{"text":"I used to love this buffet when I started coming here over a year ago, but I've noticed a decline quality in my last several visits.  The curries for the various meat dishes have become thin and watery and lacking of flavor.  The tawa which used to be the highlight of my earlier meals has become underwhelming.  There used to be much more variety in the buffet especially at dinner time, but now the buffet menu has become boring and repetitive.  Not sure if this is due to cost cutting or a different chef, but I no longer look forward to going to this buffet like I did in the earlier days.  What a shame!"}
{"text":"food was great, we had the buffet and I especially liked the butter chicken.  the deserts were made in the store and we're just right. owner was very nice and accommodating.  kheili chasbid!"}
{"text":"Have had many lunches and dinners in this restaurant since I live across the street.  This restaurant is fairly new and it needs it's reputation to be built, so I'm writing to ensure that people know it's a great meal, excellent service and reasonably priced.  Definitely worth trying.  By the way, most Indian restaurants don't have buffet dinners, so to have this restaurant offer this, is a great bonus.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So many things wrong with this place, they have a list of things on their website that are included in the buffet, at the restaurant we are told that those things are on the menu and not in the buffet. I had convinced my vegetarian friends based on things they said on their website. The chicken curry had stale overcooked meat, which they switched out as we were leaving. Overall the food was pretty bland and probably the worst indian I've had in the GTA"}
{"text":"Small but yummy all you can eat indian food buffet. The buffet, which costs $14.99 per person during dinner, is a much better price point than ordering a la carte (we calculated).  They had the usuals, from what I remember: goat curry, butter chicken, fish curry, chicken tandoori, vegetable curry, eggplant curry, coleslaw, rice pudding, regular and garlic naan. The place was pretty empty when we went so we didn't have to wait for a table. The food was a little cooler than expected, but still edible.   We went on a wednesday night so parking was plentiful."}
{"text":"Very tasty, fresh. How come just few ppl here? But they are really tasty. And the prices are really good as well. I recommend their buffet, totally worth it."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it was an excellent experience. We got plenty of attention from the wait staff. They were friendly and prompt. I ordered the butter chicken which was great, the naan was great. My dad order aloo gobi (i think that's what it's called) It was wonderful too. You can request for it to be extra spicy if you like. The food was fresh and aromatic just like they promised and the pakoras and samosas were crispy and very tasty! Recommend for sure, especially since it's one of the only one's in this area. =)"}
{"text":"The buffet is awesome. Tastes great. I didn't tried the biryani yet but my co-worker said its good.  Try the lamb or goat cury. Fricken awesome with nun.  The hot ghulab-jawan feels like heaven.  Too good to miss."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many Indian buffets but I expected there to be more selection from a buffet place. Surprisingly, there wasn't much to choose from (3-4 different meat dishes) and the taste was alright. The only highlight was the garlic naan!  The service was friendly though for a small restaurant. My nephews were also running around a bit and they accommodated that politely."}
{"text":"I hate to do this but the food was literally the worst Indian food. We ordered all chicken dishes for take out and the meal took 45min to make, which we thought was a good sign. However, once we starting to eat the chicken tasted awful and some pieces had tendons in it. It's very unfortunate since we were all starving and ate everything else, which was ok, and left all the chicken for the dog."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this quaint restaurant in Thornhill after hearing good reviews.   We walked in after the main lunch hours and the restutant had space for three. The buffet area was a nice three meter stretch alongside the wall. We ordered mango lassis, and instead of sweet mango lassi as I expected, it was fairly thick and a nice yogurt type of sour taste. It was a pleasant drink to show the authenticity of the restaurant.  The buffet dishes were flavourful for the most part. The goat curry, beef curry, and eggplant marsala were all delicious. As well, the naan served with the buffet was extremely delicious and complimented the flavours of the meal."}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.   Pleasant setting in a strip mall.  I had dinner buffet for $13,99 was tasty. Modest prices. Nice selection of meats and veggies. My wife ordered chicken off the menu for $9.99 and was happy. Service was good, but restaurant was not busy. Food took a little long to arrive, but I guess it was made to order.   Would return."}
{"text":"It's hard to go wrong with a $14.99 dinner buffet option. I came by on a weeknight. Excluding the dessert and appetizers, I remember counting about 6 vegetarian options and I think 4 meat options. Not bad at all. I also liked that they had both pakoras and samosas out on the buffet too. Perhaps most surprisingly, they also had noodles and spring rolls.... really? Hmm...  The naan is brought fresh to your table, both the standard and garlic flavours are offered. This was easily the highlight of the meal. Good stuff.  The only thing that was missing that I wish they'd had was saag.   They also had some desserts out. In addition to the standard Indian buffet dessert offerings, I appreciated the fruit they put out (watermelon, cantaloupe, and grapes -- possibly varies with season). Nothing special but at least something to refresh the palate after an intense Indian meal. They also had four ice cream flavours for you to choose from which was a nice touch.  Service was friendly and of standard courtesy. Wasn't too busy given that it was a weeknight but they had a good couple of tables there. Interestingly I noticed that they had some flyers that advertised \"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT!\" and that there was a lot of \"fresh, hygienic food.\" What do they mean by hygienic food? Was it not hygienic under the previous management? Am I the only person who finds it slightly disconcerting when a restaurant feels the need to advertise that it's under new management?  Oh well, bottom line is that I still enjoyed the meal and would come back if I was ever in the area looking for Indian."}
{"text":"Tried this on the basis of other Yelp! reviews.  It is not bad, though I would not give it a higher rating as the buffet is quite small and rather limited in selection.  The naan and vegetarian offerings were very good as was the butter chicken.  Tandoori chicken was a bit dry.  Raita was sweetened, but good.  The spinach and mushroom combination was a standout.  Only desserts are gulab jamun and ice cream - no rasmallai, gajar halva or rice pudding.  While the quality of cooking may be just a little higher here, I still prefer India's Taste (buffet is same price) due to the larger buffet selection.  Friendly and attentive service.  No ambience to speak of."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  I've been searching for an Indian restaurant in the Yonge/Finch/Steeles area for awhile, and stumbled upon this place on Yelp.  I came here for AYCE lunch ($12.99) on a Sunday afternoon. They serve lunch from 11am-3pm, and then dinner buffet/a la carte at 5pm for $14.99. The service was great, friendly, and attentive. The atmosphere is cozy, small, and very similar to most other Indian buffet restaurants out there.   The lunch included a variety of dishes, including chicken vindaloo, tandoori chicken, channa masala, saag paneer, butter chicken, goat curry, some eggplant dish, pakoras, basmati rice, dessert, ice cream, and a few other dishes. They also serve plain or garlic naan with the meal. All that for $12.99 was pretty good to me! I also ordered a mango lassi which was very creamy and delicious ($3.99 I believe).  All in all, a good place with a great variety of dishes to try. The butter chicken was a bit more on the tomatoey side, but it was still okay. However, for the price, the food was pretty decent. I'd come here again whenever i'm in the mood for Indian buffet! Another good thing is that they have a buffet at dinner time too, which not all places have."}
{"text":"Sorry...but I have to disagree with all of the positive reviews ! Saw that this was voted the best Indian in Thornhill, so we had to check it out. We had the buffet for $13 at dinner.Good deal and pretty good selection, but all of the food was COLD ! Not only was it unpleasant to eat room temperature/cold food, but this is also a concern from a food safety point of view.  We won't be back for mediocre food at best. The best Indian in Toronto is the Indian Kitchen just down the road at Yonge/Clark."}
{"text":"One of the best lamb vindaloo we've ever had. Perfect spicy and flavorful. The pilli pilli chicken exceptional. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is the most cozy and welcoming Indian restaurant for kilometers around!  We always go for the buffet and are never disappointed with the quality & variety of dishes on offer, including some original ones like fish curry.  also three kinds of cooked desserts and four kinds of ice cream including pistachio."}
{"text":"Excellent quiet uptown restaurant; Good tasty food;Extensive variety and the BEST chewiest naan I've tried; Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Just had the lunch buffet here and its really not worth it. The tandoori is all bones with hardly any meat, and the goat curry is watery and not very good, not too many other options other then that"}
{"text":"I came here on a saturday afternoon for the lunch buffet. It is 8.99+tax (everyday), how can you pass up on that?  I don't often eat Indian food but I thought this was a great way to be re-aquainted.The lunch buffet starts at 11:45pm and ends at around 3. Oddly enough it wasn't very busy. I suggest coming when they start so that the food is super fresh from the kitchen.   The variety of dishes are limited, but the food is good! There was biryani, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, salad area, lentil curry, squash curry, lamb curry, something with goat, gulab jamun (dessert), rice pudding. And I didn't find any of savoury items spicy at all - I always had the impression that Indian food is super spicy.   One thing I didn't like as much as I thought I would was their butter chicken. I thought it looked too red and tasted more like tandoori chicken. Maybe it's just me, I have really only eaten this dish a couple of times before. Also, I was expecting some more Indian sweets... like jelebi and rasgulla!  If there is one thing I really love here it would be their naan bread. It's soft yet crispy and warm and delicious. I want to come back just for the bread! Their biryani is also very delicious.  Service was also nice! My finished plates were always taken away and I always had refills to my glass of water."}
{"text":"Plenty of Indian buffets on yonge st closer to me and yet I am drawn to the acquired taste of my perception on Indian food... Their oven-baked flat bread aka naan/khamiri has to be fresh-CHECK! Butter chicken creamy and in a big BIG tray-CHECk!!! Spicy but not too spicy and a smaller buffet selection focusing on the taste factor, \"more naan my good sir, pls and tnx!!\" Comes out hot and fresh.    No fancy deco here, maroon colored table cloths brought me back to grandma's hosting of bingo nights. Plenty of food without minding the ambiance effect on guests. The food must be delicious enough to distract us from our surroundings though right? Winning!! Indian place and my Lola's place both get it.  The price here for the buffet is like winning (AGAIN) all those bingo jackpots plus all the butter chicken you want. Although the last time I was here, the kind server informed us that this particular buttery goodness was only served Fridays so do call ahead for assurance on this mind blowing cream dream before I'm blamed for disappointment."}
{"text":"Reading all the positive Yelp reviews this place was getting i had to check this place out, and i was not disappointed. For a 10.99 lunch buffet you get great tasting food and good value.  Driving about 35km to get to this place from where i live, i was hoping this place would live up to its Yelp reviews. I had friends also tagging along whom were skeptical about a indian buffet in a strip mall nestled between jewish and persian communities of the area.  Decor- this place was very unassuming. It really needs an update and reno to the decor, but that in turn might cause the prices to increase.  Service- it was an afternoon buffet, server was friendly and brought fresh naan to the table promptly . One of my pet peeves about buffets is when they DON'T clear plates quickly from the table, this place didn't have that problem.  Food- the buffet was fresh and food was tasty. This particular day they had a eggplant tawa... Yumm. Now keep in mind they don't have like 20 + items but for the price point what you get is well worth it.  Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"Love their biryani!!!! The individual that delivered our food walked up 2 flights of stairs while carrying about 10 biryanis. We really appreciated his effort and were extremely pleased with the food."}
{"text":"Overall experience was good. I'd say an average Indian restaurant. We were a group of 5 and had ordered Dal Makhani, Lamb Tawa, there was one more veggie dish, butter naans and rotis. I am not ruling this out of my list but just that won't be prioritizing it ahead of many other excellent choices around. They have pick-up, buffet options available as well. By the Vaughan Mill so parking is not a problem."}
{"text":"Quality of food/taste - 4 Ambiance - 3 Service - 1  Read reviews about this place and since I was in the area, decided to check it out. Didn't opt for the lunch buffet and ordered a la carte instead - Madras chicken (which I found had good flavour but not as spicy as the menu indicated), chicken lababdar (too sweet for my liking but if you're not a fan of spice, this would be a good dish to order), garlic naan and laccha paratha (both freshly made), gulab jamuns - strict ok : $1 each so didn't really care.   My peeves about this place : 1. When we entered there was such a cold reception, not a smile or acknowledgement from 4+ staff 2. We seated ourselves and weren't acknowledged for a while. I tried to pass it off like they were busy setting up their lunch buffet so would eventually come around. Nothing for 10 mins. Agitated I then asked for a menu to be brought to us.  3. There was a person taking photos of the place, I believe may be the owner - found him very fake. Completely different persona when talking to Caucasian patrons. He's Indian/Nepali- soooo shame!!!! While they might be your regular patrons in the area, if you don't treat other communities or new customers, expect to have a nose dive with your business. 4. When other customers walked in for the lunch buffet (read - Caucasian), there was so much hustle and bustle and enthusiastic smiles, channel was promptly changed to CP24 (we endured an hour of Nepali prayer procession music prior to this on TV) 5. Oh surprise -- treated very well when the bill came around, smh  6. Charge card machine defaulted with a comm error 4 times. The hostess decided she was going to try it and confirmed the tip amount thrice aloud as she insisted on keying it in, to the great amusement of the person I was having lunch with and patrons seated behind us. So very strange!!!   Anyway, if it wasn't for the food I would rate this place zero but the I can't blame the chefs there who are obviously doing a wonderful job with the food.   May return to try their lunch buffet without needing much from the 'service' factor."}
{"text":"Came here for the $14.99 dinner buffet. The buffet food tasted fresh and the naan (garlic and plain) was absolutely delicious. I particularly liked the paneer, butter chicken and goat curries. The mango lassi was good but a bit small for $4.99 and could have used some ice cubes. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. This is definitely a hidden gem in Thornhill. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Today we went to lunch buffet in Indian cuisine.  The buffet open at 11 am but we have to wait 10-15 more minute due to the food buffet is not ready.  The veg pokora and noodles taste is good  . Butter chicken need taste buttery ..I think to much tomato sauce. Chicken tandoori and fish pokora is need spice. Naan is so fresh and buttery taste ...is so good touch.  But the store need fresh up touch, look really outdated . Overall $12.99 /person it to much ."}
{"text":"After a long overnight shift, I found myself craving some Indian food but the problem was that I had to wait till noon to get some.  The wait was agonizing but oh boy the wait was worth it.  I came for the Indian Cuisine lunch buffet and the food tasted so awesome (came close to when they first open the restaurant).  I love their tandoori chicken, whenever you bite into it you can taste the marinade and spices.  Pair it with their Nan bread and mint sauce it is simply delicious.  I always get their Lassi and it is a good drink when eating spicy food ; it is nice and creamy.  Service wise the staff are great and consistent with drink refills; this was when a flash rush of 15 people came.  So it was nice to know I was not forgotten.  Overall, great place for lunch ($ 9.95) and I will definitely back when I'm around the area."}
{"text":"We went back to here for lunch buffet recently and it was a bit empty. Some of the food such as spring rolls were the leftover from last night and not crispy at all. I was a bit concern for other items too even though they tasted okay. I understand they didn't want to throw away the leftover items so I recommend not to go there too early. I guess if you show up after 7:30 pm at dinner, most of the food should be made at the same day."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, with friends for the lunch buffet, and perhaps once for dinner, also for the buffet. This time we came on a Tuesday night, and decided to skip the buffet and order a la carte. The rationale was that the food wood be fresher.  There were a handful of other patrons. It wasn't super busy, but it wasn't empty, either.  We ordered the lamb rogan josh, shahi paneer, peas pulao rice and naan. We were asked how spicy we wanted the food; and we replied hotter rather than mild.  The shahi paneer was delicious; very creamy and flavourful. The rice was colourful, but there could have been more, considering we had two main dishes. The portions of the main dishes were generous. The naan was better than all right, but not terrific. The big disappointment was the lamb. The meat was over-cooked and tough. The spice, however, was bang on.  The service was attentive, but not overly so. Our water glasses were kept full. However, they never asked us how everything was; so I had to broach the subject of the meat myself. The waiter mumbled something but I didn't catch it. Twice.  I probably wouldn't have bothered posting a review if it had ended there. But when I reviewed the bill I noticed the rice dish was charged at $4.99, and I was pretty sure It was less than that in the menu. Going to the cash I checked the menu, and sure enough, it was $3.49. I wanted to mention something, but after taking my money and giving me my change, he moved to the back and ignored me. He'd seen me checking the menu against the bill.  I decided not to wait further. I took the extra $1.50 out of his tip."}
{"text":"This place is beyond disappointing.   My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try after looking at the mixed yelp reviews. Perhaps, it's because we came here about an hour before it closed, but the food quality was definitely questionable.   We came here for the buffet and when we arrived it was completely empty, we sat ourselves since the waitress was on the phone. The food that was left out on the heat table looked like it's been left out for hours, and had developed a skin on top. Most of the selection looked like mush, it was the kind of quality that made you contemplate whether you're going to get food poisoning from it or not. We sat there hoping some other people will come into the restaurant, praying that we didn't make a mistake.  The flavors of most of the dishes that we tried tasted exactly the same. They were mildly seasoned, dried out, and had no flavor. This is saying a lot for a cuisine that is suppose to be packed with flavor. The one thing that I was most excited for was the butter chicken and it was not good. It was tough chicken in a watery tomato sauce. The only thing that was salvageable was the fresh garlic naan bread that was brought to the table. Everything else was beyond disappointing. I can't begin to understand where everyone elses positive reviews emerged from other than this being a cheap eat.  Overall impression: I would not try this place again and recommend most of you all to stay clear."}
{"text":"Very average food. Price was ok. Oddly they didn't have biryani in the buffet. Food was salty. Desert was good quality. Will not go back only because there was nothing special about the place."}
{"text":"Rated soley on the all you can eat lunch. Lunch is an amazing 9.99 dinner is 13.99. Ive been to a handful of indian buffets and this one is hands down the best in north york. Its easy to compare indian restauranta cause they all have the same thing.. Well almost lol. Savoury butter chicken and goat curry, tender and spicy tandoori chicken, and fresh naan. Its usually crispy instead of soft. Rice is fluffy and doesnt have nasty hard rice from being old loke some places. The honeydew (sometimes cantaloupe) is the sweetest ive had in years. Beef curry is a bit chewy but i just ignore that one. I guess they have some connections! Quality is there, for the size of the restaurant the food options are just right."}
