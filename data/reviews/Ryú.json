{"text":"Not friendly staff, sushi without flavor.
Ok to grab sthg before taking off if you dont want a sandwich"}
{"text":"We were just wandering around looking for something to eat and stumbled on this place, they've only been open for 5 weeks. The sushi was fresh, delicious, service was awesome. Tight space with not many seats so just watch for that if you've got a big party. We had the poke bowls and various nigiris."}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place.The food is affordable and delicious,the place is clean and the staff is always nice and respectful."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick sushi roll and a drink. Surprised how lite and good the food was.  Staff was nice and would really recommend going back."}
{"text":"My first time here. Clean restaurant. Prices are a bit high for what they give you. \"Pour emporter\" (to go) section prepared sushis way too cold to be enjoyed the way sushi should be eaten. I might be back to try their ramen soup or bahn-mi sandwiches, but not their sushis."}
{"text":"The quality of the fish is amazing. The tuna sashimi is even better than what we had in Japan. The salmon poke was also delicious, very flavorful and has a nice crunch to it. The restaurant itself is very cute and the waiters are friendly. The on drawback is that service is slow."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The place is small, so it's a little cramped. The employees were very friendly, especially our server, Mark."}
{"text":"Very nice new sushi place on Peel St. You can really taste the freshness of the fish! Super tasty! Cozy little place, only counter and a bench with small tables. So if you ask for a table for 2, you actually seat beside each other instead of in front. Nice service and nice ambiance!"}
{"text":"Loved it here.  We looked for a place to just sit and have a snack and a drink and stumbled upon this place.  The supreme framed logo made me already feel like they are in the know for urban culture and the sushi was top notch. 

Initially we came for a snack but I'm going to eat as much as I can before heading back to Alberta but I would highly recommend this place to any sushi lover."}
{"text":"Tuna poke and salmon tataki were good. Edamame was served cold which I didn't like. Food was good overall but was expensive for the quantity & quality."}
{"text":"I love eating at Japanese restaurants because of the atmosphere-a very clear, crisp look. This is the second location of Ryú in the Pierre Elliot Trudeau airport. They had a sushi and Poké bar. Pricea are on the high side ranging from 15$ and up. 
I ordered the spicy tuna Poké with avocado, cucumber, edamame, carrots, seaweed salad and caviar. Surprisingly there was no Quinoa available so I opted for the green salad as my base. I would've like spicy mayo because even the sauce wasn't enough. It was a bit spicy so I asked for less sauce. 

I support green restaurants. The highlight was the paper bowl that the Poké was served in. biodegradable is the way to go! 

Nothing beats good food and a view for takeoff!"}
{"text":"Friendly and delicious! Fish is fresh and prices are reasonable. Easy to walk to and service was fast. Would definitely come back again. Came here on a Monday night around 8 and there was a good small crowd."}
{"text":"Good, quick sushi. There's to-go meals as well as made-to-order poke and green juice options. Snacks include cold tea, edamame chips, pocky, and more snacks. I don't think there's regular hours? The cashier had closed the register when I wanted to buy grab-and-go sushi, but she reopened the register for my credit card. She was very friendly and when I asked if they closed at 7 (it was 6:50 pm) said that the restaurant wouldn't want to pay her if she was doing nothing and it was getting slow so she was closing down."}
{"text":"After a tiring trip, what a nice place to come here and relax to enjoy some fresh sushi offering.  I have passed by here a couple times and I have not been disappointed by the food.  Delicious and filling salmon and tuna sushi rolls.  They also carry fresh spring rolls, edamame and rice noodle dishes.  All of these are ready to go but you can also eat it in their cute and compact dining area.  I am not a fan of pubs or Tim Horton's so when I am travelling it is nice to get something a little different and refreshing.  Thank you Tatami."}
{"text":"YUL has a Montreal Canadiens restaurant.  Did this used to be Moes because the foot print looked familiar.  While YUL in the domestic area has a decent amount of places to eat the variety only stretches so far.  I mean sandwiches, burgers, coffee, bagels etc and while you get a lot of the same just about everywhere it's nice to see a place like Ryu to change things up a bit.  

Ryu has a variety of ready made maki and nigiri combos like you may see at grocery stores packed up and ready to go.  This would be helpful if you didn't want to eat on the plane or if you wanted to take it to go.  They do have a decent sized dine in area as well if you felt you wanted to eat in.  I ended up getting one of the maki and nigiri sushi combos and my wife ended up getting some sort of poke bowl but instead of rice she went with quinoa as the base filler.  I have to say after a week of eating out in the US almost every meal this was a nice treat.  We only had Asian cuisine once down there and I was sort of craving something with rice.

The combo was a mix of salmon and tuna (total 13 pieces) and it was almost 18 bucks.  While that seemed rather high I have to remember that we're at the airport and this food isn't fast food.  My wife's poke bowl was a mix of carrots, cucumbers, edamame, wakame and tuna.  The fish didn't looked marinated like Hawaiian poke or at least what we're used to at our regular poke place in Toronto but rather cut up tuna instead.  Still, it was good as I ended up finishing it because my wife couldn't.  I'm not normally big on quinoa but it went will with this bowl and it seemed to be actually filling.

The food was good but seemed rather pricey.  We've had better poke than this.  IMO you can't really call it poke unless the fish is marinated.  This place didn't even drizzle anything on it...?  Still it's decent and a switch from what every other place serves in the terminal."}
{"text":"Sushi, poke bowls and smoothies at the airport.  Located next to gate 50.  I had the classic Hawaiian poke bowl, it was just ok. A bit bland but ingredients were fresh.  Service was quick and polite.  Not a bad option if you want to grab something healthy at the airport."}
{"text":"A tiny sushi spot in downtown beautiful inside though. 

Service pretty slow from the preparing part. The waiter was very amiable but when asked question about portion or recommendation, he seemed clueless. 

I got the California Maki; it's very small portion. I did ask the waiter about portion and if it would enough for lunch. He said he thinks so; I guess he thought I was too big, I must not eat too much... . The dish was good but not enough; and I didn't feel to order more since the prep time takes so long (30 minutes for my tiny dish). My dish came about 20$ (tax and tips included), which was very steep. 

After I left, I just picked a latte to fill the rest of of my hunger."}
{"text":"Ryú on Peel has now been open for 8 weeks, and its business seems to be booming.
This location is a more upscale version of its stores at Carrefour Laval or the airport. No more siracha bottles on the tables or sushi burritos on the menu! The place can accomodate about 20 guests at a time, which is reasonable considering that they only have two employees working the room and two chefs behind the counter. The place is small, but clean and modern, with pale wooden tables and well-placed faux plants. The logo of the restaurant, which is also its name, represents the kanji for \"dragon\" - it shines over the patrons, basking the room in a gentle red neon light. The framed logo of Supreme is on a wall, and select 90's pop and hip hop hits are playing.

We liked the restaurant as soon as we walked in. The head waiter, whose witty professionalism was inflaillible throughout the evening, welcomed us. We chose to sit at the benches by the wall, and peered at the menus. The items were mostly traditional - nigiris and sashimis designed to let the fish shine. Since it was our first visit, we decided on the omakase (the chef's selection) numbers 2 and 4, as recommended by the waiter. Not long after, we were presented with edamame as snack. The beans were salted, and mixed with sesame oil and sesame seeds. Although a bit salty, these turned out to be the main entertainment during the widely variable waiting time between dishes. I asked for the bathroom to wash my hands, and  was given quite long, but precise directions: you go out of the back door, turn left, turn right to find the elevators, ride to the first floor, and continue straight ahead to find the loos. Ryú is a tenant in a rather upscale, fashion-oriented building, but since it was the weekend and the building was not active, this trip turned out a bit creepy. The first floor was dimly lit, with empty locals peering through papered windows. The women's bathroom was dark, and I patted the walls to find the light switch. To my horror, one of the two stalls was a complete mess, the toilet filled with the most disgusting... anyways. I closed the light, turned and left quickly.

Back to the restaurant, the first dish, salmon tataki, had come. The outer layer of the salmon had been slightly cooked, and the perfectly cut, thin slices looked delicious. The tataki was bathing in a slightly sweetened vinegar that gave the meat a little kick. There were five pieces, which we devoured in no time. A little later came three nigiris: salmon, red tuna and albacore. After a rather long wait, we then received the rest of our order almost at the same time. The Rainbow Ryú maki and Tuna Poke maki stood out from the bunch in appearance and taste, with the Rainbow maki being the most interesting, with basil in its flavor profile. The bill for two came up to about 70$, which is in my opinion rather expensive for the quantity of food offered. \"À la carte'' orders might be worth a shot, but they probably won't be any cheaper. The cost is likely related to their strict use of sustainably-sourced, and when possible, local products. If you take a look at their website, you can find more details on their commitment to the environment and charitable organizations.

It was a good and pleasant meal, without any kind of surprise. Although at first Ryú reminded me of Saint Sushi because of its music, dynamic team and urban vibes, it turned out completely different. There's no funky creations here, and the makis are much smaller."}
{"text":"My expectations for this restaurant were really high. After reading some reviews, I decided to pay a visit. Upon my entrance I was greeted at the door, the host/waiter was very enthusiastic and I liked it. The ambience was very pleasant too - cheesy music from MJ to The Police. The sushi was excellent. However, they kept on messing up with my order. I ordered a hand roll, and got a cut roll instead. Then they gave me the hand roll on the house (corrected the issue). But this wasn't the only issue. I also ordered extra nigiri that didn't make it to my table until I reminded them. It's okay if the restaurant is new, I take lightly this type of mistakes. Something that I hope the owner takes note though: is how employees should treat the customer. The host kept on poking me on my shoulder and obliques whenever wanted to check on me. Let's see if they improve!"}
{"text":"Small, modern Japanese restaurant with great sashimi and unique poke bowl! Sashimi was really fresh and delicious. The poke was not your usual rice bowl that's drenched with ponzu sauce but more dry and delicate taste. The dessert was disappointing. Very small place so you will probably have to book ahead during peak hours."}
{"text":"Very hip Japanese restaurant in downtown Montreal. Lovely decor and great food. Staff is very friendly. Super fresh fish and uni. Get the uni wagyu nigiri it's amazing! They have some great desserts like matcha tiramisu served in cute glass jars"}
{"text":"I have been to sushi places ranges from $10-Chinese to high ends like Miku, Yasu, Jabistro. 

Worst experience ever.

Service: 50 min before any food AND drink (tea) came. My table was empty before then. The server then tried to calm us with a complimentary edamame, which, like another commented, was cold and didnt taste good.

Food: nigiri prices were as high as top places in Toronto, but the fish were very average and sushi poorly made / presented. The rolls are like the ones you would find in supermarket. My friend did not want to finish them because the fish smelled. And how dear they called that beef slice wagyu...

TLDR: overpriced below-average sushi with very slow service."}
{"text":"Located in Carrefour's food court Ryu recently opened up and offers fresh sushi as well as a variety of Japanese cuisine. They also had Japanese BAHN MI!!!!! After 3 visits I'm ready to give my impressions. :)

I tried both the chicken and beef and they were quite good. Size is under the average size I'm used to but they're packed with ingredients. French rolls are just right. This is a very pleasant experience and quite yummy.

Service is pretty quick and very polite. My only concern is that I find the sandwich way too pricey which will impede me from being a regular. At nearly $9 a sandwich when I'm used to under $5 I'd expect a drink or side to come with it."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very small and is great for a peaceful lunch break and perhaps not ideal for a fri. night get together with friends. BUT what matters the most is that they have outstanding sushi compared to what is available in Montreal. I got lunch here today and tried a few nigiri and a couple of rolls and found everything quite satisfying. The fish is excellent and they come from responsible/sustainable resources. The  sushi pieces come at the perfect size with a beautiful mixture of flavors each -  yup! I've found my new fav sushi place in town. They have 3diff desserts, premade and displayed in the fridge next to the entrance door. The dessert containers have labels that clearly list all the ingredients, a blessing for anyone with any kind of food  allergy. I tried the matcha and thought it was fresh, smooth and well balanced. I'll try the chocolate one next time.

Ryu is definitely on the pricy side, particularly if you used to live in Vancouver.... But if you are in Montreal and are craving great nigiri and sushi roll with fresh fish that melts in your mouth, this might just be the place you are looking for :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi for Montreal standards! I got the salmon roll and the wasabi scallop roll. I would probably get the salmon roll again. The wasabi scallop roll was a bit pricy for what it was: small and couldn't really taste the wasabi. 

I sat at the bar with my friend. The workers were super friendly. They gave me a hot towel (to wash my hands) before the food came out! The set up of the restaurant is meant for a quick bite. There is also an fridge hidden in the front where you can buy pre-made sushi and drinks. I feel that if you were just peeping into the restaurant, you wouldn't be able to see the fridge. The food came our relatively slow, however; I think it's going to improve, considering that it's a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi spot in Montreal! The food was fresh and amazing, and the staff and service were wonderful. Had such a good time there! The Cajun Tuna and the Hamachi Jalapeno were amazing. Will definitely be visiting this place again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"It's actually surprisingly good, TBH I didn't expect this quality of sushi in Montreal.
It's a small restaurant with two chefs, one server and one manager?
However the service I find it so so, maybe the two gentlemen were too cool to smile?
I also like the decorations, overall nice vibe"}
{"text":"We couldn't have picked a better night to come here. Saturday night, we were one of two other patrons on a Saturday night (we were eating really late near closing time), and we had the full attention of the amazing staff. The sushi itself is really fresh and buttery. They were also able to accommodate a custom roll request, which they knocked out of the park. We also got a complimentary glass of wine due to a transitional time for them (they weren't serving a full bar at the time), which was the cherry on top to an already amazing experience. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Walked by and heard about Ryu sushi so ima give it a try. Turns out it's really good sushi is above average price is more also but your downtown so it's obvious"}
{"text":"Decent avocado toast made fresh to order - US terminal near Gate 79.  Lots of avocado, two slices of fresh bread and seasoning."}
{"text":"Came across this place while shopping in Carrefour Laval. It has very clean and spacious space, with 2 floors! You have the option of grabbing ready made sushi dishes in the fridge or getting your dish made at the counter.

I ended up trying their tuna poke bowl and their ebi tempura sushi roll. The dishes were decent sized, which you can share with one more person. The avocados and salmon were quite fresh, so the poke bowl and sushi tasted pretty good, but it's still nothing amazing. The quality was good, however the flavours were okay.

Although the food was good, the prices for their dishes are a little pricey (my meal coming up to 30$) for what they serve and the flavour they deliver. You can find the same quality but better flavour and cheaper prices in other sushi or Asian restaurants. Not my go-to place for sushi or Asian food, but would still come back sometimes if I crave for sushi or poke while shopping in Carrefour Laval."}
{"text":"Tatami Sushi at Gate 79 of the tansborder area is a perfect place to grab a quick sushi lunch before your flight.  The sushi stand has a tiny sitting area so you can eat right there. My favourites are spicy tuna and avocado rolls, and have been always fresh."}
{"text":"I had the $24 omakase dinner which tasted great. Unfortunately one of the people working there had some sort of incessant cough. He was working cash, serving drinks and setting tables so it was quite unsanitary in my opinion. That's the only reason I docked one star."}
{"text":"Fresh, simple and delicate 
A must go for sushi in Montreal 
And I know what I'm talking about ;)
Don't be shy try the Omakase"}
{"text":"Easily the worst poke bowl I've ever had. But can you even call it that? That's what their menu says, so I'm going with it.

I ordered the Salmon Basil.

Ingredients:

- Torn and haphazardly sliced bits of salmon. Normally, these cuts would be consigned to delivery in spicy salmon filling, but today they will arrive in your poke bowl.
- Lima beans. Pretty weird.
- Half-ripened mango chunks. Had to chew through part of a rind on one.
- Sushi rice. There was actually vinegar in it, to my surprise. 
- Basil-mayonnaise sauce. As this was essentially mayo with basil seasoning thrown in, it was thick as hell. Weird.

This was unrecognizable as a poke bowl, really. Think of it more as a minced fish salad, do away with ideas of complementary flavors or blendings of ingredients, and your expectations will be set more reasonably.

The airport is one of the few places in Montreal where you can get lousy eats."}
{"text":"The makis and the nigiri were great, the fishes were very fresh and the difference can be tasted. The thing I was not a fan of was the poke bowl. Too much of the same flavour. Maybe if they had half portion it would have been better.

My fav were the bio salmon roll and the seared Waygu beef nigiri. 

The place is not good for bring kids what so ever, so don't do the same mistake as I do and bring a toddler. Strongly avoid doing that. Also there's no cooked food so it's really hard to give anything to my toddler.

P.s. Warm hand towels to clean at the beginning was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great little sushi place in downtown Montreal.  Very small and intimate interior, without feeling cramped.

We ordered two of the dinner omakase options, #1 and #4.  

Something to note, because it's not specifically mentioned on the menu, omakase #3 is for 2 people, not an individual.

The sushi was very good, but nothing unique, and we were both satisfied. Technically, Ryú's \"omakase\", isn't true omakase, which usually involves the chef crafting several courses tailored to your tastes and what you like.  Ryú's version is more akin to a dinner combo.  But still very good."}
{"text":"Awful service, Good food! Not friendly, they don't give you a chance to ask about anything"}
{"text":"I recommend this restaurant if you are downtown and want to pick up some good affordable sushi. The only thing is that I wish it was more of a sit down restaurant. My friend took me out here for my birthday and I felt the tables were very small and we had to sit side by side because the restaurant is set up that way.  

All they have is wine, sake and beer. The waitress said they would come up with a cocktail menu soon. 

We ordered the Dinner menu #2 which was only $30 and then added another sashimi and two sushi rolls. 

First we had the edamame and it was good! They were salted and had sesame seeds and I think even sesame oil. I will definitely try to recreate it at home if I buy frozen edamames. The salmon sashimi was not what I expected. It's not your typical pieces of sashimi. It was more of a tataki. The \"sashimi\" were thin slices and it was in a sauce. We also added the Hamachi Jalapeno (Yellowtail) sashimi. The jalapeno was spicy and really added a kick to the sashimi! Both sashimi were good and fresh but the hamachi was probably my favorite because of the jalapeno. I love spicy but for people who don't stay away from this sashimi. Then we had three different types of nigiri (the striped bass, the albacore, and salmon). They gave two of each type of nigiri. 

We had the Ryu Rainbow which is made of tuna, salmon, cucumber, wakame (seaweed), tempura, soy paper, rice paper, spicy mayo, and basil mayo . We also ordered the Bio Salmon which is made of salmon tartare, torched salmon, nori, and spicy mayo. Both were good but I preferred the Ryu Rainbow if I had to pick one. The only downside was that the sushi would stick to the plate so it was hard to pick up with chopsticks. The Bio Salmon has little cut up lemon on top and I preferred it the sushi without it. 
 
I was going to give this restaurant 4 stars but as I'm writing this review I just now realized that we never got our Toro Cut Roll (4 pieces) and the Hamachi Cut Roll (4 pieces) that is supposed to come with the dinner menu!! I had asked the waitress if there was more sushi coming and she had said no!!  They had taken back the menu so I did not question her and I did not check! Damn that's 8 pieces of sushi that we never got!! Not cool!!!"}
{"text":"Really cute spot! The sushi rice is really amazing. The miso soup is also really really well done! Not really ideal for groups or lounging more like a fancy upscale sushi bar/shop. I had the miso for an appetizer and then the sashimi platter. The speciality rolls also look very good. The price is steep but it's good sushi and sustainable fish."}
{"text":"The food was great. Nigiri and sashimi was so fresh and smelled so delightful. Ask for the the chefs specials and recommendations which aren't on the menus."}
{"text":"I am not a big Sushi fan, but my son is. He really wanted sushi and this place was on our way to the metro. 
We had to wait 10 min for the sushi which is fine, since it means we get freshly made stuff. When we got home my sin loved it ate 11 pices. I also loved it. I got a very basic veggy ones but the rice was perfect, the soy beans were excellente, the only down side is that we got only one soy sauce serving for 32 pieces of sushi! They gave enough wasabi, enough ginger so are you so cheap on the soy sauce?"}
{"text":"So delicious! I had a craving for sushi and decided to order Ryù via Uber Eats. Service was fast and the quality of the fish was mind-blowing. From the configuration of the bento box to the quality of the rice and the fish, it is indubitable that Ryù is worthwhile. I took the combo 2 and the hamachi was the scene stealer. The only reason I did not put 5 stars is because the edamame was bland. Otherwise, one of the best sushi places in Montreal!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere of this little restaurant. I tried the Ryu pokebowl twice to-go since it's so close to my office. It's a good recipe, sophisticated execution and very healthy (not overly salty), but I feel like the fish here (tuna and salmon) is simply not great enough to appreciate minimalist seasoning, and as a result Im less intrigued to come back for the sushi, but maybe some cooked dishes"}
{"text":"Very good sushi place! I really enjoyed the combo I got. It was fresh, flavourful and the rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The place itself is clean and they have a small fridge where you can grab some sushi to go."}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL! My boyfriend and I were in Montreal for the Grand Prix weekend and decided to walk along Peel street on our last night and find a place to enjoy a nice meal. We walked by RYU which had a stunning patio assembled and was playing awesome music. We ordered edamame which was incredibly seasoned and dined on four rolls (8 pieces each) - Hamachi baby, White Miso, Salmon Truffle, and Halibut. 

This sushi was so incredibly flavourful, fresh, and innovative. Our server, whom I regrettably forgot their name was fantastic! He was quick to make great recommendations, made great conversation and you got a sense that he enjoyed coming to work. 

The atmosphere was everything you could want, especially during a celebratory weekend like the Grand Prix. The music was great, and created for a lounge type feel. This restaurant is a fantastic spot and I will certainly make a point to come back on my next trip! An absolute must!!"}
