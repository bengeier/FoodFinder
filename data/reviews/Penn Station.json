{"text":"This place is clean and the customers servies you get is really good. the last time i was there i was going to share my sandwhich and fries, they heard this and offerd to spit it for us."}
{"text":"There was a time when Penn Station subs were huge and had plenty of meat on them. Those days are over.  A few years ago they started making their sub buns much more narrow with much less meat on them, yet they continue to raise their prices. I used to feel full after eating a six or eight inch sub from here, but now I am still hungry after eating them, and their monthly special is not a good deal at all. You get a small drink, a tiny 6 inch sub and a tiny portion of french fries that is laughable, and you pay nearly $10 for it. Nowadays they put so little meat on their philly cheesesteak that many bites of it are just a mouth full of bread."}
{"text":"I normally don't review places, but the staff was so nice, and the food was yummy. Clean, decent prices, and the best lemonade ever!"}
{"text":"I went there and the guy making the sandwiches was on his cell phone on a personal call. He also did not wear gloves while making my order. I was grossed out and left and went somewhere else"}
{"text":"Nothing beats a Philly Cheesesteak Sub from Penn Station - so much greasy goodness.  The fries are pretty good too if you like wedges."}
{"text":"Horrible place!  Dirty, old, smelly.  Took almost 45 min to get our order on a sat night.  The other patrons were saying what we were thinking.  Never again.  Unacceptable!  Underdtaffed and the head guy acted like we were inconveniencing Him.  Really?  Lose the attitude.  It was very expensive compared to other places. There are so many other choices.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I had a basic chicken parm sandwich here which wasn't bad. You can't really go wrong with something that is cheesy and toasty. The fries were a little too greasy for my taste but are decent."}
{"text":"I love Penn Station, the food is always hot and the fresh cut fries and fresh squeezed lemonade are amazing. If it's your first time eat in, I find the fries don't retain heat very well and are usually cold after getting home and you're going to want more lemonade. I far prefer this far over Subway or Potbellies if I'm going for a hot sandwich."}
{"text":"What's up with the grease-soaked sandwiches here? I came in here on a moderately busy Sunday night and ordered a, 8\" parmesean chicken sandwich, expecting it to be any regular sandwich that I buy a campustown eatery, but, my goodness, this was probably the most awful sub I have ever eaten.   After mind-numbingly slow service (from payment to sandwich was 15 minutes), a visually appetizing sub came out, with chicken, mushrooms, onions, topped with a layer of melted cheese. As I grab the sandwich, the middle just starts dripping everywhere, and by the third bite, the bottom just falls apart. The rest of the meal was just a struggle to get the greasy concoction back between the slices of bread. I guess the food tasted alright, but it just takes away from the experience when you have a mess of food dribbling all over your hands. I come here to get a sandwich for a reason because it's easy and quick to eat.   The fries, too, were just terrible. I don't think I even tasted any potato inside of the fried exterior. They were hard, bland, and unappealing!   Perhaps this was just an off-day for them. I've had better at other Penn Station locations."}
{"text":"Great service! Quick subs that taste amazing! Very friendly staff! Quiet place but good atmosphere!"}
{"text":"How did I never go to Penn Station during my 4 years in Champaign? Stopped in over the weekend for lunch while back in town and I really missed out! Their subs are awesome- unique and not like other chains. They are toasty but not dry, and their fries are delicious and salty. The college student employees were very friendly on a day when they probably would have rather been at the football game than working. Now I need to find a Penn Station near Chicago!"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese steak sandwich. Will be back to try a few other menu options I was tossed up between during my visit."}
{"text":"The chicken parmesan is the bombbb. Hot, fresh, gooey cheese... mmm. Friendly service too."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 sub's. 1 with meat and cheese only, the second one with meat, cheese and mayo and the third was a hot steak with everything.   Picked up order to bring home and once home we realized two of the subs were not even close to what we ordered and the cheese steak was so soggy that the bread feel apart.  Called to speak with manager and they were rude. The manager said she would have her manager call us but never heard from anyone. Would not recommend this place... Have not had any problems at other Penn Stations, only the Cedar Road store. Employers need to have better training in customer service!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! We stopped in to order a sub and it is unsanitary. The workers were making sandwiches with no gloves, just bare hands, then going to the register to handle money. They would touch the register, money, and food without washing hands or wearing gloves. My husband didn't even want to order and sandwich and I threw mine away."}
{"text":"I avoided Penn Station for the longest time based solely on the premise that CU did not need another sandwich chain. Let me just say, that was a BIG mistake. I've drop kicked Subway out of my rotation and replaced it with Penn Station. Granted, I've never gotten beyond the Italian (so many yummy flavors!), you just can't beet the uniqueness of PS. And, the fresh french fries and lemon aid are terrific. The staff at this location are always friendly, too. Give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly staff. Orders go quick and the food is fantastic. One of the best sub stops around. However, more ESPN on the tv would be great. Less CNN.  Especially during football season."}
{"text":"I used to be a fan of Penn Station.  They changed how they made my favorite sandwich, changing the taste drastically, making it much more bland.  I thought this might have been a mistake the first time, the second time I spoke to the manager and they said the recipe had been changed but I could ask to have it made the old way.  The third time I asked for it to be made the old way and I asked this of an employee that I recognized as having worked there long enough to know.  Again, it was completely bland and tasteless, the new way.  I wrote to the management and explained to them that I didn't like this new recipe and even when asked to make it the old way, I received it the new way.  I told them that I wanted to see some kind of concession made so that I could enjoy the sandwich the way I knew it (which really was a simple change, but probably meant a bit more expense per sandwich, adding up to a lot if done with everyone).  They didn't reply to me, no one offered a discount for another sandwich because I had spent full price three times on what I believed was a sub-standard sandwich.  So, I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Expensive - Decent s/w - Long wait after ordering  Compared to other places around at UofI's campus, this place does stand out as somewhat nicer and more refined when it comes to the restaurant atmosphere. The somewhat small and elongated setup makes the place a little cramped.  A good sandwich with a fair amount of variety to choose from on the menu. However, compared to other places around, this is the most expensive sandwich you can get. The small can be about $5-6 and a medium is $7ish. With a drink and fries, you are looking at upwards of $10. Fries and freshly cut and they also serve freshly squeezed lemonade.   Service can be faster considering all they are serving are sandwiches, i've often had to wait 7-10mins even when the place didn't have too many customers."}
{"text":"This is an old review.  The workers do not wear gloves and don't care.  The food is ok, but it will probably make give you chest pains."}
{"text":"Toasted sandwiches are the way to go. Such it Subway. The Philly cheese steak and chicken Teriyaki were my favorites. The fries were pretty good."}
{"text":"I have always liked this place. Place is clean as another review mentioned and the food is good. Fries and lemonade are good as well.Its better then subway by far."}
{"text":"Penn Station is very often a delicious alternative to the boring \"sandwich/sub\" restaurants which are so very popular. It's not quite fast food but it's certainly no high-class cuisine, either. What they offer is hot and cold subs which can be augmented to some extent, but mostly you are choosing a kind of sub like you would anywhere else. What is different is they eschew any idea of \"healthy\" meals from their menu and understand that people just want tasty, filling food. And that's what you get. Ingredients that taste great and vegetables that taste pretty good, too. They offer fresh-cut fries and homemade lemonade which both taste great.   What I recommend are the hot sandwiches. I've tried almost all of them, and almost all of them have been great. That being said, for some reason, the cold options are not so great. Especially the tuna. I don't remember a time when I thought a sandwich could have too much sugar in it outside of an icecream sandwich, but this thing is like candied tuna with candied pickle juice. Guh-ross. But that's ok. Now you know not to get that. Try the hot italian. This is a satisfying freaking sandwich. Everything on it is perfect, from the banana peppers to the bread. Yummers!  This particular branch made me sad. Their current \"sandwich artist\" messed up my girlfriend's order twice and the customer before us 3 times. So, this one gets 3 stars. Maybe go to another one. And get the lemonade."}
{"text":"When I took my first bite ever of a sandwich from Penn Station, I thought it was one of the best sandwiches I've had in the C-U area. After more visits there, I realized there really isn't much to it. Penn Station serves nice toasted subs, but they are incredibly greasy with skimpy portions. This is a place I only go to every few months when the craving hits me. I would not put it in my usual restaurant rotation.  Like another reviewer has posted, the fries are terrible. They managed to be visibly salty, rock hard, and greasy. I'd only order them if you want a vehicle for moving grease from the restaurant's kitchen to your stomach."}
{"text":"One of the best subs I have had in awhile, honest.  Two people can easily split the medium fry BTW so dont go straight for the large, lol."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Penn Station location. Some of the employees have been there for a long time. Super clean and friendly.   They always have the daily newspaper on the counter, so you and flip through it while you wait.   It is a little pricey, but I really do love their artichoke sandwich. I wish there were more coupons. Occasionally I get one for free fries, but I would probably go more often if I got sub coupons."}
{"text":"I love Penn Station's artichoke sandwich, just not from this one. They weigh out the ingredients, which I don't see at my regular location. I never see them wipe the scale down afterwards.  Updated: This place has gone leaps and bounds. Much nicer service, almost too nice. Place is cleaner. I haven't seen the older, mean manager, maybe that's why? Sometimes too much oregano, but I can't complain. Close to work, will be back and often."}
{"text":"Good, honest subs, and wonderful fries.... I love their steak & cheese sandwiches which they make (fortunately) with a white cheese rather than Cheez Whiz, using a pretty good bread which reportedly comes from Cincinatti.  Very friendly staff, comfortable seating, free convenient parking.  Yum!"}
{"text":"great sandwich place, way better than most of the other chains in town,  Great fries and great service.  Kind of grease, but good ingredients."}
{"text":"Very good food, inexpensive but taste damn good. My girlfriend introduced me to Penn Station and I have been hooked since. The manager is usually there cooking and greets you quickly when you walk through the door, food is made fast and hot. You can choose different sub lengths so I don't know how previous reviews could say they left hungry. I usually get a 6\" and share a small fry and my girlfriend and I leave full. They always thank you on the way out the door as well. Good food, good service, quick, inexpensive, and clean. I really have no idea how you could complain about anything."}
{"text":"Definitely an outstanding crew. They get backed up during lunch rush but it's because they are so good. I've tried and recommend the pizza sub, philly cheesesteak, and the italian. All very good subs. Fries are always hot and fresh to order."}
{"text":"So SLOW!  No one else is here!  Nice guy took the order.  Cindy was nice.  Another woman cooking was rude to the others there and being argumentative.  Glad we got our food to go.  Chicken teriyaki was way too salty for me and my boyfriend.  Just okay."}
{"text":"Top notch customer service at this location. It is very clean inside as well. Food was quick, fresh and hot.   Each employee seemed polite and were friendly.  Best Penn station I've been to."}
{"text":"Had my first visit to Penn Station.  I'm always skeptical when places like this advertise \"East Coast\" anything, be it subs, pizza, whatever, as I am Brooklyn born and raised.  Their resemblence to any East Coast fare is usually pure hype.  I ordered the Italian sausage with onions and peppers and a small fries.  The sub was quite good.  Very tasty.  The fries were fresh and above fast food standards.  Offering little packets of malt vinegar for the fries was a nice touch.  Service was relatively quick and friendly.  I give it three stars rather than four because four stars says that I'm a fan.  Much as I enjoyed my first experience there, I'm not a fan, just a satisfied customer.  East Coast?  Well, the sub I had, though good,  was certainly not up to the standards of a Sausage HERO in Little Italy."}
{"text":"Yummy. Good food quickly. A million times better than subway or jimmy johns.    Hot sandwiches and cheesesteaks are their specialty."}
{"text":"I had the dagwood and it was not too bad!!  They have great customer service here too."}
{"text":"I came here a few times when I worked in Eastlake. I spotted the greatest femullet in the history of femullets here. It was also a ginger; a truly rare find.   It is clean and Penn Station fries are amazing.   They serve Dr.Pepper AND great lemonade. What isn't to love?"}
{"text":"Just got a smoked ham Dagwood and they sprinkled some kind of gross spice all over it and it tasted like hay."}
{"text":"Having frequented nearly every sandwich chain in the country this was our first stop at a Penn Station. Prior to this, honestly, I'd never heard of one. The service was excellent. Management has done a great job training employees to be well mannered, friendly and helpful. As for the sandwiches they are a splitting image of Quiznos. If you've ever been to one of those (also a chain) you'll find almost the same menu here. This isn't a new concept or a better one with a twist, unfortunately. Possibly the biggest difference is they hand cut fries here and have just ok fresh squeezed lemonade.   Why come to Penn Station over the other sandwich chains? There's a Panera across the street which has a better selection of cold cut type sandwiches and a Jimmy Johns there, too. Penn Station blows away spots like Jimmy Johns and Subway, no one will argue that. It's a tad below Jersey Mikes, on the other hand.   We left with a few things in mind: fair price, great service, slightly above average sandwich and a good place to come if you need to get in and out quickly. There's nothing that wowed us to return right away. It's a standard model we've seen in the sandwich world for a decade or more. The only difference is they might have more hot subs here. Meanwhile, you shouldn't be able to find anything to complain about, which isn't the case at Jimmy Johns and Subway where quality falls far short."}
{"text":"Went to Penn Station for lunch and had a very positive experience! Service was excellent. Very efficient & friendly staff. Management was visible and working alongside staff. Food was hot and cooked to perfection. I will be back for lunch very soon!!"}
{"text":"My office used to order from here about once a month until I finally turned them onto something better. The tuna sub tastes like premade tuna salad so I tried the artichoke sub on our next order. This sub had so much mayonnaise you couldn't taste anything else. It was a gross sloppy mess. 2 stars only because the french fries are good and you can tell they are hand cut and fresh."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were decent. Service was fast and very friendly. I didn't get to try the fries, because i was taking food to go. (I hate cold fries.)  Im still undecided on the bread. I think i will order another type of sandwich next time so that I can taste the bread. Another reviewer said the bread was amazing. I got the Ruben. The only complaint i had was that the sauerkraut wasn't real flavorful. Not a big deal though."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and helpful. They made our food quick.  That said.  Double check your orders. Mine was conpletely wrong.  My girlfriends was not. So it was 50/50 for us."}
{"text":"I try my hardest to eat right 6 out of 7 days of the week. On that 7th day, I like to go all out. And by all out, I mean eat everything in site.   Enter Penn Station. I used to go here all the time in my fat days. All. the. Time. Once I decided to get healthy, I parted ways with this place for over 5 years. Once I learned how to moderate, I decided that I was in the mood for cheesesteak.   I was happy that there was a location close to where I lived. What I like is that they make everything fresh to order when you order it from the sandwiches to the fries.   The philly is worth every bit of calories it is jam packed with and the fries are wonderfully seasoned and have the perfect amount of crunch.   I'm glad I rekindled this romance with penn station. While I do eat right, it's nice to just eat something like what penny station offers once in a while"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service,  food was fresh and delicious. Definitely will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, awesome fries and lemonade! The Philly Cheesesteak never disappoints."}
{"text":"The whole interaction was bad from the beginning. I tried to call in my order, it rang busy right up until I walked in. I later realized the phone was off the hook. I walked in and was told they would be right with me.  5 full minutes later, I had been standing there and my order not taken. I looked at the disheveled staff, pants hanging below butts, hair being slung over the food and general uncleanness. I phoned in my order to Burgers to Beer next door. I will not be back here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Penn Station's in general, but this one makes a pretty good sandwich.  The fries are fresh and the sammy is hot.  It's in a tough location off of the main arteries in Solon, but worth the find for a quick lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Penn Station is a chain but their subs are amazing! The bread is what makes the sub. Perfect food for the day after a long night out. Their fries and fresh cute and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It is 4:03pm on a Saturday and the place is packed. They got my order correctly made and in a matter a short time. They where friendly, hard working and efficient. I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Second time different visit and they still screwed it up. Charged me more money for what I ordered. Horrible manager and subpar food. Gone downhill. Don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love cheese steak.  Although a bit pricy, Penn Station tends to have the best cheese steak in the area.  My only grip is that you have to place your order in two locations.  The first is near the grill.  There you order your sandwich and any fries.  You then have to walk down to the other side of the counter to order your drink and pay your bill.  Often times I found myself waiting 5 or more minutes at this second station before anyone comes.  This seems to be a problem with several Penn Stations that I have gone to."}
{"text":"Horrible, horrible service. 7 subs took over an hour. They forgot to put one of the subs on the order so had to go back and order the 7th sub. In the middle of our order, the girl taking our order decided to answer the phone, extremely rude. Half of the subs were incorrect, ordered no mayo but slathered with mayo, lettuce left off of sandwiches, ordered no pickles but came with pickles. This was really terrible."}
{"text":"So this is a typical sub chain. I like their variety though. they incorporate Asian, Italian, and American influences into their sub which is cool. They also have light option subs that are primarily veggie and fish items. Also, it's nice that any sub can be converted into a salad or wrap. So really, I mean it when I say there is something for everyone here. Their serving size is also generous. I'm a five foot woman and I think that the smallest sub (6 in.) and a small side of fries is sufficient for me. Although I wouldn't say it was a good place for dessert, their chocolate chip cookies are totally amazing and def worth the price. They are gooey and chocolately really anything you want in a cookie.   So although my review is full of positives, here is why I can't give it 5 stars. If you're working in the food industry, the service has got to be good. If you're working at a place like Penn Station, you have got to be quick and know what you're doing. I feel that during the lunch rush a handful of the employees need a little help. I get it that everyone needs help but you should put your best staff in front during the lunch rush because that's when people wanna get their food and leave. So yes the food is very tasty and worth the price but be prepared to wait a bit before getting your food."}
{"text":"I have not tried anything here other than their signature cheesesteak sandwiches, nor have I had a cheesesteak elsewhere in Cleveland .  That being said, the cheesesteak is really great, and the place would get more stars, but it's still a chain and still greasy fast food that cannot be that good for me.    Still and all, this sometimes hits just the perfect spot, and is definitely one to remember when that's what you need.  Best when you can share a medium and fries with someone else, as these are pretty big.    Tuesday is free cookie day."}
{"text":"Not spectacular but it's reliable. You get what you ask for. There's other better sandwich shops/chains that are better but this is good when you have nothing else"}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite sub joint. The Italian is a strong favorite, and the philly steak is decent. I just wish they had breaded buffalo chicken. The specialty fries and lemonade are good too."}
{"text":"You guys were awesome! Incredible service. Friendly staff. And the food was fresh and off the charts! We were there w our baby too. You guys are doing a great job!"}
{"text":"Stopped at the the drive up for lunch... waited 10 mins and got no service. Even had a girl try to bring me a sub that wasn't mine. Still never took my order...."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches, this place has conquered the sandwich.  It's pretty much the most unhealthy meal but once in a while it's okay.  My favorite is the Italian.  There's so much grease I usually have a pool at the bottom of the basket.  Doesn't sound like much to desire, but the food is out of this world.  The fries are even the best I've ever had.  They're handcut with the skins on.  They aren't wedges, they're regular fries.  This place is great, but plan to walk it off after eating here."}
{"text":"Penn Station exceeded my expectations.  I had an artichoke sub with mushrooms, and it was delicious.  I'd give the place another star for a better delivery method.  You give your name with your order and get a receipt, then they call your name and you go fetch your order, at least for carry out.  i think dine-in gets delivery to the table.  One small  sandwich does not make history, but for today, it rocked."}
{"text":"First place to eat on my Brown County trip for a Hohulin family reunion. I will say that it was cowarded by it was lunchtime when we were their. I really liked the Pepperoni sandwich and the fries that came with it."}
{"text":"I recently went to Penn Station. I got the Chicken Parmesan sandwich and it was very good. The fries were very fresh and absolutely delicious. However, my only complaint would be the service. I had called and ordered ahead, expecting my order to be ready. However, I still had to wait 15 more minutes as a frazzled staff couldn't get the orders straight. The man at the register was very helpful, but the lady behind the counter did not know what she was doing. Good food, but staff needs more training."}
{"text":"The taste of the food gets a solid 5 stars, the employees on the other hand... Terrible. Everyone was rude except the gentleman cleaning the dining room. They messed up several other orders while I was there. Granted my order was correct. I would go for the food but beware of the employees. Chicken Parmesan with grilled onions and banana peppers, can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I love their chicken teriyaki sandwich.  The bread is my favorite part of this place.  Its reminiscent of like... cuban bread or something.  I like."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I placed my order for 12:30 and they didn't have my food ready for me until 12:38. I ordered it for both my coworker and I and as we sat down to eat, he found a hair in his food. Don't think I'll be coming back to this location for a long time."}
{"text":"Lemonade is good. Fries were good.  Sandwich was underwhelming. I ordered the cheesesteak and companion got the Reuben. More bread than meat. I wanted to give it 3.5 stars but there isn't an option for that."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are never good, they are always sort of bland. They should offer cheez wiz for the authentic cheesesteak experience. The lemonade is good though. The fries are greasy and boring.  Not sure why this place gets so much praise."}
{"text":"I honestly can't find it in me to give this any more than 1 star. Overpriced considering quality of food. My last visit will probably be my last visit here. Sandwich is absolutely nothing to brag about and I'm speaking of the philly. I occasionally get a philly sandwich from a local whole in the wall bar and would prefer that sandwich 10/10 times over penn station."}
{"text":"When one eats subs, they expect their subs to be healthy and bland, and they expect to lose weight like Jared Fogle did. Wrong. Be a real man and grow out of that over-advertised crap. There are so many better sub restaurants out there, even if they are worse for you. Penn Station is among the best and most diverse.  Penn Station makes \"East Coast subs\", whatever the hell those are. I imagine some guy with a Brooklyn accent cooking up Philly cheesesteaks representing what \"East Coast subs\" is about. Seeing this is Akron and that accent is impossible to find, I can rest assured that I was at least half right about that notion. Philly cheesesteaks are, indeed, on the menu. I had one of the 10\" combo deals, and it was very greasy. The sandwich wasn't terrible, but it wasn't as good as I would have liked it to be. Let's just say Mr. Philly Cheesesteak himself, Tony Luke (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Luke,_Jr.), would be thoroughly disappointed.  I came here one other time, but it was late and night and I don't remember much, but I too am quite glad this place has exploded. My only complaint is that it is kinda pricey, so don't come expecting to pay $5 for a foot long combo ($10 is more accurate). If you are hungry for a sub, make sure to give this place a try. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I have the answer to any New Years resolution diet: Philly Cheese Steak.   Yes, that's right. One my first days of 2011 was spent scarfing one of these bad boys down and wiping the grease off my chin--with a side of fresh cut fries and a lemonade, no less.   I know it's a chain, and I don't indulge all the time, but dagnabbit Penn Station cooks up a mighty fine sub. The fresh bread is friggin' delish, toasted to perfection and holds all the delectable toppings inside perfectly. Cheesy steak, grilled onions, mushrooms, hot peppers, lettuce and tomato all folded up.... is it bad that my mouth is watering right now?   You can actually watch them cooking your food right in front of you, all fresh. Not to mention fresh cut fries with malt vinegar prepared while you wait for your sandwich.   Lemonade squeezed homemade. Yeah, that's not a complete sentence, but I feel that it speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Sign up for their website, they are constantly have contests and sending coupons. I like their chicken teriyaki, cheesesteaks and this is one of the few places to get fries with your sandwich in Solon."}
{"text":"It's a chain restaurant, but it's a good one! Friendly employees, tv is always on CNN, and things are clean cut and simple-like life should be. No complaints here, but if you're allergic to peanuts, you might complain-or die. All their subs and fries are cooked in peanut oil. Careful!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!  The Chicken Parmesan is the best. Fresh squeezed lemonade. And always get a chocolate chip cookie!"}
{"text":"When I went there for the first time, I asked them if their bread was vegan (I could figure out the topppings on my own), and they didn't know.  So, I \"googled\" it and realized that it is.  I told them (thinking they would like to know), but they didn't seem to care.  Come on, I can't be the only person that will want to know!  Anyway, the food is spot-on heavenly every time!  Philly cheese is the way to go, along with fries & a lemonade. The artichoke sandwich with pizza sauce (without cheese) is vegan!    I do think, their employees need to be more senstive to those with disabilities.   Why have an ADA compliant rest room when the high chairs are blocking access? I was there tonight & some guy couldn't get through! I moved them for him, even though a worker was standing right there at the drink station! I was really irritated. She could have offered to get out of his way and help me move the chairs. Once he got out, they moved the chairs back! The next person in a wheel chair won't be so lucky:(  Easy to park, quick service and great food."}
{"text":"excellent service, good taste. fries so so. sandwiches not customizable... which was different...  they need to expand further out east..."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and enjoyed  a great meal.  The place is very clean and the workers are super friendly.  Had to wait 5 minutes for our sandwich, but at least it was made fresh."}
{"text":"First the bad... they messed up my order twice. A bunch of young kids working in there when I stopped around 6pm.   But that's pretty much where the bad ended. The food is fresh and delicious. The kids (employees), especially the cashier was super friendly and respectful. The tv made the wait easier. Restaurant was clean and I enjoyed my dinner there. Would def return if wanting a sub."}
{"text":"I am from the west coast and Penn Station chains are new to me. I went there for lunch and tried the Philly and it was super good. They also offer fresh lemonade FROM LEMONS so if you are a lemonade drinker I highly recommend it. The food was great but the service was meh that being said I see myself being a regular customer."}
{"text":"Came here for a cheesesteak, the mix of spicy mustard & mayo ruins the taste. In fact, the entire sandwich was terrible. What I'm trying to say is, don't settle for this place. Wendy's is across the street and Fat Sandwich, one block south. Ur welcome!"}
{"text":"A few co workers and I had strolled into this fine establishment for lunch.  I already heard via word of mouth how great the Philly's were.. so my expectations were kinda set pretty high and I was definitely not disappointed! I ordered a Philly with fries, fresh squeezed lemonade, and a chocolate chip cookie aka \"heaven on earth\".  The Philly was loaded w/ grilled steak peppers mushrooms and some incredibly tasty grilled onions..ok Back to the cookie...this may possibly have been one of the best I've ever had if not the top 3 I'd say.  It's this astoundingly delicious big, fat, baked to perfection filled cookie with these watering milk chocolate chunks.  If you are allergic to chocolate then I understand however, for the rest of the yelp population who goes to Penn Station and does NOT at least try this cookie once is nuts!"}
{"text":"Best sub sandwiches at any chain restaurant places actually clean which is a big plus for the Champaign-Urbana area indecent poop a little on the pricey side but you do get what you pay for in this world so it's worth it"}
{"text":"Staff is extremely friendly. I've showed up about 20 minutes prior to closing thinking they would be annoyed with me, but I got the opposite treatment. They were super nice and even gave me the last remaining cookie. The fries are cut and fried to order so they're extremely fresh. I've had the Italian, Chicken Cordon Bleu, and the Reuben. They were all very good... I'd say the Italian was my favorite. I've gotten it hot and cold and both versions were equally good. I also like that they have both sweetened and unsweetened iced tea. I will be coming back again for sure."}
{"text":"I think Penn Station is great.... a little pricey but you do get great quality subs here.  I like their Philly Cheese steaks.   I would only give them -1 star because their subs always come with a lot of grease which i'm not a fan of.  I also like their Italian sub and their chicken subs isn't to bad either.  Their lemonade is very good and freshly squeezed.   Their fries are pretty good as well and you do get a lot when ordering med and greater sizes.  I would come back here a lot more often but It's just not healthy.  Finding coupons helps a little with the pricing but to be honest they beat out Charley's subs and way better then Subway and Quizno's and Mr Hero, They beat out Jimmy John's as well but JJ's just do cold subs so can't really compare them."}
{"text":"I usually love this place, the manager is great. The girl at the counter either  does not have any personality or she ran out of it over lunch rush. The lady working the sandwich line on the other hand had a great smile and was very friendly. When I got home with my chicken salad sandwich I was very disappointed though, literally not even a tablespoon of chicken salad and not a single piece of chicken on my sandwich. And the sandwiches are not cheap, but usually they are worth it... not today."}
{"text":"What a great place!! They greet you walking in, and wish you a great day when you leave. Nice touch. I had the artichoke sub and fries. Out of this world good!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing before.  I think the management changed and now it really bad. The girl who was taking orders acted like she was pissed off at me for ordering more sandwiches. I waited on the cash register for more than 10 mins & no one was attending. Another guy waiting for his order for long time & told me that if he were me he would walk out if not ordered already."}
{"text":"For a place to grab quick sandwich, Penn Station lies somewhere between Quiznos and Subway. I think their sub is tastier than Quiznos although there is less selection. If health and calorie intake are your concern, Subway is the way to go. Good fresh lemonade and decent fries. This particular location is very busy especially for dinner. You may have to wait up to 20 mintues even though they have like 7-8 staff working. Can be frustrated when you order to go."}
{"text":"Been here twice now. Not entirely sure where the other reviewers are seeing friendly staff. Both times the staff seemed very unhappy to be there and make my orders. Other than that, the food was good. More than likely I'll keep swinging by here, but probably won't ever dine in."}
{"text":"The Penn Station chain is ok, but not really my cup of tea.  I have been to the PS here as well as Sagamore (on R.82) and Parma as well as other assorted places.  When you walk in generally you are looking at a high wall and placing the order is awkward.  When asked if they have a combo type meal (samich w.frie and drink) many do not it is all al a carte unless you buy their variation of \"this months or weeks special\".......not bad but not awesome either.  The fries are good, but sorry I still think the five guys fries are the best.  The PS fries are thinner and you get less and they are not as tasty.  The Reuben was not good, stick with what they are known for: cheese steak sandwich.  Wish they would toast all buns inside and out, would be awesome, the price is not cheap."}
{"text":"Meh is one word how i'd describe it. The cheesteak wasn't took bad, but nothing to brag about. The fries were terrible. Overall, I walked out of here feeling like I should have gone to Firehouse subs."}
{"text":"They have pretty good subs, however they are kind of pricey.  If you're a student it's well worth getting the student combo special.  Also, their home squeezed lemonade is amazing."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, fresh cut fries, I really enjoy their food.  The problem is that they overcharge.  When it comes to a campus sandwich you don't expect to spend more than $8.00 or so.  However, for a small sandwich, small fries, and a drink you'll end up spending more like $12.00-14.00.  Also, the people who work there have always been rather rude to me. They have an attitude as if you walking into the business and ordering some food is giant inconvenience to them. If it lowered it's prices, and hired people who cared about customer service, I'd be there everyday."}
{"text":"This Penn station location is great as far as fast food goes. I typically don't eat fast food often. However this location is super clean and has polite employees (especially Tasha).  I come here maybe 3 times a month. They never mess my order up or cross contaminate my food ( I'm vegetarian and notice these things). Kudos to this new location keep up the good work. Stop in and try it out if you haven't had Penn station yet."}
{"text":"This was my first toasted Steak and Cheese with Marinara Sauce on it.  I loved it.  I think it was one of the tastiest subs I ever ate."}
{"text":"Gotta be one of the best sub places if your looking for the all around package.  Amazing fries... truly.  Sandwiches are very tasty.  You can tell the put some pride into making your food as opposed to the chain that is concerned only with getting you in and out.  Their prices are reasonable.  My wife and I continue to come back here when we are looking for a great sub and a great atmosphere.  Keep it up."}
{"text":"It's a toasted sub shop...and a good one at that.  Spend a little extra and get extra meat.  The fries aren't the best I've had but it sure beats potato chips.  The workers and management here have always been super nice...which is rare in the Chapel Hill area."}
{"text":"I am such a naive west coast boy growing up on Subway and Togo's.  Even when I arrived to the midwest, I somehow came to believe that Silver Mine was superior when sober, and Jimmy John's fantastic when drunk.  Then the arrival of Penn Station truly popped my sandwich cherry, big time.  If you have any of their super greasy, cheesy, toasted, stacked with meats subs, you'll know what i'm talking about.   QUESTION: how do they get their onions so super thin and delicious?  Definitely get the combo as the fries (skin attached) here are superb! If you are health conscious stay away from the larger combos with greasy cheese and meats as you WILL feel stuffed!"}
{"text":"Order was taken by Jory who was more concerned about taking a nap leaning up against register than he was taking the order.  3 of the 4 sandwiches were put in wrong and he failed to ask if was for here or to go.  So of course they started to prepare them as a for here order.  Watching the girl prep our food we were concerned that she wasn't wearing any gloves while preparing the food.  My order of fries was only 3/4 of the way full.  When it's $5 for an order of fries I prefer to get my money's worth.  Food was good although 3 of our party didn't get what they ordered."}
{"text":"I like Penn Station and their food but a quick lunch stop (11:20 on a Friday) before a 3 hour drive turned into a 45 minute visit waiting for a sandwich that they gave away to another customer. It's particularly frustrating to see person after person behind you in line get your food while you wait. None of the workers even knew that it was given away; there appears to be a communication problem between where your order is taken and where you pay perhaps.   I did get a coupon for a free sub, so I bumped my review from 2 to 3 stars."}
{"text":"These guys always toast their subs so that they're always nice and warm. They do sell a small selection of cold subs as well. The subs definitely taste great, but they don't taste so good at all when you store it in your fridge for later use (I tend to do this when I buy 12\" subs). Their 12\" subs cost $9-$10 making it hard for theme to compete with a place like Subway."}
{"text":"I haven't even received my food yet and feel the need to share my experience. The manager is loudly complaining to her crew members about their performance and took my order in an incredibly rude manner. It felt like she was yelling at me and used a very stern monotone voice. It's strange that she is choosing a career in customer service when she so clearly dislikes her fellow human beings."}
{"text":"love the fries!  there's maybe twice the size of mcds with the skins on them.  i tried them with ketchup and vinegar and really liked 'em.  i tried the italian which had everything i like, banana peppers, salami, oil, vinegar.  it seemed like a little food but boy did it fill me up!! i couldn't finish half the sammich and i can eat.  will go back."}
{"text":"Penn Stations subs are warm, cheesy and delicious.  I've eaten here twice and the only reason I don't eat here more often is because they're pricey.  When I first ate here, I was hungry, so I confidently ordered their largest sub.  It ended up being two subs - that's the large, LOL!  It was too much food to eat in one sitting.  The subs were fresh and huge, but they had a unique taste (maybe the grill) that I didn't find entirely appealing, thus the three stars.  Penn Station cuts fresh potatoes and fries em up to order.  Gotta love that!  I like Quizno's better.  http://www.penn-station.com/"}
{"text":"Sure can't find this quality of sandwich on the west coast where I'm from. I really have to say that I'm very surprised, one of the best Reuben sandwiches that I've EVER had! When I say EVER, I mean it!  This was probably the highlight of my trip to Illinois, not really but the best food I've had since I've been here."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a sub but wound up getting the Italian sausage which was really good. The bread they use is phenomenal! I ordered it without pizza sauce but after eating it I wish I had gotten a side of sauce. Regardless it was still very flavorful as is. They make fresh cut fries which were also good. I'll be going back to try more stuff for sure."}
{"text":"The people Who work at this location are the nicest. Seriously the most friendly group of people ever.   Service was fast and my sandwich was delicious. And of course the lemonade is bomb."}
{"text":"loved the Italian sub was not impressed with the fries that were over-cooked I have been here before and the fries were good - but I think they are now leaving them in the fryer too long!!"}
{"text":"Clean, neat, plenty of parking and fast, friendly service.  This has summed up my most recent visit.  When my husband and I brought our 2 boys here, it was completely dead.  We walked right up and gave them our order and within 7-8 minutes, we had a very hot and wonderful meal!  They even brought it out to the table we chose to sit at.  After eating, we took the boys to their restrooms and found it very clean and usable.  Nothing out of order.  I can't complain about this place."}
{"text":"Very clean, food is fresh, very friendly environment and the staff are always nice and neat looking. Im always greeted with a smile and the staff always wishes me a good day at work."}
{"text":"Penn station has the best cookies and the best Lemonade . Every visit I have made the staff is friendly etc ..."}
{"text":"Clean, pleasant people. But the sandwiches have a very high bread-to-filling ratio. Good fries, though -- made fresh, on the spot."}
{"text":"Everyone has their favorite flavor when it comes to subs.  Penn Station is up there with the best.  The bread's crust is not crunchy or even crisp - I don't like that style personally.  The toppings are generous and the flavors strong.  My wife gets the artichoke and mushroom.  Add an extra ounce of artichokes and wow, what a veggie sub.  I usually stick to the Italian.  Nice quality meats and the dressing is perfect.  The perfect blend of juiciness, greasiness, and herbs.  Yum.  Fries are only fried once you order.  GREAT real lemonade.  I also like the large selection of sizes to choose from so it's easy to adjust to your current hunger level.  Much better than most sub places."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff are always really friendly and super fast! During our last visit my boyfriend and I wanted to share a large sub and a small fry. We didn't mention that we were sharing because we don't like to be a pain and usually just divide our food ourselves. But when they brought it out, they'd separated our sub and fries evenly between two trays. It might just be something they do there, but we thought it was really awesome of them to do that for us without even asking. I'm always  greeted right away when I enter and wished a good day when I leave. Just a great crew and experience every visit!"}
{"text":"Delish cheese steak and they will make to order  share a fresh fry. So much food and who can go wrong with a fresh lemonade?"}
{"text":"I always go in there saying I'm going to try something new but then I always end up getting the club (add banana peppers). I am never disappointed with the club so why change it up? If it aint broke dont fix it! Penn Station also has AMAZING lemonade (coming from someone who doesn't even like lemonade). Fries and cookies are a must try too!"}
{"text":"Pretty good subs. If I compared these to anything, it'd be Quiznos, but I kind of think these are better. The portions are huge and not healthy by any means, but if you've got a hangover, here's your cure.  I'd give it more stars, but I simply don't think these sandwiches are mindblowing by any means, just very satisfying. Not to mention, the fries are pretty good."}
{"text":"Holy Dudes!!  This place reminds me of Senorita Bonita's, also in Solon.  Every time I go into either of these places dudes outnumber girls by a 4 to 1 ratio!!  I guess if you are a single girl either of these places would be a good place to hang out on your lunch hour??  Onto the food - which is pretty tasty.  I love their bread,  even though I'm positive it has zero nutritional value.  Hmm...maybe why that's because it's so yummy??  I have honestly never tried anything but the pizza sub.  Shame on me!!  But it is so goo-oood.  Especially if you add mushrooms and banana peppers.  Yuuuum.  Anyway, the artichoke sub looks really good too - but I'm sure I'll never try it!!  :-D  This place does get busy at lunch but they do their best to get you in and out!"}
{"text":"Food and service are good but on this occasion there was a minor mishap that could have been prevented.  There was a long hair on my sandwich.  The staff apologized and promptly made a replacement sandwich.  This is an opportunity for the staff to consider using hair nets or take other measures to avoid a repeat hair sandwich."}
