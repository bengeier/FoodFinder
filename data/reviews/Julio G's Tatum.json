{"text":"Burritooooooo lunch special!!!!! awesome, tons of chips and salsa"}
{"text":"Awesome place!  For a local neighborhood Mexican restaurant, Julio G's can't be beat!  The service is always consistent and good.  The staff is friendly and the food comes out WAY fast, which is good because then you don't have time to eat too many chips.  The have changed ownership in the last year or so and with that came some improvements.  I'm not sure where they are purchasing their meats but it has definitely improved.  The chicken especially.  I love the combo platter in the middle of the menu.  You can pick and choose and try out different items all served with rice and beans.  The green chile tamale is a favorite as are the fajitas and the Tijuana tacos!  The leftovers actually taste good too."}
{"text":"OK, so here's the deal, you're at PV Mall and it's lunchtime. You go to the food court and see that Paradise Bakery is the only decent choice but that's where you ate the last 47 times you were here. Easy solution, get in your car and drive across Tatum to Julio G's. The chips and salsa are free, plentiful, and delicious. The menu has all the standard Mexican menu items and are reasonably priced. Everything I've tried here was OK. Not, \"OMG\", but OK. Service has also been fine. Note, the portions are huge! I've never been able to finish my entree but maybe it's because I go through two baskets of chips."}
{"text":"The food here is and has been, for many years, overwhelmingly meh. Yeah, just meh. Pollo Diablos, veggie enchiladas, and taco salads were our orders and everyone agreed that they were all very...meh. The service was good and the restaurant was clean but the food is really so average and one-dimensional."}
{"text":"Love it. The salsa may not be the best but the Pollo Magnifico makes up for it. Order this dish people it is fantabulous! It is a deep fried chicken burro topped with jalapeno cream cheese (to die for) and tons of melted cheese. I order this dish every single time and although I know it is not good for my diet I cannot resist it.  The Pollo Magnifico never lets me down each time it is delicious and melts in my mouth!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant on a regular basis for a few years now. The food is always fresh, hot and served promptly. I like the hot sauce and salsa that come with the chips. I typically get a la carte items but tried the Pollo Diablo entree my last visit. This is probably my new favorite!  It's a laid back crowd, family friendly and enjoy the satellite radio. Everyone who works here has a great rapport with customers and respect each other as well. Hard to find in restaurants these days. Our servers have always been attentive and pleasant to deal with in every aspect. Rod the night manager is very personable and  friendly. Those who gave it an A-Ok rating should try again."}
{"text":"Been here for years.  They have the BEST NACHOS in Phoenix.  If you're in the mood for a huge helping of chips, cheese, jalapenos, and all the rest, this is the place to come! This is all I ordered and could not eat anything else for hours."}
{"text":"This place is great, highly recommended the spinach queso enchiladas.  Seated right away, attentive service and has a separate  to go pick up area if you just want to pick up on the way home"}
{"text":"The service is excellent but the food is no where near authentic Mexican food.  We would never go back!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Julio G's for at least 3 years. I totally disagree with Nikki Jo about their Salsa.  I really like the flavor of the mild Salsa and besides its Free and we love their Chips too. The hosts are always helpful and friendly even when we have to wait for a table. Service and Food has always been terrific and we have introduced alot of friends to Julio's and have never heard a complaint from any of them. If anyone loves cheese the way I do, try the Pollo Loco lunch or dinner and the Loco Pie is great to split with friends. We really enjoy going to Julio's and they offer a Great Happy Hour not just in their bar. When I think about I would have to say it is our Favorite Mexican Restaurant."}
{"text":"Good fresh food. Reasonable price. Food comes out quickly. Service is normal good but not WOW of course it takes a lot to WOW me! Looks like it can get quite crowded!  Love the rice! :-)"}
{"text":"Candy, the server on we had on Father's Day was EXCELLANT!!@@@ I plan to return to the restaurant as service was GRADE A.  More restaurants need to have service like Julio G's. X"}
{"text":"Normally when you go to a mexican rest. you order a margarita and it's just OK. Not the case here. Julio G's has the best drinks we've had at a mexican rest in the area. Reasonably priced too! (Would recommend the pitcher, it makes sense if you're having more than one drink).  We're big fans of the mexican pizza with jalapenos and cream cheese too. It's enough to feed 2-3 people, and def fills you up. If I could make one change, it would be the chips and salsa that's brought out before your meal. They aren't anything to brag about, and maybe a mean dip could replace one of the 3 salsas to switch things up."}
{"text":"Phenomenal customer service by Connor. We went in there tonight to grab a bite about 5 minutes to close, and Connor was very polite, helpful, and friendly. He didn't seem bothered we were there so late, as many places typically do near close, and made sure we would be comfortable. He was extraordinary! Best service ever received from a type of restaurant such as this.   He even came out to the patio and took our dirty plates to the trash for us when we were finished. He asked if we needed drinks or salsa before he closed them down. Superior service! He's going to go places in life."}
{"text":"I had the Pollo Diablo, formerly named Pollo Magnifico.  They renamed it because they added more cream cheese, so calling it Diablo would give it that extra edge.  Apparently this burro wasn't enough of an artery clogger just yet.  I didn't know what to get so I decided to get what the Yelp review highlights recommended.  Unfortunately it is not always clear if those highlights are for a positive or negative review of the dish. My quick scan indicated that Pollo Magnifico/Diablo was a good thing, so I went with that.    Pollo Diablo is a deep-fried chicken burro drowning in jalapeno cream and cheese, served with a side of beans and rice.  I took one look at the thing and felt myself getting full and bloated already.  The fried touch made it not quite crispy, just a little greasy.  The inside was tender but hard to really pay attention to with all of the jalapeno cream and cheddar cheese everywhere. I was overwhelmed and ate less than half the entree.  Nothing worth taking with me, either.  The worst part about eating here is that we all just got tired from eating.  They are big, heavy portions.  I looked over at my cousin and his head was propped up in his hands, his eyes drooping.  My sister's tamale was basically a hunk of really heavy and dry cornbread and she was exhausted from eating, too.  This was heavy stuff.  I'm not from the Southwest so maybe I just don't know any better, but for this California girl, I would much rather  eat Mexican food in a dirty hole in the wall in San Jose than to come back here."}
{"text":"Love the chips and salsa but I think they need a little more variety. However, they make up for it with some other great options for lunch. The #9 is my go to though.."}
{"text":"A first time visit.  We liked the food.  I had the chimichanga machaca, my wife had the combo enchilada plate.  The server we had was very attentive and did a very good job.  Two suggestions for the owner of this restaurant.  1.  Your tortilla chips are very tasty but they are far to small to use for dipping, etc.  Keep the same recipe but have them made larger.  We noticed that too many of them are broken so that by the time you get 1/2 way through the bowl all you have is fragments.  Larger chips would eliminate this problem.  2.  Your hot water in the men's room is too hot!  You are wasting energy and paying for it, plus you could end up scalding someone.  We will be back, however, because the food is very good."}
{"text":"Usually I would give them a five, however, last night my husband and I went in around 4:30 for an early dinner and couldn't get seated. Not because they were busy, but because the hostess/waitress that was hiding behind the wall chose to ignore us. We could see her watching us in the bar mirror, and she even made eye contact with my husband. After waiting about 10 min we decided to eat at another restaurant. I really dislike being ignored, so I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"needed a mexican food fix . i had a chicken enchilada that filled the bill.."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for years and I can honestly say it has been going downhill for the past few years. The food quality has slid from good to just down right bad (Taco Bell Quality) The last time I was there the service was just just awful. I am so disappointed I use to love this place now I can't wait for another Mexican food restaurant to open so I don't have to go all the way over to Valley Luna on Cave Creek Rd for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"We were extremely disappointed with our visit. The place looks like it was styled for the late 80's, but we tried to look past that since we were pretty hungry.  While the service was alright, the kitchen seemed to have hit a snag and we waited for our food for 30-45 minutes. All the tables around us all seemed to have to same issue. The food was bland and heavy in onions and peppers. Rice was the typical bland rice with peas, not very fresh or noteworthy. I had the carnitas tacos and my husband had a chimichanga. We both left feeling disappointed and wishing it was so much more.  We didn't get a chance to check out any margaritas, but wish we did since the water tasted funny... Almost moldy?  Glad we checked out the local place, but disappointed it wasn't better."}
{"text":"Great Margaritas,  delicious food and awesome service.  Our server Melissa was super nice and on top of it and prices were good.  I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great service! Great food! Delicious salsa! Came here with my family and three kids- they loved the fajitas. Very clean and friendly staff also."}
{"text":"Julio's has been our go-to Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale for almost twenty years. The location at PV always has consistently good food. Their salsa and spinach con queso dip are the best in town! The service is always spot on and everyone is so attentive there. Connor is now one of our favorite servers. He is so pleasant and personable. He pays attention to detail and truly seems like he cares about all of his customers."}
{"text":"Food was just okay. Restaurant was empty but waiter never bothered to check on us or ask how our meals were. Adios Julio G"}
{"text":"Older male Manager is rude, sarcastic and argumentative.   My family and I have been coming here for years. More recently one to two times a week with my father and my kids. We get the same thing every time. Number 5 on the lunch menu, taco with enchilada and two cheese quesadillas. Today there was a small hiccup with the price, the cashier was new and the manager easily fixed it. This is where it all went wrong.   The manager began telling me the lunch prices went up. Ok, no problem I can pay $8.49 for my number 5. Then he proceeds to tell me it's impossible that I have ordered it for two years. He states he added it two weeks ago and I'm lying. He did not state this in private, he said this in front of people in the take out line. I told him that wasn't true I have been ordering it and his employee Chris knows my family and knows our order.   The manager only seemed to get more upset and continue to say I wasn't telling the truth. The manager was sarcastic, and while walking into the main dining room said \"Well you ought to know! I wouldn't know!\"   The behavior was ridiculous and embarrassing. Having a \"bad day\" wouldn't even justify this behavior. We were the first customers in the building and several were in the restaurant while this was happening. After all the years it's safe to safe we have no intentions of ever coming back to this establishment to eat."}
{"text":"Enjoy the food ... get here early on Fridays,  after 7pm it's busy ... friendly staff though  This is my go to spot!"}
{"text":"I'd love to review the food but after waiting over 15 minutes for someone to take out order, we left. 3 in the afternoon. Nearly empty. Sad."}
{"text":"We uses to live just around the block from this place and enjoyed meals, as well as margaritas, here quite often.  We were back on this side of town and decided to call some friends to meet us for a bite.  We were sat immediately and the staff has ALWAYS been great and today was no exception!  We were taken care of by Chris and he did a phenomenal job! Our drinks never went empty, the chips and salsa remained full and he was always there with a smile and questioning if there was anything we needed.  The food was even better than I remembered and I can forsee my wife asking to go back soon just by how much she enjoyed her meal.  It is very reasonably priced and you never leave hungry!  Our friends hadn't been here in quite awhile either and they commented as we were leaving...\"why don't we ever think of coming here ourselves?\"  (I think they will be back soon as well ;) )"}
{"text":"I love this place...for the AWESOME margaritas!  OMG, one of those and I can't remember what the food tastes like.  All I know is the leftovers are pretty damn good for the next day's breakfast."}
{"text":"So sad, I remember eating at this place when they had a location near ASU and had fond memories of it- perhaps it's just the expertise of that location or the lack of maturity in my taste buds. This place is not good and a disappointment with the memories I had of it and how easy it is to get to from my new home.   The chips and salsa was the first sign that this isn't what I remember. They give you two salsas in which both had not a lot of flavor and I ended up mixing them. The mix helped but overall if the chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant are bland it means the rest of the meal will be. And I was right..   I ordered a red chile burrito and upon cutting it up the phrase \"canned meat smell\" went through my mind. The sauce lacked that smokey heat you expect in a red chili sauce, it had little to no flavor and had an overcooked texture to it. I kept eating because I was hungry, but then my BF said it looked like dog food and I had to stop eating. It did remind me of dog food because his not polite table etiquette connected with my first initial thought about the meal- canned smell.   My BF ordered a mix of al carte tacos and he had the same unimpressed feeling, and stopped eating halfway through his meal.   The two stars was for the service, our waitress was awesome and let us know that ordering a pitcher of margaritas would save us a few bucks. The Margarita, which I would consider the 'House Margarita' quench my craving for a margarita. It said it was award winning, which I don't think it was anything amazing, but it did it's job.   Overall, I won't go back as the food was overall not good and there are too many other great Mexican places to go to."}
{"text":"So far it's been one of the better food places I've found since coming to the area for work. I ordered the combo, Tamale with green sauce and the chicken taco with rice and beans. Rice completely fell flat, beans were ok. The chicken taco could use a little flavor, but the Tamale.....it's the best thing on the menu. My family makes home made Tamales every year and this year I'm not at home. This Tamale made up for it. It had a lot of flavor and the masa was sweet like my grandmother makes them. Definitely made the plate!"}
{"text":"Julio G's is one of my favorite Mexican haunts in the valley. I've been coming to this location since before it was even Julio G's (RIP Marilyn's). Julio G's has great food and a cool atmosphere (or maybe I'm just a sucker for neon). For any first timers, I recommend the Pollo Diablo. Whatever you get, don't forget to add a side of jalapeño cream cheese. The fajitas are also very good."}
{"text":"Great personal service!  Melissa, Will & Chris always give great service!!   We have been eating here for about 5 years, and the food is always good.    Great green chili chicken enchiladas & beef tacos!!  Great take out too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for the past 4 years.  The food and service has always been great.  My husband enjoys the beef tacos and fajitas.  I enjoy the chicken chimichanga and pollo diablo. And we must get a frozen margarita to go with our food = yummy.  We love the food here so much, we visit at least 3 times a month.    Melissa, our typically assigned waitress (she is always there) knows what we like.  And even when it gets busy, she always makes time to chat with us.  Love her!!   Prices are awesome, food is delicious and service has always been good to us.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because the server was nice/quick and the rice and salsa were decent. However, I will never eat here again.  We came for lunch on a Sunday- ordered kids enchilada and Diablo Chicken (similar to Carlos O Briens' fundido).  The kids enchilada was not tasty, at all (of course I always try my toddlers food, duh).  The sauce was .... just gross.  The chicken in the Diablo was meh.  The main course was nothing special & incomparable.  The worst parts about this lunch were the beans & awful stomach ache we both had within 40 mins of leaving.  The beans were crusted... obviously sitting for a long time and just scooped out of the pan onto the plate.  I *hate* to be wasteful, but we threw away most of the food.  And whatever was in the food.... our stomachs couldn't handle it.  Don't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This place is a shell of it's former self...Poor food, and even worse management.  Overhead the manager drop the F bomb a few times!  Pretty classy in front of customer.  The food has no flavor, place is exceptionally loud and rundown.  Don't ever order the beef fajitas here!  What a joke!  No flavor and no one uses cheap flavorless round steak for fajitas.  Takes lessons from Fajitas out on I-17, and try again.  I won't be back!!"}
{"text":"It's your standard TexMex.  Tasty, but nothing to write home about.  Got the flautas (average) and the pollo loco enchilada. (cheesy and good) Regulation rice & beans.   The salsa & chips were good. But listen, avoid the \"hot\" salsa. It's not.  It's a smooth salsa with loads of chili powder added to spice it up. It doesn't."}
{"text":"While my husband and I love the food, we have discovered something very disturbing while dining at Julio G's Tatum. Our receipts have shown that Julio G's rounds up your bill, resulting in a greater charge than what you ate/drank. For example, our bill was this: Subtotal $30.37 + $2.61 tax = Sub w/tax $32.98, AMT DUE: $33.00. Where did that extra 2 cents come from? To us, 2 cents is not a problem, but it is if every check from every table rounds up, too! We decided to try eating there again, and our bill was this: Subtotal $26.18 + $2.25 tax = Sub w/tax $28.43, AMT DUE: $28.45. Again, 2 more cents charged than the actual bill. Now, it's a pattern. I decided to ask a manager, and he said that is the way their system calculates tax. I have never seen that before with any other dining experience, so beware that you are most likely being skimmed when you dine with Julio G's."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this location for the first time this week. I had been to the other location in Scottsdale, (Indian School rd.) many times, with mixed, yet overall favorable reviews. While it must be stated that this isn't going to satisfy the Mexican food connoisseur, I found this place to be pretty enjoyable, and a good value to boot! I had a machaca burrito, enchilada style for $7.50, and it was HUGE! Came with the standard rice and beans and small salad. Wifey had an enchilada plate, also the same price, and she couldn't finish half of it! Very colorful place, clean, and great service. Nice place for small groups and families. Pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Love it here!!  Food is great and Kasey at the bar is amazing. I recommend for sure. They will help you pick out items if you're vegetarian!  Kasey makes a MAD margarita!!!"}
{"text":"Glad La Parrilla Suiza was Closed- or we wouldn't have found this GEM. Husband had Pollo Diablo and I had the chicken taco & machaca enchilada. Cheese crisp as an appetizer filled us up.  Our waitress, Kasey was wonderful. Only regret. We live 3 hours from the restaurant :("}
{"text":"Thought my carnitas was on the dry side but the chips/salsa were delish and my strawberry marg was freaking strong.  It was really difficult to Christmas shop afterwards."}
{"text":"Lunch specials are very affordable and the chicken burro always knocks it out of the park with huge chunks of white meat chicken and enchilada sauce slathered on top. I get double rice instead of beans and the total for this giant meal is about 8 bucks. They give you free chips and your choice of hot or mild salsa. I always get this to go and it's nearly impossible not to eat it all due to quality. Dieters beware."}
{"text":"Well I opted for the cheeseburger plate with fris and salad for $8.50 that was suppose to have montery jack but was delivered with yellow (American I think) cheese.  Same for the other burger at our table and the beef burrito a la cart at our table looked dry and was I was told.  This was my first visit and we came for lunch and sat on the patio. The chips and salsa were good. The softdrinks are big and you get refills which is good since they are $2.35 each!  But looking at the other plates with mexican food it looked good and smelled wonderful! The staff was reasonaly nice.    They have a small bar but the special drinks are HIGH at $7 & $8!  It was a pricey lunch with tip I spent $14.   Still I might try a mexican meal one day because it smells so good!"}
{"text":"It would rate 5 stars except for the damn lighting.   Please change pink neon out.   We love it but can not dine there as the lighting is ghastly.   We hit it every couple years instead of a couple of times a month.   Went back and the lighting is still painful.   Beyond painful.     On this last visit my wife had the veggie fajitas and the had the bad lighting enchiladas.   Food was very tasty.   Service great."}
{"text":"Love this place! Margaritas are delicious, and the servers are always friendly and accomodating. I also enjoy that they recently added more seafood dishes to their menu. Chicken spinach enchiladas and nachos are among my favorites. Glad to have this restaurant in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Right in the neighborhood, but I keep forgetting about it.  Good 'classic' Mexican food (the kind you grew up with in the 70s/80s).  Eat the chips and salsa (try the hot salsa) Order the Chile Relleno with rice and beans. Eat. Be happy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is outstanding.  Great food, great servers, and I am always pleased with my meal.  In addition, their prices are incredibly reasonable. My food is always hot and delicious.  Happy hour prices are amazing as well.  I wish this restaurant was closer to my home, I would eat there more often. I would give it 10 stars if I could."}
{"text":"They heat their chips. This always starts me off in a good mood at a Mexican restaurant, as well as a good margarita when I feel like drinking. Their salsa tasted like it was out of a jar or made with ingredients that came out of a jar and had some fresh cilantro in it to freshen it up. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. Their margaritas were very good and on special when we went. I ordered the chili rellano, beef taco and cheese enchilada.  The rellano tasted like it had been frozen. We asked the server and he said fresh, but mu taste buds disagreed. The taco was just OK. Beef was seasoned and reminded me of a generic Taco Bell hard shell taco.The enchilada was good.   I would go back only if my friends who brought me here wanted to go again."}
{"text":"Julio G's has the BEST Pollo Fundido in the city of Phoenix! !  (Only they call it Pollo Magnifico) they catered my son's wedding and everyone agreed!  Love that they use high quality ingredients, and use only chicken breast meat in their food!  Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Service was not bad. Food was just not good. The best thing was the rice. Got spinach chicken enchiladas, beef tacos, and a red tamale. Spinach was either frozen or canned because the mushy slimy texture ruined it for me. Taco wasn't too bad. The chips and salsa came and while the chips weren't too bad the salsa tasted like chili picante. Won't waste my money here again since it was pricy!"}
{"text":"I've finally been there enough times to realize that I don't like it.   The beans are bland and the rice is salty. The salsa isn't right, either. They have all of the typical tacos, enchiladas, and other stuff you'll find in a similar Mexican place, it's just not as good.  The service is sub-par. I've noticed that the bussers do their thing right; refilling water, cleaning up, etc. The servers are happy to take their time with everything and leave you hanging.  The last few times I went to this place, it was the decision of someone else. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Don't bring families. Very unwelcoming. The staff ignores people with kids. This didn't even happen to us but rather a family we witnessed be treated this way. We'll never come back."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for over 12 years, but the place has been on the downhill slide for years.  They closed the location on indian school years ago, for the same reasons.  Those reasons are many now. I stopped back in after being away from Julio G's Take out.  Had 2 beef tacos and rice....  The rice is very plain and has gotten more gringo over the years  which equals bland.  The taco's had a nice shredded beef filling and was better than 2 years ago.  But the salsa bar has been reduced to salsa given out on plastic topped cups.  Bad news is you have to ask for more all the time if you like the sauce, the hot is far from hot any gringo can use it.  Bad news one person taking orders during lunch service in take out and service said orders.  Cleanup needs to be focused on here... They have forgotten to do this.  Yes, a long term customer is seeing another location in slow spiral down the drain."}
{"text":"Your standard Sonoran style Mexican. You know, everything covered in cheese. I got the green chile rellenos. The green chiles had no flavor, I think they were in a can too long. Anyway, nothing special, I think its just a place for people to drink."}
{"text":"This is a really great Mexican food restaurant! My aunt brought me here for the fist time. Laid back atmosphere, awesome food, wonderful food, and fantastic service - Thanks Connor! Highly recommend this neighborhood gem, the seafood chile relleno, carnitas tacos, and seafood tacos. Yum!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin. It's been years that I've been to this restaurant I regionally used to go to the one on Scottsdale Road east of Indian school. The service was great the atmosphere was nice and clean but the food was horrible! My complaint is I order the green corn tamale with sauce I saw no sauce but dried up cheese on it the tamale was dry, horrible! When I go back absolutely not the rice and beans or a OK but I really wish they would work on adding sauce to their tamale so wouldn't be so damn dried up."}
{"text":"Great Salsa!  While driving down Cactus we had a sudden craving for Mexican food and stopped at the first place we found.   We were seated immediately and had wonderful service, I saved the receipt so I could remember to put her name in my review but I can't find it. Once I do...I'll let ya know!  We had a slew of folks that helped bring drinks, chips, salsa and everything else that we needed. I was pretty impressed with the level of service we received.   The ONLY downfall is not having an Italian dressing that's not creamy. No one likes creamy dressing. Please get a true vinaigrette  on your menu. I loved your taco salad but didn't have a good dressing to put on it. I promise to add this to my roatation if you do."}
{"text":"I ordered the cheese enchiladas with a side of rice and beans. They really skimped on the sides and the food was super oily. I didn't notice the oil while I was eating, but I ended up getting sick later that night. Not eating here again."}
{"text":"Yummy Mexican food! I've been going here for years and I love almost everything on the menu. Bill and Casey are great to have when dinning in, they always know what to recommend! Great service."}
{"text":"It hit the spot.   7:30 on a Friday night, three of us wanted a few old favorites from the good old days back in downtown Scottsdale, and were pleasantly surprised. Not stellar, modern cooking, but everything was reliable, quick, and cheap, and we lucked in and got the empty booth. After us, it got a little backed up waiting for a table.  Our cheese crisp was simple and yet perfect. Crisped on the bottom, but not scorched, the generous, even topping of cheese was just melted and rushed to our table hot. Simple, cheap, good.  Our Carnitas were caramelized on the outside, and moist on the inside. Not overly salted, nicely spiced. Not the best I've ever had, but better than the last 3 or 4 iterations I have had in a restaurant.  A couple of mixed plates were very well received, and we really liked the black beans.  And our large pitcher of Texas Margaritas- on the rocks, had a great balance of orange liqueuer, lime, and Sauza, and were pretty darn pleasant for $26, with two hefty drinks apiece. Once again, not the very best margarita ever, but as good as many in very respected high concept Mexican restaurants around the US- and frankly a little better balance than a few of those. Certainly way better drinks than Los Dos Molinos' and I still love that place anyway.  Our server was great, and she accommodated all our whims, so thats rare.  Three of us walked out stuffed, tipsy, and very satisfied for about $70."}
{"text":"Did Yelp Delivery for the first time tonight since I'm on business travel & did not want to eat at a restaurant. Food is okay... delivery was awful. I had special instructions on the delivery that was something easy like \"include itemized receipt\" did not get that & did not get the basics either. Fork, spoon, knife, & napkins ... I even let them know I was at a hotel! Yes there are utensils at a hotel, but I didn't get delivery so I could go anywhere else! Like c'mon!! Making me eat like a savage! I thought I was nice to include a tip, but the service was not worth it. Maybe it is better inside the restaurant?"}
{"text":"We had a disappointing dinner at Julio G's and probably won't go back. Our waitress was not prompt and it took a long time to get our drinks (water and one margarita) and our food was not good either. The chicken in my spinach and chicken enchilada was rubbery and the tortillas were not cooked thoroughly. My husband's dinner was not good either. I'm not sure why there has been a change in the quality of the service and food. We have eaten at Julio G's in the past and it was great but this last experience might have just been the end of our Julio G's visits. :("}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner. Diner ambiance, interesting.. Mirrors everywhere which was kinda neat. Wait staff nothing special, but not terrible. Large portions. We ordered a pitcher of margarita... Standard but not strong at all. With that said, some of the best Mexican food in the area. Although... I ordered the borracho shrimp and was a little disappointed (shrimp ratio to price: 7 : $15.) but the mucho chimis and more was awesome!!! Worth the price and more than we could finish! Best corn tamale I've had!  Recommend it if you want good Mexican and a casual atmosphere"}
{"text":"I went to this location for the first time yesterday. The service was very friendly and fast. I ordered the burro with spinach queso, one of the lunch specials. While the food is decent I wouldn't say it is fantastic. There are just so many really really good Mexican restaurants in the area. I thought the salsa that came with the chips tasted like jar salsa from the grocery store. Julio G's just didn't \"wow\" me but the food was decent and the lunch prices were pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"Great food, and good service. Ordered a chicken chimichanga and was tasty. Chips were served hot, salsa had a good flavor. I mixed the 2 served. Finished off with fried ice cream and was delicious. Cute atmosphere & front window opens to patio to enjoy Arizona's nice fall weather.  Prices are reasonable as well. The only reason I didn't rate a 5 was due to my chimichanga not being as crispy as I am use to. Still very good."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are fantastic...that's what keeps bringing us back.  This is my one year olds favorite restaurant as she loves the salsa.  The food is pretty good...I have to admit it's not the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it's always consistently good."}
{"text":"The worst Mexican ever felt the quality was better at Taco Bell. This is not Mexican. My food was cold and bad tasting."}
{"text":"We live near Julio G's, so we go there about once a month. We've never had a bad meal, and the service has always been above average!  I highly recommend the cactus margarita! I always end up taking home half my dinner because the portions are big and we eat way too many chips and salsa before the food comes!"}
{"text":"I am typically a pretty understanding customer and realize that with anything mistakes on orders can happen.  Last night I placed a take out order and ordered the super nachos and only wanted beans cheese and sour cream.  I have gotten this order once a week for the last month and never and I do mean never have they ever put green chillis in the cheese.    After getting home last night when I found that the order had the chillis I asked them to correct it.  The cashier was accomadating but the owner was very rude to my wife and I and lied to ou faces saying that is what they always do.  I informed him of how often we come to his business and he still did not show any concern for us. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING their and they lost a customer for life."}
{"text":"this place is great as always.  allyson was super nice and on top of everything.  food always taste good and salsa is great. the fajitas should have a bit more chicken for the money tho."}
{"text":"I love this place, simply because of the freshness of the food and the care they take in making the food.  Also, the BEST Mexican food value around!  I know it's a lot of \"old school\" Mexican fare, but it's all so good.  They probably could use a few more spicy offerings, though.  Have a nice Christmas tree,too"}
{"text":"Julio G's is a great place to go after shopping at PV Mall or with relatives. It is similar to chain restaurants, but with fewer locations, the quality is pretty consistent. I like the shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service!!  They have delicious house margaritas that are like $4 on happy hour. Good salsa,  amazing Ranchero beans and if you go there make sure to ask for Melissa.  She is an amazing server."}
{"text":"Appetizers were average, service was good, chips and salsa was below average. Price was Ok Wife was more impressed with the drinks I am not a drinker"}
{"text":"Went there last night after a bad experience with another resteraunt. Food was great as always,server was great,and my drink was never empty. As good as it gets.   My Daughters favorite resteraunt, and one of my top five out of all food types.     Never had a bad experience at any otheir locations"}
{"text":"The food was very heavy. Did not sit well in my stomach. Their salsa on the other hand, their salsa was very watery...didn't even sit on the chips....just the cilantro stayed on the chips after each dip. Sorry to say, but I will not be returning any time soon :("}
{"text":"Best green chili pork in Arizona. Tender, tasty and no fat."}
{"text":"Living keto, we love Mexican food and Julio G's made it happen.   Nachos without chips and beans, fajitas and veggies....Yum.  the waiter was helpful and made sure our order was correct.   Great flavor and value..."}
{"text":"Mini chimis are a YES. Staff is sooo nice. Drinks are super reasonable and they always ask if you need anything at all. Ask for extra sauce or a refill and it's done before you ask. Love JG's!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just moved into the area and my taco craving brought me to this place. I ordered a soup to go  and a taco! The bartender said while handing me my soup \"it's going to be soggy they put the tortillas in there\". She then handed me a bill that had 2 soups on it. She said she already charged my card and would need to charge again. I was so aggravated I spoke to a manager who proceeded to tell me she is very busy. I was shocked at the lack of customer service these people had. It was horrible. Chris the \"manager\" charged my card for the 3rd time! I told him I was extremely disappointed and would Never come back. He didn't care. How can a place charge you 3 times and give you soggy soup somehow make it like you're in the wrong. I would go somewhere else before going To this place. What a bad experience. I'll take my business elsewhere. Don't go to this place! Very very disappointed. The manager didn't even offer me another soup after I complained."}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant. Looking for a quick and easy lunch and found Julio's on my phone. The place was packed for Saturday lunch, but the guys at reception were very helpful after we explained our desire for a quick lunch fix. We choose the bar, and had great service from very friendly servers. Food was very good. Will look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"We first tried this place late last year, it's right down the street from our condo and we were itching to break away from the norm and try a new place.  I am always thinking I might find the next \"it\" place that no one else has discovered. I know Julio's has been around for awhile but I had never heard anything good/bad about it.  It probably didn't help the start to our dining expierience that an ex-manager/co-worker came into the dining area when were first sat down. Let's just say I pretty much disagreed with this person on every aspect of life and leave it at that.   Service was slow, very slow. It was a lazy Sunday and place was not even half full. They finally brought the meal and it was wrong, we waited another 20-25 min and I think part of it was wrong again. I don't even remember what we got it was so forgettable. Just blah, it provided some calories and nothing more. Everything was just bland an so-so.   I gave them 2 stars instead of one because they did comp our entire bill. I felt somewhat bad for the waiter so I left him a big tip and got out of there, so much for trying a new place."}
{"text":"Get the beef fajitas and request the macho sauce."}
{"text":"One of our FAVORITE joints to eat at.  BEST chips in salsa in the Valley in my opinion.  Casual eatery, GREAT food (I only like Manuel's better...all other casual Mexican food restaurants don't compare).  Their frozen strawberry margaritas are DEEEE-LISH.  We used to live in south Scottsdale & frequented \"the\" Julio G's down there and the Julio's Too for takeout, and although this location isn't as unique in decor & ambience, it definitely is the same wonderful food & friendly staff."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and the chicken Diablo salad I got was pretty tasty. However, something about the texture of the chicken was off putting and slightly rubbery. It didn't taste bad, it just was a texture I'm not a big fan of...  Hubby got the fajitas which wasn't sizzling when it came out which is a bummer because who doesn't love the sound of that sizzling piping hot skillet with yumminess? The fajitas tasted good, evidenced by his clean plate :)  Otherwise, great service, overall good food and good happy hour prices. Solid place of come for Mexican but don't expect the salsa to be spicy :("}
{"text":"My husband and I always enjoy eating at Julio G's. The queso dip is the best.  And our absolute favorite is the Pollo Diablo fried extra crispy!  We love taking people here who are visiting from out of town and so far everyone loves it.  The restuarant stays busy with customers and I have never had to wait for a table.  I always enjoy my servers.  They always polite and informative.  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This was a fun restaurant.  The pitcher of margaritas was very tasty. We were promptly given chips and 2 kinds of salsa upon arrival. One salsa was quite mild and the other was the burn your mouth type. They were both very good. I ordered the chili relleno and my husband ordered carnitas tacos. The food was good. I enjoyed it. I'm not sure that my husband was ecstatic about his meal. He usually eats all of his tacos, but he kind of picked at them this time. My chili relleno was very cheesy. It wasn't crispy, but then I don't find very many of them that are. I think the food was fairly good. I think the service was very good and the restaurant appeared nice and clean. They deserve a strong 4 stars. I would go back to eat there again."}
{"text":"My two kids and I ate at the Julio G's quick counter service area for lunch today. We had the sampler platter which was really good and more than enough to feed all three of us. Chips and salsa were great, service was friendly. Where else can you get a nice Mexican lunch for $10 for three people? We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"They have great prices on margarita pitchers and such yummy food. Quick service too! Try their mini Chili's and the pollo magnifeco!"}
{"text":"I ordered from eat 24 and in my notes I said \"no beans or sour cream on anything in my order\", I even ordered a la crate for that reason, and everything came with beans :("}
{"text":"Disappointing salsa, my server was terrible and obviously in a crappy mood, it took forever for my food to come and I had to leave before I was done eating because there was no ac in the restaurant and I felt like I was going to pass out. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent veggie fajitas! Amazing guac, really good food all around! Would recommend."}
{"text":"Honestly...   Food was not great.   I had better at Taco Bell.   Chips were pretty good...  Salsa horrible.   Customer service was descent although our waiter got mine and my friend's orders wrong."}
{"text":"So this is a place I'll come back to -- if other people want to go.  Meaning our experience was okay, with no big failures to keep me away, but I wasn't blown away by the food either.  The chips were good, if under salted, and the salsa's were alright.  The anathema I feel for cilantro means I'll ask for an alternative if all salsas include it.  They chopped up some fresh tomato, onion and jalapeño for me even though the hottest salsa was cilantro-free. This was actually one of the highlights - and much appreciated.  My chili relleno was very cheesy and beef enchilada pretty standard.  Filling and acceptable, though I agree with some other reviews that mention under-seasoned dishes.  The wife had a shredded beef taco and chicken enchilada which she was happy with.  The virgin strawberry margarita was freshly blended and completely finished by wifey - while my \"Julios Margarita\" on the rocks was your standard marg - tasty and sour and reasonably poured.  So we left - tummies filled, wallet appropriately dented, having been pleasantly served (if a little slow at the start given the very few late diners, but the speed the food came out made up for it)."}
{"text":"After years of enjoying this place, from Camelback road to here, I will never go back.  The waiter took 10 minutes to return our Visa, the place was empty, so we asked the mgr what was the holdup. He lost his temper so badly! \"Are you accusing my staff of stealing?\" he asked us. We expected him to say, \"hold on and I'll go check on it\" not to go off on us for a reasonable question.  Our jaws dropped.  He was so nasty and borderline unstable. He invited us to never come back, thought we were on Punked.  God forbid someone actually complain, he might throw them out. Still waited longer for the credit card after that.  We were too stunned to ask to see another mgr, just left in shock.  Bad attitude and average food, skip it. Too many nice business owners to give hard earned money."}
{"text":"As others have pointed out, the salsa is terrible.  I got creative and utilized my inner chef using ingredients available at the table, such as salt, lime wedges, and different types of salsa they brought me.  Despite my trying to \"improve\" the salsa, I failed.  I don't think there was anything that could make that quasi pizza sauce better.  Because I was then so desperate for decent salsa, I was conned into thinking I could order the \"diablo\" salsa which would be an upgrade, and it wasn't.    I felt disgusted with myself for eating over 1,500 calories, especially on such bad mexican food.  For what it's worth though, my girlfriend's tijuana tacos were decent, but not great.  It's also expensive for the crummy food (think Chevy's), and like others have pointed out, you feel like you're at Cafe 50's minus the blue plate special.  The lighting was tres obnoxious.    One flauta for over $5?  C'mon.  Never again.  You'll be more satsified at Filibertos."}
{"text":"This must be the place that seasonings forgot... I came here last night with two others. I had been there before but it had been years  and I don't recall anything about that experience.This trip however was just as the rating implies: \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Our server was friendly, but not personable. Some people just aren't, and that's ok. The chips and salsa were great, I really enjoyed them. I wish their spicy salsa was spicier though. We started with an order of chips and guacamole. I don't think anything was added to the avocado. Maybe some diced up tomato? I could be wrong, but it really just tasted like mashed up avocado and a slight touch of lemon maybe? Probably more to keep it from turning brown, than for flavor. But there was no, or at least very little, salt and pepper. Our entrees came out shortly after and it was the same story. Everything looked delicious, but was really lacking in flavor. I had the nachos with ground beef which I would usually love anywhere else but was very unimpressed.  This was just \"meh\","}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times because friends were already there and talked me into meeting them there. I have never really thought much of the food but it was not bad enough to write a review about. How bad can you mess up mexican food? But recently I dined at Julio G's and the experience was enough to inspire me to share.  First of all the decor has always bothered me there.  Pink Neon reminds me of some 50's diner.   I always expect to see a Milk Shake on the Menu when I sit down.  Also on this must recent visit I had really poor service. It was only slightly busy but it took an inordinate about of time to get a simple combo dish out.    They thing that stuck me most about Julio G's was how expensive it was.  Nothing on the menu was less then $11 for a combo dish.  Actually I think a 2 item combo was like $10.95 and a 3 Item was like $11.95.  Man, $12 bucks for some marginal Mexican Food? I realize prices have gone up on food and produce.  I am sort of expecting to see some price increases across the board at some of my favorite spots.  But this was what I consider to be way out of line with the quality of food, service and overall dining experience."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, chips and salsa are free, plentiful and pretty good, they serve both a hot and mild salsa. I've had several items on the menu and all are tasty for your standard Mexican American fare. Great margs too! Service is usually very good, rarely have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"The wait staff was quite friendly.  However, they all looked at me like I was an alien when I asked for regular queso.  So, they brought me spinach con queso - I didn't ask for that, I wanted queso.  The salsa was ok, was mostly just sauce, no spice or extra ingredients.  The spinach con queso was probably the best I've had in the Valley - but it stopped there.  I ordered a cheese enchilada (hard to screw up) and a chile rellano.  The enchilada was very bland.  The chile rellano was \"soft\" and had no spice kick to it at all.  It wasn't breaded - was simply covered in sauce.  The beans were dry.  The rice was cooked nice, but didn't taste good at all.  I will not suggest this place to anyone, but if my friends chose to eat there again, I would simply eat before going."}
{"text":"Greasy, tasteless food. Too expensive for the quality. Portions are too big for one person even if the food were decent (which it's not)."}
{"text":"Gotta say, love this place just as much as I did 20 years ago at their Scottsdale location. Thank you consistently great and food! I will be back!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years but no more. The take out side doesn't appear to clean their equipment. We have noticed just upon opening that there is a build up of drink spill on the sofa machine. Build up of chip crumbs on the chip scoop and the trash container should be replaced it's so dirty.  If the take out side is this dirty not sure what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Flautas were unevenly cooked. Warm on the middle and burnt on the ends.  Good margaritas. Won't come here again for food. There are better Mexican places."}
{"text":"Service was great tonight.  First time eating in the bar area - as the main dinning room was full of young families.  It had been some time since my past visits which I usually got tacos or enchiladas.  The time between my visits was simply because for me the food was too bland.  I wanted to give it a try again with a recommendation from the server.  I got the green chili tamale... unfortunately very bland as well.  Not sure how it's possible to remove flavor from a tamale but they do it somehow.  I like the place ok, just not my type of mexican."}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable dinner here on a Friday night. Had to wait a couple of minutes for them to clear a booth, but the restaurant was busy so no bother at all.   This was our first time here and I liked the atmosphere.. not what you usually come to find at Mexican restaurants. They have some pink neon lights and some tile, the vibe is more diner than Mexican place but I was into it.   Our waiter was super nice and pretty timely. He stopped by first to get our drink orders. Shortly after, someone delivered chips and salsa to the table. Then our waiter came back with our drinks and took our order. Everything came out as ordered too.   I like my chips thin and super crispy, so I was a huge fan of their chips. They brought out three different salsa containers and I absolutely loved one of them (I just wish I knew what kind it was lol!!).   We went with the pollo diablo, which came with but rice and beans, and a chicken enchilada. We both commented on how the chicken wasn't as dry as some other restaurants in the area, so they won bonus points with us for that. I've had similar dishes to the pollo diablo elsewhere and I liked their version, again most was because the chicken was just right, not too dry, and not too overwhelming. Rice and beans were standard but I liked them.   I would definitely recommend this place and will return! Reasonably priced as well."}
{"text":"I was in town with my niece and my family members that live there recommended this place. I had no clue what to get so I tried the loco mexican pie. Holy moly. It was so good I couldnt stop talking about it. It was enormous and everyone at the table was able to have some and I was still able to get my fill.  The salsa was just ok but I dont really go to mexican places for their salsa. I'm not much of a fan.  The decor was a little odd for a mexican restaurant but, honestly, I didnt care at all because the food was so delish!!! I also liked that they have big cups for drinks. I'm a huge drinker and my biggest pet peeve is having to wait forever for a waiter to fill up my cup.  I cant wait until I'm back in Phoenix because I'm heading straight here!!!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food option in the immediate Paradise Valley Mall area, but only because there really aren't any others. Carolina's, a great casual choice, is a couple miles west on Cactus. Closer by? Well, Taco Bell at Tatum & Shea? Okay. Chipotle and Qdoba, but they don't really count as Mexican restaurants in my book. Maybe the mall food court?  I do like Julio G's lunch menu. Lots of choices. Generously portioned. Reasonably priced. It also doubles as the senior menu any time of day (photo posted).  I also like the kids menu. Drink included. Numerous choices all $5 or less (photo posted).  Service is, for the most part, friendly and attentive.  The quality and presentation of the food is fine. I'm just not a fan of the restaurant's use of seasonings, or lack thereof, starting with the chips and salsa. A mild salsa and a hot sauce are presented with chips immediately after being seated, but neither salsa is particularly flavorful. The enchilada sauce? It's kid friendly (not a compliment). I find myself blending the salsas and adding them to whatever I've ordered to try to compensate for a general lack of zest. For those not wanting much heat in their Mexican food, Julio G's is a decent choice.  Julio's Too, next door, is a nice convenience. The menu and prices are pretty much the same as the main restaurant, but it's a taco shop style space designed for easy carry out or for having a quick bite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars here and by regulars I mean we come usually twice a week. The service is always amazing (we love Bill and his super sweet wife who bartends.)     We like to sit in the bar so we can see games on the tvs and we have never had to wait.   The food is amazing. Best chips and salsa and guacamole. I always get the shrimp tacos (something about the sauce they give you for the tacos is like crack - so good) and my boyfriend usually gets something different each time and has never been disappointed.   Their margaritas are great (get a pitcher to share) and prices are awesome as well.   We love Julio G's and will keep coming... All the time lol. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Dinner in this neighborhood restaurant feels like a family place. The The Barton, excellent job greeting taking orders. The owner however, I Soum is the other given his interaction with others, receded to make a large margarita my first pouring a small one dumping it into a large glass, and then adding ice as to top it off. Good thing I ordered a small margarita from the real bartender.   All that said, margarita with delicious and the chips and salsa fresh crisp and exceptional-- if you like smokey flavor. .. go for the dark red salsa.   The tortilla soup is one of the more flavorful ones in town. With large chunks of chicken, fresh cut vegetables and a wonderful chicken broth it was clearly made a long time ago - in order to meld the flavors.  the portion size was more like an appetizer, it was a great way to end the day. maybe the bartender and the manager need to learn to work together better as I don't need anymore drama when I go to dinner."}
{"text":"Service with Christopher was great, food was good! Salsa is too sweet and the fried ice cream wasn't freshly fried. Some minor changes would make this a great little place!!"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and it was alright. I went at lunch time and got the chicken fajitas. They were so big! I barely made a dent in the plate. The fajitas tasted good and had all of the toppings with them (rice, guac, salsa, etc) but the chicken had some really gross pieces in it. Some were really sinewy and just unpleasant. Overall, it was alright, but I wouldn't rush back here."}
{"text":"This is my one of my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley. We eat here once every few weeks and it is always such a good experience. The service has been amazing every time & our food has always been hot, the perfect temperature and delicious. Maybe it's because we get the same thing every time but I have never had a bad experience here and I consider myself a critic. I see a lot of reviews complaining about upset stomachs but we eat here regularly and are usually healthy eaters and have never gotten \"sick\" so that is probably due to cheesey Mexican food overload, not the quality of their ingredients ."}
{"text":"Best food in town. Love the Italian margaritas there. Waiters and waitress and the 2 host that seats us are very friendly. Been going there before these owners come along."}
{"text":"Understaffed is never a good thing for a restaurant. Empty dirty tables and a 20 minute wait. So we asked to sit in the bar area while we waited. No service. No bartender to even get a beer while u wait! Still, starving we went to the take out side of the place and we had a generous portion of mediocre typical Mexican food. Bland flavors and no salsas on the salsa bar. Staff that showed up to work today seemed nice."}
{"text":"Great and fast service, excellent food. Everything was fresh and came out right on time. Love the decor. Our favorite mexican food in AZ!"}
