{"text":"This place is overrated. Expensive menu and mediocre food. The servers are very impatient and kinda rude if you ask questions. There are plenty of better middle eastern eateries in the area and I do not recommend this one."}
{"text":"WOW! Where do I begin.. I'm visiting from the states and a friend told me to check it when I arrived Monday.This was my first time trying Shawarma and it was Awesome! InFACT it was SO good that I've had it every night for dinner since my arrival. On my Second visit I met the Owner who SEEMED really cool and told me he appreciates me coming in multiple times. ON my THIRD visit (today, I JUST left) I called ahead to ask if they accept USD the young lady said YES we do. So I go there ordered my food and handed the young lady a 20 dollar USD bill. She, in returned gave me 8 dollars CAD. I asked her what was the currency change, and she \"attempted\" to tell me \"we treat it the same\"..... I asked to speak to the owner as, he just waved to me from the kitchen. He comes out with the NASTIEST attitude, and then reaches in the door and grabs a 2 dollar CAD coin.....after I asked for my money back, and says \" I'll bump it up to 10  dollars.\" (Meanwhile the girl who didn't even know there was a currency difference is laughing, when she's truly the ONLY laughing matter.) Now right and right and WRONG is wrong!!!! and Although the food was REALLY good I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN, and I will be sure to tell my buddy about this as well. ULTIMATELY, it's not even about the money. It's the fact that I felt TAKEN ADVANTAGE of, and once I addressed it I received laughter, and a nasty owner who truly showed he doesn't give a damn about customer service."}
{"text":"Its kind of a mom & pop shop; the owner was nice and friendly. Apparently his brother owns a similar joint and now hes opened one up.   I have been to the place a few times now with fellow coworkers during lunch hour to have some awesome shawarma plates.   The food is Halal. There decent amount of space to sit down and eat. Service is not slow and not too fast either.  I have tried their Mixed Shawarma plate, Chicken Shawarma Plate and Tandoori Kabab with Shawarma plate. They plate came with salad, rice, sauces, potatoes and nice amount of meat! The meat was good, well cooked no cheap stuff; yet being tender...The meat was tasty and well marinated.   All in All its great place if you are feeling for a Shawarma.  For my muslim folks - they serve halal meat here."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue!  I've been hitting this place up since it opened! Hands down the best and most delicious shawarma I've had.  I always order the same thing, shawarma dinner to go with rice salad and chicken.  It's just so so so good!  The owners, staff are very friendly! This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Had both their beef and chicken shawarma (combo #8 & #9), each combo approximately $12. The chicken shawarma had way too much fat on the trim and the beef shawarma was too dry for our taste, the feta cheese topping and full chickpeas also didn't pair too well in the shawarma."}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time today. It was delicious.   Majority of shawarma places wrap your shawarma up and then put it in a press.  This place uses thicker bread,  heat it on the grill first,  open it up and stuff it with all the toppings. Exactly the  way pitalicious in markham (best shawarma ever)  does it.   The chicken is very moist and seasoned perfectly. Toppings are all fresh.  They stuff a ton of chicken inside.    Great prices too.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Shawarma I have ever eaten. Every other shawarma place I visit pales in comparison. The chicken is full of flavour and the toppings are delicious. Plus free feta! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than a hole in the wall that serves good food. Came here specifically because of the reviews and the 5 stars. This is a place you definitely wouldn't notice since it's attached to a gas station. Service was super friendly and fast. Food was excellent. Sorry Q nothing gets 5 stars in my book but mama."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. This place has a nice seating area and fresh fixings. Had the chicken shawarma wrap and it was messy but good size portion.  Make sure you get extra napkins."}
{"text":"I stopped by to avoid traffic and to pick up a shawarma plate (I had the chicken tandoori plate). It was unusual to see a shawarma place next to gas station but surprisingly it was good.   Great food and generous portion sizes!"}
{"text":"Edit: About 1 year has passed now and things have changed a bit.  There are some new counter staff that are less careful with the food and general shop cleanliness.  Was quite a bit better when the gents were looking after the details. Changing my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars.  I've been to Q's several times now, usually on Saturday.  The food quality is excellent. Much better than one might expect from the location on property of a gas station.  My kids love it at Q's as well.  Half if the time we eat in and the other half, we take out.  The plates are prepared individually so you can adjust the sides and condiments as you like.  Several healthy meal options that we enjoy!  My favourite is the kabob dinner with little extra chopped salad.  There is also something very moreish about the potatoes, so much so that we talk about it during the week and look forward to the Saturday visit.  When I'm extra hungry, I like to order the hummus plate as a side, and, because it is so yummy, my kids never have left over rice.  It is a cash and debit only place so be prepared for than and bring a healthy appetite.  Located across from CanLan Ice Sports Etobicoke and Schuey's Bar and Grill on property at the Esso station."}
{"text":"In town for work from USA, had no Canadian dollars and they don't take credit card. Debit cards accepted but mine wouldn't work. Lady told me I could just pay another time. I ended up getting Canadian dollars at gas station next door and paying.  Food was good. I had Chicken Shawarma dinner plate, the portion was big enough for two people.  I recommend this place, the tradional Shawarma in pita looked great also."}
{"text":"Great new Shawarma spot in the area. I had the  chicken shawarma dinner with a salad and potatoes. The shawarma was cooked well and the seasoning on top of the potatoes and chicken was great! It was topped with some taziki and hot sauce... Delicious!  Will be back for more."}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for middle eastern cuisines like the chicken shawarma or the beef shawarma. The chicken shawarma Platter etc. The food here is made by great people and they are very polite. Another spot I would recommend to my fellow friends to go and eat."}
{"text":"On paper, this place has NOTHING going for it - middle of no where in an industrial area, part of the same lot as a gas station and auto body shops, on a highway that attracts 18 ton trailers way more than cars. I mean who visits a place like that?  Well, I did - and I totally LOVED it. This place is very hole in the wall, CASH only, minimal furniture and no decor. They serve up plates veyr quickly and have a process for it - be ready with your order when the guy asks - he goes fast through the toppings - you snooze, you lose!   We had the chicken shawarma plate - absolute best ever! Rice was tasty, chicken was tender, flavorful and moist - loved every bite of it!  We ended up using american money bec I am the hightailing chick who decides every place must use a credit card, and the guy charged us like Canadian money - which means I lost a few dollars, but hey - the food was delicious, so no complains!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype about this place was. Cheap ingredients and chicken was extremely dry and had no taste. Way to many shawarma places these days but only a handful of them are good and made with quality"}
