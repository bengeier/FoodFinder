{"text":"This place is awesome! A friend recommended it years ago and I'm so glad she did. The chicken salad sandwich is heavenly, a must try. Everything is fresh and delicious. This place is family owned and operated. They are super friendly people who remember you and make you feel welcome. Oh and did I mention to try the chicken salad? There's nothing like it anywhere, I love it and I'm sure you will too. Do make sure to bring cash as they dont accept anything else."}
{"text":"The cheese steak with sauce & onions is almost as good as the chicken salad; which rocks!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome hidden gem! I've worked right down the street for 10 years but never knew about this place until my uncle recently told me about it. I had the philly cheese steak with peppers and sauce and it was amazing ... and huge! I could only eat half. Great prices for so much delicious food! This is a great little family owned place that has been there for 34 years!!! (They had a big sign stating they just celebrated 34 years on 4/1/11)  It is a cash only restaurant, so make sure you stop at the ATM first. The chef's daughter offered me a sample of the chicken salad her dad makes there daily. It is amazing! They sell over 100 pounds of this a week! Just a really neat place, friendly people, and amazing food! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best deli in Arizona. I grew up down the street from Casella's so I have known about and eaten here almost as long as they have been in business. Now that I live in Casa Grande, I don't get up here as often as I would like but anytime my family is in the valley we try to work it so we can get by for lunch. Our family loves the Pastrami, chicken salad, turkey, and meatball sandwiches but no matter what you order you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"went for lunch and wanted a simple, mellow place with good sandwiches.  Casellas was perfect for this.  i got the italian hogie and my wife, the meatball sandwich.  perfect for what we wanted... very tasty, not oily, and no waiting.  even got a sample of the famous chicken salad and it is quite good.  it is run by the casella family... really nice people and really, mr casella walks around, cleaning up and chatting with the patrons.  regarding the chicken salad, he cooks over a hundred pounds of chicken each week (i think 166 lbs?), he then preps the chicken and mrs casella makes the sauce for the final product. a bit sweet for my taste but it really is quite good and the chicken is very fresh.  would definitely go back when coming thru town!"}
{"text":"Have lived by this place for quite a while.  Finally decided to try it out.  So glad we did.  Very hospitable and friendly staff.  Let us sample the chicken salad which was amazing!  Decided to go for their Philly Cheesesteak, which was so good.  Definately going back for more!"}
{"text":"What can I say...I stumbled upon Casella's because my tanning salon moved next door and I was hungry. I was greated by the owner, Joe and his daughter Denise. The place was occupied by local regulars who seemed to be treated as family. Joe made my sandwich and introduced himself...then came back to check on me and cleaned my table. He even remembered my name! This is a 5 star family owned old fashioned deli. Love it, try the Italian hoagie."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best East Coast style sandwiches in town. The Italian beef is unbelievable and I've had a lot of good pastrami but here it melts in your mouth. This family owned and run business has been in the same spot for 35 years. Joe, the owner is a vet and a true American Hero. If he has time, he likes to sit and tell stories to his customers... Ask him about where he got the recipe for his Italian Beef."}
{"text":"The Sauce was AMAZING very nice people family made restraunt Choc Chip cookies are great everything homedade I would give it a 10 if I could!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've used Yelp for a few years, but I just experienced a meal that I had to write about.  Very few times have I ran across a family as passionate as Joe and Tina Cassella and their lovely daughters.  

They take providing food to a customer as a special privilege that they own.  They are responsible for what they put in their customers' bodies.  

Now onto the food...if you can only stop for one thing, you have to buy the potato and chicken salad.  Both of these sides are homemade and delicious!  

The steak sandwiches would make Philadelphia proud, I recommend the works sandwich myself.  

God Bless Joe, Tina and family!!

{"text":"Fantastic place for a good meal! We walked in and we're immediately greeted by the owner and his wife, the whole  place feeling like a relaxed family gathering. After talking with us for a few minutes, we placed our orders and the food was out in under 10 minutes. The roast beef was delicious along with a great pasta salad. At the end of the meal Denise's Homemade Chocolate Chip Cookies wrapped things up well. All in all it was an enjoyable dining experience made excellent by friendly people and a warm environment. I'd come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I attended the local high school, graduated in '82. This was my favorite lunch stop by far. The roast beef, the chicken salad, and the cheese steak with sauce and onions were my favorites, but it's all good. 

Since then, I've lived in Tucson, Flagstaff, Seattle and Honolulu and I've yet to find a sandwich place anywhere close to as good as Cassellas. I had chicken salad sandwiches flown out to Seattle 10 years ago, and visited the deli myself 5 years ago, and nothing had changed, it was as good as I remembered and just as inexpensive. 

Those of you local to the area, enjoy it, cuz you ain't gonna find a replacement very easily anywhere else."}
{"text":"Italian Deli???  With all of the 4 and 5 Star reviews I was expecting a real Italian Deli. Not even close. Where is the Capocolla, Mortadella, I could go on and on but it is non-existent.  The menu is limited to a short list of hot sandwiches and a short list of cold sandwiches. Nothing is custom made. From all the reviews I tried a half chicken salad and a half hoagie.  The chicken salad was chicken, celery, and mayo. They bobbed it on a decent french roll. No lettuce, no tomato, no pickles or peppers of any kind.  The \"Italian Hoagie\" was also on a decent french roll and contained 3 slices of salami, a slice of boiled colorless ham, a slice of cheese you could see through, a little shredded lettuce, 2 thin half slices of tomato, and a small amount of dressing that was hard to find. Nothing else.  The prices are inexpensive, but it's no wonder. Italian Deli?  I don't  think so.  Makes me think all the reviews are phony."}
{"text":"I have been living in Arizona for 4 years and have yet to find a decent Italian Beef Sandwich, until now.  I even gave the same statement to the owner.  I had ordered an Italian Beef for carry out, and while I was waiting, I let him know my frustrations.  He gave me his card and told me to call him after I ate the sandwich because he wanted to know what I thought.  Well, it was FANTASTIC!  Of course, I called him back to let him know.  

The service, and the time and effort put into the food cannot be beat.  This is what you get for a mom and pops type place.  

There are plenty of other sandwiches and foods there too.  I can't wait to go back and try some more!"}
{"text":"Just went in and had the Italian hoagie and it was amazing! My boyfriend had the cheesesteak and it was to die for. Just when I thought j couldn't eat Anymore they gave us a very generous taste of the chicken salad and it was some of the best I've ever tasted. We will be back and I highly recommend it. Who doesn't love a place that you are treated like family the moment you walk in the door."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!   Chicken Salad is amazing!   Everything I've ever ordered, have not been disappointed.  From the bread, to service.  I have driven 40 mins just to grab a sandwich. Best place hands down.  

One of the reviews on here said \"unless you grew up eating slop you won't like it\".   And some other inaccurate stuff. This person obviously doesn't know an Italian deli and should be banned for not understanding or appreciating real food.  After reviewing her other \"reviews\" clearly she doesn't like a lot of places.  She sounds like a person that should just stay home and eat her own food. Just sayin."}
{"text":"If you want to great sandwich you absolutely have to go here family-run excellent service food is top notch super old-school love it!   They haven't changed a thing since the 70s and that's part of the charm.  This is my go to place for sandwich for the past 30 years"}
{"text":"What a great little family owned joint!  Everyone is so friendly here, and this is one of those ran places that the family runs the place, and knows the majority of the patrons by name.  I love right here in the neighborhood, and can't believe it's taken me this long o discover this gem.  If you're ever in the old town area, it's worth the trek over here to casella's to grab a sandwich.  I recommend the hot Italian beef which was outstanding!

I will no longer be going to Subway and encourage you to do the same.  Let's keep the dollars local, and hit up Casella's where the sandwiches are easily twice as good!"}
{"text":"Family-owned for 35 years and we felt like family on our first visit! We stopped by here yesterday after reading reviews from other yelpers and we were not disappointed. The pizza hoagie was delish- even my kids ate every last drop. Husband had the pepper cheesesteak and devoured it. Make sure you have cash and drop by here soon!"}
{"text":"I nearly missed my flight for these sandwiches and it was totally worth the stress! I was in from CA to catch a couple Giants games and had an hour to spare before getting to the airport. I had seen this place on Yelp and thought I'd get a sandwich for the flight back.

Denise and Joe were the nicest, most genuine folks. They exuded warmth and pride of ownership and it certainly shows in their food. The roast beef was awesome, and Joe offered me some straight from the slicer while I was waiting. Denise offered me a taste of the homemade chicken salad which was delicious indeed. I would have loved to try the hot sandwiches, especially the meatball, but that will have to wait until next time as I needed cold options for the flight. 

I couldn't resist the buy 2 get 1 free so I made it 2 roast beefs and an italian. I ate 1 before I reached airport and the other roast beef that night! The italian was my lunch the next day--very tasty, too. 

The food was excellent but the customer service confirmed a legitimate 5 star rating. I will return whenever I visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Lots of regulars here, and it's understandable. The woman at the counter was greeting everyone by name, shaking hands with them, and seemed to know personal details about many of them. A feeling of genuine kindness and wanting to be of service prevails here. I'm guessing if it wasn't for the counter in the way I would have seen hugs exchanged. The look of the place is dated and nothing special, but the customer service makes the atmosphere a standout. 

     Prices are reasonable (cash only), even by fast-food standards. Under $7 for a sandwich, the most expensive item on the menu is the $10 lasagna dinner (I'm betting it's a bargain). They don't do fancy. It's simple food done well. Quality, fresh ingredients. I had the pastrami sandwich and a cannoli for dessert. Great stuff!

     A family run shop that makes you feel like you are in your grandma's kitchen while you are there. Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time, and I believe they have a returning customer.  At first glance, you would likely overlook this hidden gem.  It is tucked away in the back of strip mall.  The interior looks like it is from the 70's with hardwood paneling.  However, don't let this fool you.  It has been owned and operated by the same family for over 30 years.  It is very cheap and is a great deli.  The chicken salad club is awesome.  Definitely try this if it is your first time.  The Italian sub was also good.  The bread is what makes these sandwiches so great.  The Philly sub also looked great, and I will return for that.  

The service was spectacular and they treat you like you are an old friend.  Every member of the family chips in, and they go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your meal.  This is so rare in today's society.

If you buy 2 during the week you get 1 free as well...awesome deal!"}
{"text":"Once upon a long, long time ago life seemed simpler. Neighborhoods were more stable, everybody knew everybody. When you went into a store, the shopkeeper called you by name and probably knew what you were planning to buy. For better or worse (and it certainly wasn't all good) those times are long gone - but we found a little slice of it last Friday.

     When we walked into Casella's Italian Sub Shop at about 3PM, we were warmly greeted by Joe and Denise, a father/daughter team. Joe, originally from Philadelphia, opened the restaurant thirty-three years ago in this exact spot in a strip mall on Granite Reef, just south of McDonald in Scottsdale. Denise started working with him twenty some years ago. They instantly know if you're part of the \"family\" or a newbie. If you're curious about an item on the menu, you're given a taste. Most of the things are made in house. Joe cooks 70 pounds of chicken breast a week for his famous chicken salad. Mom makes the meatballs, and Denise the cannoli filling. I could go on, but you get the idea. These are genuinely nice people who care about their product and want to please the customer. Joe gets in every morning at 7:30 (although service doesn't start until  11 AM) and stays right through closing at 6 PM. He likes to know what's going on. Saturday closing is at 3 PM so everybody can spend time with their families. And there's a lengthy Christmas break for the same reason. Very nice.

     Naturally, Philadelphia Steak Sandwiches ($6.60 - $7.20) appear on the menu. Joe's isn't your typical greasy, cheese whiz loaded, meat too-tough-to-chew sandwich (which, I admit, often appeals to me): here the meat is meltingly tender, sauced with a little marinara, and topped with provolone, served on an outstanding roll made by a local family baker.

     We had to try the chicken salad sandwich ($3.70 fir a half, $7.20 full size) - we knew it would be fresh since Joe cooks up a batch most mornings. In the back cooler you can see huge jars of mayonnaise waiting their turn. The salad was very simple, not gussied up with lots of add-ins. I will say that when I ate the leftovers at home I added a dollop of cranberry sauce. I think I'll bring some to Casella's next time we go.

     After 2 PM, if you buy two sandwiches, you get a third free. So I chose the Italian Hoagie ($3.70/$6.80). Ken was astonished to find that he actually enjoyed this one. What made it truly delicious, oddly enough, were the onions. Thinly sliced, and sweet enough to be eaten on their own, they also graced the cheese steak. Our side of homemade coleslaw was one of the best versions in town. Can't wait to try the potato and pasta salads. 

     Other sandwices on the menu include roast beef, ham and cheese, meatball, sausage, and pastrami (not made in-house). Also available are two entrees: Lasagna ($10) and Spaghetti & Meatballs ($8). 

     Now for dessert. Ken wanted a cannoli, usually not something I like. I'm now a convert, at least to Casella's version. Denise makes the silky filling, garnished only with a few chocolate chips, and the large, wonderfully crispy shells don't get filled until you're ready to snarf one down. Homemade rice pudding is on the menu. We had a taste and it, too, was delicious, but it had no raisins. We'll bring those next time, along with the cranberry sauce.

     Not much to say about the decor. I think it came from that long, long ago time. Basic wood paneling. There are photographs of years and years of Saguaro High (I think that's the school) graduating classes. That's about it. But the warmth of the Casella's fills the room."}
{"text":"Amazing steak sandwich!  These are the type of restaurants I love.  They go the extra mile on prep and ingredients and deliver a supreme product and great prices.  The family character comes through on their offerings.  Mom's lasagna and dad's thinly sliced steak.  Put this on your list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the simple decor and wood paneling, this deli can pump out some of the best food you have ever had, promise. Most of the food is homemade by the Casella family, like the roast beef, meatballs, lasagna, chicken salad, well you get the idea.  Along with great food it is a family owned customer service experience.  They know the regulars by name, everyone is greeted when they walk in and they strive to make you happy.

With its location close to the 101 it is an excellent location for lunch or to swing by and pick up some dinner, until 6pm.

A couple of recommendations:
1 - Have the steak works with sauce.
2 - Try the chicken salad.
3 - Bring cash, they don't take anything else.
4 - Have a canoli, best ever.

Just to drive my point home, they have been in business in the same location for 35 years, run by the same family.

Go, enjoy and support this exemplary local business."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. If you're in the mood for a good sandwich, this is the place to go.

We went here the other day after my nephew's little league game and I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on. Not only is everyone really friendly here, but the food is fantastic.

I ordered the Italian sub, which wad delish and my hubby ordered the cheesesteak, which I also loved. We will be coming back here often and probably become regulars."}
{"text":"Nice, quick service! Family oriented and have a very simple but delicious menu. The pizza hoagie was my favorite off the menu. I recommend this place for a quick sandwich you can count on that delivers on taste."}
{"text":"The Italian hoagie is the best I have ever had (and I have been looking for LONG time!)  ...Be sure and get the onions!

My first visit came as a result of looking for the \"most highly rated\" Italian place in Scottsdale (after a poor experience at a different unnamed Italian restaurant that left a bad taste in my mouth.)  I got the buy 2 get 1 free sandwich special and tried the Italian, the meatball, and the chicken salad.

It smelled so good (and I was so excited about it) that I didn't even wait until I got home to start eating...  I pulled over into the shade and dug into my meatball sub!  The bread was soft, the sauce was tangy, and the meatballs delicious and plentiful.  It was perfection.

I enjoyed all the sandwiches so much, that I went and bought 5 more the same week!!  (...And ate them all myself!)

But be advised, it is CASH only (which is probably a good thing, since it keeps one from over-eating??!)"}
{"text":"This place is great. If you don't get the chicken salad sandwich, make sure to get it as a side. It's amazing. The staff is also very nice. The next time I'm in the area, I know where I'm going for fantastic food at a great price. In case you missed it, make sure to eat the chicken salad. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"I drive over 20 miles one-way just for the roast beef!  You can't get quality roast beef from any store today, not even the high end grocery stores.  But you can always get it at Casella's, and at a very reasonable price.  Sure, stop by for lunch and get your hogie and meatball sandwiches, every sandwich is made with love and they are all great.  But before you leave, ask for some sliced roast beef and some provolone to go.  You will never buy roast beef from ANY grocery store again!  BTW, get some cannolis too.  They are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Delicious pastrami sandwich. Mmmmmm. Supposedly the chicken salad sub the the best ever. Nice old deli atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great friendly mom and pop deli. These people know how to treat their customers. A place locals love as just about everyone there was called by name.  We had turkey, ham And cheese and itailian subs all fresh as can be and great. While we were waiting they gave us a sample of their chicken salad too. Yummy . Not freaky fast by any means but each sandwich made to order and wrapped and marked with perfection."}
{"text":"My date insisted I post his review.  Again, HE wrote this- NOT ME...

I had high hopes for this place's cannolis, but I was quite disappointed. I entered the establishment and was greeted by a very bubbly women, who really talked up the cannolis and offered me a spoonful of the cannoli filling. I obliged, and tasted the filling and it was satisfactory. I didn't want to be rude so I still ordered a few cannolis giving the establishment the benefit of the doubt that they would be better in their wrapping. Boy was I wrong... The wrapping was poor at best. It was much too hard and pretty much ruined my day. The bubbly women told me that if I wanted to order some for the holidays I would have to order them far in advance as there are so many people ordering them during the holiday season. Pfffff no need to worry about that, as I will not be back. I don't know if the people who are ordering these cannolis in mass are stupid or just have never had a proper cannoli. I guess I'll just choose to believe the latter. PS I am writing this as I sit on my toilet with explosive diarrhea, that I suspect was caused from the cannoli."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, the people are amazing, and everything was home made!!! I highly recommend the chicken salad sandwich! Its a family recipe the pasta salad was unbelievable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I got my cash ready and went to check this place out. I ordered the meatball sandwich and potato salad. The meatball sandwich is very good and filling. So glad I tried that! The potato salad was good too. Joe, the owner, was very friendly and helpful. I am definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to! Their chicken salad sandwiches, Italian beef, ham and cheese, and turkey sandwiches are amazing! No one in the valley can top  this restaurant. My favorite side is the Health Salad which is carrots, cucumbers and celery marinated in tangy sweet dressing that I dip my sandwiches in.

Above this fabulous place, I hold most dearly the kind people that work here. It's a family run business that has been around since the seventies. Every single one of them will say hi when a customer walks in and knows their loyal patrons by name and even, remarkably, remembers what they love to eat. This is a true gem. I recommend everyone to enjoy the deliciousness that is Casella's."}
{"text":"This place rocks and has a great feel of hospitality. The pastrami sandwich is the best I've ever had. Check it out and support a local business!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places you wish Yelp would allow more than five stars. The service was probably the best I've ever had. Even the Four Seasons can't top the Casella family. When I was debating over a few different items they gave me samples of each to try without me even asking. The owner came and sat with us a bit to make sure our sammies were to our liking and to tell us the history of his family business. I had the cheesesteak, my fellow diner had the meatball sub and both were solid. Also, ordered some chicken salad to go. They apparently sell 150 pounds a month of the stuff and after one bite you'll know why. It's classic and good! Yes the place looks like it hasn't been updated since it opened in 1977 but it all adds to the character. My only wish is that they would have a few tables outside."}
{"text":"Excellent food and FANTASTIC service! We were visiting from out of town, 11 of us including 5 kids. They quickly put tables together and made us feel at home. The food arrived quickly, and everyone enjoyed it. We'd come here regularly if we lived here. Highly recommend it. Thank you, Casella's!!"}
{"text":"The service here was fantastic and personable and you can tell they care about the food they serve.

I ordered a steak sandwich and it was hot and good.

The only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars was because they don't take credit cards and I didn't see a bathroom anywhere. But if you want fantastic food at a simple, relaxing deli...can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Classic deli with good food at a fair price. The decor is stuck in the 70's but The service is first rate and very friendly. Not a fan of the cash only policy since I use my debit card for everything.  Fountain drinks would be nice upgrade."}
{"text":"What great food! Try the chicken salad that is homemade potato salad. Best of all, the family that runs the place were so nice to us out of towners."}
{"text":"Saw this place on \"check please, AZ\"  Service was outstanding as was the food, which included their roast been sub and potato salad.  The owner sat down with us and was most friendly and informative about the deli's past.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This please is totally legit, I'm from Philly and Joe Cassella knows his food. Super friendly and great food, don't miss this place."}
{"text":"It has been twenty plus years since I have had one of Casella's famous sub sandwiches. It was just as good as I remember.  The coleslaw is out of this world. I guarantee it will not be another twenty years. Next Friday I will be visiting them again.  Sorry I have stayed away so long.  Please remember this is cash only business.  Don't worry, it is very light on the wallet.  :)"}
{"text":"Great food and super nice and friendly family (especially Lisa) who own and operate this cute, cash-only italian deli.  Loved it!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Found this place because of yelp reviews.  Homemade, family run, community supported spot.  Great service, cash only.  Now one of my go-to sandwich spots when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ehhhh well this place is okay. I work in the area and thought I would give it a try. The food is nothing special, I will not be back. For one they only take cash, two nobody was wearing gloves well making your food, three the only use a microwave! 
I watched the lady cash out someone before me touch the money and the register and than go make someone else's sandwich. I'd pass on that."}
{"text":"Best cheese steak west of Philadelphia! Great salads, pasta and owners. The buns are fantastic."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and the atmosphere are great. Joe, the owner, made us feel like we were long time customers even though it was our first time in the shop. They have a limited menu on Sunday's (no steak sandwiches) but most of the menu is still available. 

We decided for the meatball sub and the pizza hoagie, both of which were delicious. 

The atmosphere is definitely retro (70s) but in a good way. Cash only. You don't see many places like this in Scottsdale anymore. They really care about the customer and want to make you the best sandwich you have ever eaten. 

I will definitely be back in."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches and great family feel!! 
Joe came up to personally thank us for coming in as well as share his goals with us; a very wise man! 
From the food to the entire Casella family, what a find!"}
{"text":"Relied on the reviews to stop in and it is exactly as described.  Philly cheesesteaks are great and the friendly service is tops.  Even though it was the lunch rush Joe took time to tell us about the menu and showed off the offerings in his place.  Definitely going back to try the subs and sides."}
{"text":"Great place.  Perfect service. Can't wait to go back.  Pasta salad was delish."}
{"text":"If you love mom & pop  shop,, try this place!
We stopped by on Sunday and had delicious fresh made deli sandwiches!!!  The owner, Joe, was working solo but managed to visit our table to chat!  They just celebrated 40years of serving homestyle Italian cooking!  it's no wonder they are the neighborhood's favorite place to hang out or take out! Please do not change a thing!"}
{"text":"Over 40 years in business is all you need to know. They treat you like family and serve some of the best, reasonably priced meals in Arizona. Finally a restaurant that truly deserves all the 5 star ratings. The Philly steaks are amazing. The chicken salad delicious. The subs are fantastic. The chocolate chip cookies are to die for. Joe and his family are dedicated to make you feel satisfied and leave with a smile on your face. So glad we stopped by. Sorry we live so far away. Hope Joe continues to thrive for another 40 years!"}
{"text":"Family owned, super friendly and delicious homemade food! Love their fluffy chicken salad!"}
{"text":"i was craving a sandwich after my meeting, so i yelped for sandwich shops nearby. casella's caught my eye with the high reviews. walking in, i was a little apprehensive...but i reminded myself this is a mom and pop shop. they are all about the food. 

one of the ladies that works there told me about the menu, and was very excited i was a first timer. i got a couple of Italian beef sandwiches to-go. get the au jous with it (she recommended i did). so delicious. my boyfriend about died and went to heaven when he took his first bite. 

we will definitely be back. this place lives up to their reviews!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good the stories from the owner better it's a little overpriced but you can't beat the amount of laughs you have there."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to stop for lunch.   They close at 6, so you can get an early dinner if you need.   Walked in for the 2nd time and they knew my name and my wife's.   All food is made on premise!

Going \"cheese steak\" today!  Meat is fresh eye of round, sliced that day!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for years! it is family owned by the Casella's family. They make the best sandwiches in the valley in my opinion. The turkey sub is awesome as well as the Italian beef which is to die for. The only pitfall to this place is that they do not accept debit cards, cash only."}
{"text":"Casellas=The Best.  I recommend the chicken salad and roast beef subs.  I can ONLY recommend those two subs because in all the years I've gone there, I haven't been able to get past those 2...because they're sooooo good.  From reading the other reviews, I know everything else is good.  This place is terrific. The staff treats you like family.  Thank you Casellas!!"}
{"text":"Real food. Real people. AND the only place in town for a real Italian Hoagie! My dad (Philly native) found Joe and family, days after moving to AZ. I went to HS down the street. If we could eat their food daily, we would. My son is a hoagie lover and my daughter fell in love with their spaghetti. It's a family affair for everyone they've touched and fed! I don't dare tell someone I've had a hoagie for lunch unless I brought more for dinner! It's also way cool that they actually close every year to take a real family vacation. So cool, that their loyal customers wait patiently for their return!"}
{"text":"Casella's is a wonderful neighborhood deli, run by a family that's been in business in the same spot for 38 years! It's where the locals go, and it seems they go often and know everybody else there. Good vibes come from every direction at Casella's! 

When you go, here's a special tip: Order the pizza hoagie with added meatballs, which were cut up into small pieces throughout the sandwich. I have had a lot of hoagies in a lot of places, but I've had none better than this one. In fact, I'd venture to say it's the very best. 

My wife had the Italian hoagie, which I tasted and also found delicious. We spoke with Mr. Casella, who with his wife founded the place. 

For dessert we had a package of Denise's chocolate chip cookies. Get some! 

We live about a 10-minute drive from Casella's, and we plan to return there many times in the future for genuinely authentic happy meals.  :-)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy their chicken salad and have been for over 20 years. This is a bare-bones mom-and-pop type of place that survives on it's consistent quality of recipes and service.  Your chicken salad, health salad and cheesesteaks are the best items on their menu IMHO."}
{"text":"This deli is such an amazing place, my mother used to come here when she was younger so she brought me for the first time back in 2010. Since then it has been my favorite place to eat, I finally was in the area again and brought my wife and daughter and they both loved it! It's awesome how friendly the people are, and that nobody makes them self out to be a stranger. I also found it amazing how the father who owns the place is so proud of his wife, his family, and his deli. It's a shame they aren't as widely known and recognized through AZ as they should be. I love the place and the people. I couldn't have had a better experience every visit, I've never left here diss appointed!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 4 star review because the service was so fantastic, however I found the food to be pretty average."}
{"text":"Excellent chix salad sandwich and philly cheese steak. Finish off with some of their incredible cannolis or cookies. Great service at this quaint family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Ahhh, Casellas....  nothing has changed in 30 years about you except now some of your grand daughters are starting to learn the ropes and take over.  How do I know?  I have been going here for at least 30 years.

They have maintained this place meticulously over the coarse of years.  It has been in this same strip mall location for over 30 and some of its old neighbors that have come and gone include a skate shop \"Cheap Skate\" and a record store \"The Singing Dog\", both of which I would loiter on a regular basis back in the day.  

First thing you will notice when you walk in is the awesome wood paneling.  Way old school, no frills decor.   They same meat cases, refrigerator....  you get the idea.  In fact, the little pin-up menu hasn't even changed either.  Still the little black style with the press in letters.

The menu is simple.  Sandwiches, chips and a drink.  They make the best meatballs for ala carte munching or sandy style.  This is my favorite...  but close on it's heels are the Hoagie and the Pepper steak works.  Buy one of those giant pickles in the back case.  

I ran into a friend there, as I usually do.  He had a very tasty looking pastrami on rye.

Oh, be sure to check out all the Saguaro High School class photos since...  I dunno, maybe 1985?  Every year since!  I am in the 1990 one!"}
{"text":"First time try this deli, the price is a bit high, but I try it by good reviews.  I have Italian hoagie, chicken salad, and pepper & cheese steak...not very surprising (I over expect the tastes and Italian flavors).  The Italian hoagie I like the best, it has a lot of olive oil, but the half sandwich is pretty small, about 5\".  The chicken salad is ok, not much different from other deli (I expect to taste something totally different from Italian deli). The pepper & cheese steak is fresh made when u order, the taste is alright, I need to add salt and black pepper to the sandwich to bring up all the flavors..not bad.  Overall, the taste of the sandwich is alright, but it is fresh made, the staffs are super friendly, and I like to support local family owned restaurant, so I would give 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great. We had four orders: meatball sub, cheese steak, Pastrami, and pizza hoagie. Everything was awesome. The meatballs kept shape but were soft and tender. The owner Joe brought us all a taste of the chicken salad. We all decided that we would return the next day to get chicken salad to go. Much to our disappointment they are closed on Sunday. If you are ever close stop and eat. They are friendly and the food is awesome."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE places to go since I was a kid and even now! I love the family and love their sandwiches. Their Italian sub and philly cheesesteak are my favs! It is always good!!!"}
{"text":"Roast beef is a fairly bomb food to eat. It goes well on sandwiches. I enjoy sandwiches including the one I had here! Booyaka!"}
{"text":"This place is a super old school and family run. The sandwiches are all made fresh. The cheese steak with the homemade sauce is the best I have had in Scottsdale. Its a pain that they are cash only but I'll save my dollars specifically to come here. In the words of the Terminator.. \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"So before someone takes away my Phoenician card, I have never been here before.  A girlfriend has been going here for years, was dumbfounded that I had never been, so we bee lined it here. First of all, the owners are from my neck of the woods in PA so insta-love fest. Secondly, warm and welcoming they were so nice to go through the menu and give me samples of the food to help make my decision (which didn't cause everything is so damn good).  I decided on the chicken salad sandwich, TO DIE!!! I MEAN SERIOUSLY!!! It was so damn good.  

I love everything about the place. Next time, cheesesteak sandwiches; he's from Philly and they use real meat not the pre packaged stuff. I'm so stoked. Go here, spend the cash (cash only) support local businesses and fall in love. I did."}
{"text":"I have been trying to go to this place for months now, but it is a bit difficult with the limited hours.  I showed up with a friend of mine for lunch on a Monday (I had the day off work) and we were informed right away it is a CASH-ONLY joint....so we took a trip down the strip mall to the grocery store to retrieve cash and came back.  We both opted for the Italian Sub with two large drinks, which came to around $17.  I would say the sandwiches were about 10inches long and they came with no accompanying side dishes.  The meats on the sub were good with the perfect amount of dressing so the bread didn't get all mushy.  And the drinks came with free refills.  You can tell the place has been around for a very long time and the people who work there are very nice.  I thought the food was decent, but I lived in Europe and and an Italian neighborhood in NYC, so my expectations are very high when it comes to Italian delis."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Probably the best meatball sandwich I've ever had! But sadly I can never really return because I never carry cash on me. It's the 20th century and the cheapest and easiest it's ever been to take credit cards. Do it."}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few years now; I wish I found out about this the day I was born. 

Service:
I don't think it gets much more personal than this. They care about you -- the customer. The whole Casella family is amazing (they run the joint).

Food:
Their food is insane.

What I recommend:

Chicken Salad - I get this on the wheat roll with tomato and lettuce

Italian - leave it the way it comes on a white roll. It has some provolone, two meats, tomatoes, lettuce, oil/vinegar dressing, and some oregano -- trust me - leave it alone!

Steak w/ the works - so when I first heard of this \"steak with the works\" -- I was like \"Are you serious? Why the hell would I want to put your delicious home made marinara sauce on a cheese steak? That's poppycock!\" 
(rant/tangent)
Listen to them. They know what they're talking about. You want a freaking cheese steak in Arizona? Well get it from someone that lived in Philly and decided to grace us with his presence back 33 years ago and say \"HEY -- This! Is a cheese steak.\" (angels ahhh ahhh ahhhhh ahhhh). Which reminds me - they've been in the same neighborhood spot for over 33 years. Family owned.

Anyways, so cheese steak, I would get extra cheese, because well, I love cheese. You can order this to go and eat it at home, but I would rather eat it in the car, then let this baby depreciate. It is so damn good. GET IT

So they also have sides, pasta salad, bomb, fresh made lemon aid and iced tea (Arnold Palmer people!)

Cannolis - o wow - freshly piped - insane - delicious things

Pizzelles -- made fresh by a lovely lady that you'll usually find behind the counter! Chocolate, Regular flavor, I believe lemon. Bomb -- wow oh wow!

Bread: white or wheat roll - baked fresh by a local bakery

I have coined the term: \"So good, it's worth the drive\"

I haven't been here in about two months, I've been quite busy, but am going to make it this Saturday for the people I manage. Free lunch for the bunch! (I'm paying)

There is only one Casellas -- you must go here. You must try it. If you don't like it -- email me and I will refund you. I will also call you a moron in the process.

Oh and prices, jesus is it cheap!

{"text":"Live very close and have driven past this place more times than I can mention. Always said we should try it out someday...well today was that day and now I'm mad we waited so long.  We had an awesome Philly cheese steak and sampled their chicken salad (which was amazing). I can't wait to go back and try more of their food. Extremely friendly and even suggested other great restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This deli truly is as good as it gets. If you are interested in finding an authentic deli, run by family members who love what they do, and who have been doing it since 1977, than this is your place!!! Along with class photos from nearby Saguaro High School, their walls are full of awards they earned throughout the years that claim Casells's as the best deli around. And I agree! The food all looked amazing and I look forward to coming back to try more things on the menu, especially the meatballs! For this visit, I had the turkey sub as well as the Italian Hoagie. I had a side of the baked beans as well. Everything was tasty! We couldn't help ourselves, and on the way out we just had to get a couple of the fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies made from grandma's original recipe. For a real treat, ask to see if Joe is around. If he isn't too busy in the back making chicken salad (he makes 40 lbs of it every other day) or fresh sausage, he will gladly come out and chat with you. 

This deli is worth the drive from anywhere in the Valley. It is definitely worth a visit. One trip and you will want to come back again and again. I know I do, and I know a lot of people have. Plenty of regulars came in while we were there. I know this because each one was greeted with their first name as they came in and were all asked how their family was doing. Become the newest member of the Casella family and stop on by!

PS: Cash only, no credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"Drove over for lunch based on other reviews here.   Glad I did.   Very simple menu,  about 10 cold sandwiches and 10 hot sandwiches on their menu board. 
I told them it was my first visit so they gave me a tour of their meat case and salads.  I really wanted the pasta salad as a side but said the slaw looked good.  They offered me a taste.  Their small side is $1.00 so I had both. 
My cold Italian sub had fresh filings on a nice fresh roll.  Of course I included the onions and hot peppers.
I love supporting independent businesses and this is one I'll continue to support. 
Be aware,  cash only!"}
{"text":"If you came here for a  cheesesteak.. you are not the sharpest tool in the shed. Go to PSC or DeFalcos for that.

Steak works, all day. Every day, 14 times on sunday. In my mouth, right now.

The people who work here remember you after a few visits, genuinely care about their regulars and make this place feel like visiting family. It reminds me of every small town east coast eatery I grew up going to in the 80s and early 90s.

I hope it never changes."}
{"text":"Chicken salad sandwich is very good. If you come here starving you're going to have to probably buy two of whatever you get, because 1 - it's delicious, and 2- its a modest size. The menu at DeFalco's for example is much broader, and they have larger portions. I had the Italian sandwich and it was good as well.

As several have noted, this place looks like someone kept the dust covers on everything for 30 years and then decided to reopen it again. There is a lot more potential for this place, but they seem to be sticking to what has worked for the past 30+ years. While nostalgic it also seems a little lazy. 

Bottom line is eat here."}
{"text":"Amazing family owned sandwich shop.  I can't believe that after almost 30 years of living in the Valley, I only discovered it this year.

The food is delicious.  Great hoagies, good salads, and great hot sandwiches... the cheesesteak is not to be missed in my opinion, but there hasn't been a single sandwich I haven't liked.

What really sells it though is the family.  They are amazing- friendly, will get to know you by name (right off the bat on your first visit), and will make you feel at home.  They are pretty incredible and they make this place extremely special.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE Casella's Deli!!!!

If I could give this place ten stars I would in a heart beat.

I truly can't decide what I adore more, the amazing sandwiches, or the warm, friendly family that runs the joint?

Today I took two co-workers to lunch, and when we arrived, we were greeted  so warmly and sincerely, it was like we were family. This is not to be confused with forced corporate niceness that you see at Safeway- this is the real deal.

It gets better. One of my friends didn't think he was hungry, so I ordered a sub, and my other buddy ordered a cheese steak. The employee took or order and invited us to grab a seat.

A short while later, the sweet woman said, \"Hey boys- come and get it.\" When my other friend saw how good the food was, I ordered him a sandwich, and when I went to pay, the woman told me that since it was almost 2:00pm, the sandwich would be free, as they have a buy two, get one after two. I think it was like 1:45, and I thought that was SO cool. Where else does that happen? Let me help you with the answer- nowhere!  You and I both know there are places that won't give you a deal if you are ONE MINUTE early, let alone really early.

On to the food, the sub I got, the Italian cold cut combo, was amazing. Fresh EVERYTHING, great bread, etc. It was simple, delicious and clearly made with pride.

In closing, this place is just a gem, seriously. They are getting ready to celebrate 34 years, and my only regret is just now finding them.

Give Casella's a shot, you will not be disappointed. If you like great food, warm people, and interdependent businesses- this is your place!

Two quick tips:

1. Like many small businesses, they take cash only

2. They are located on the SE corner of Granite Reef and McDonald. Enter from Granite Reef, they are on the South end of the complex."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while searching for places that have good cannoli. Was heading to a family dinner and was needing these but they had to be great because we are all from back east, where baked goods are amazin!  This is a real family place, owner and his wife and children all work here, its a small deli and it is a CASH ONLY place!  They are very kind people and really appreciate your business. The cannoli looked great but it wasnt until later that evening that we realized these are TOP NOTCH! The shell was crispy and even after having the filling inside they were crispy, no sogginess to be found! They were fully filled and super delicious.  They also make steak sandwiches and a yummy chicken salad we were given a sample of.  Thanks again Joe!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Deli, Bring cash, great food"}
{"text":"Decided that no Philly steak should be cross-pollinated with red sauce, it just doesn't work well. The bread is soft and the meat is fresh, but this sandwich just is very average and just not that tasty enough for another visit in two years. First off, the setup is wrong - you should be walking past all the food in the tray's before you ever get to the register, otherwise how the hell do you know what they are serving? I suspect since the place is 40 years old, the setup doesn't matter due to all the regular's who support mom and pop stuff. Hey, if a chain is better, then that's where I'm going, no loyalty for me. Prices are also up a dollar as my last menu this sandwich was $7.20 and now we are at $8.20 and you still can't use your debit card. Cash Only only benefits the employer and too me indicates cheap owners who don't care about customers."}
{"text":"This place is great! First of all I called on a Sunday to see if they were open. Well, they are closed on Sunday but that didn't stop the owner from picking up the phone and talking to me. He was really cool. Says he works about 5 hours on Sunday just prepping for the next week!
Anyway, we went during the week. I got an italian beef w/provolone and the wife got the chicken salad. Very tasty, homemade food. A very friendly, family owned business. What's not to love?!
I really appreciate these types of businesses in the community so I will be back frequently to support them. 
Please give them a try. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I heard the place was very good--stopped in and had the Cheese Steak. Ordered with grilled onions, but didn't get them. Sandwich was pretty good, but nothing really special. Did not really meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Casella's has the best cheese steaks in Arizona!!! They have really good lemonade, ice tea, pasta and potato salad too. Everything is homemade and deeeeeeeeeeeeeeelicious. It makes my tummy happy :-)"}
{"text":"This is the perfect little family owned deli.  
I have fond memories of yoohoos and turkey sandwiches. 

I wish there was a way to rate them 4.9 stars because cash only is a bit of a pain but I understand it is expensive to run credit and debit. 

Thank you for the fond memories and I look forward to the new senior photos from saguaro every year."}
{"text":"What a great find! I was in the area for work and a friend suggested a bunch of us go try it. SO glad we did! REALLY a great place. This family business offers SUPER food. TOUGH call. I wanted the Italian beef, the peppered steak, AND the homemade meatball. I went with the Italian beef and it was delish. EVERYBODY was pleased with their choices. A pretty good sized sandwich!  Very inexpensive and I felt like I was part of their family. They clearly LOVE what they do. HIGHLY recommended.  You don't stay in business nearly 40 years if you're not doing it right. They clearly ARE! Thanks Joe!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. This place is delicious. Family owned and operated and wonderful people at that. I wish I could take this place home with me! 
I had a cheesesteak with the works which included their AMAZING marinara sauce. Denise had me try a bite of their chicken salad that is cooked in house complete with their dressing. Ooooooo my. Moist deliciousness. The potato salad was quite yummy too. 
You cannot go wrong coming here. I'll be getting some of their cannoli's to take with me. 
Thank you fellow yelpers who guided me here! :)
They are cash only and worth every penny."}
{"text":"I am in my early 40's and have been eating here since they opened in the late 70's. Nothing has changed, the décor is the same and it's located in the same spot. Most importantly it is part of the fabric within the community. It is still owned and operated by the same family. The Husband & Wife along with their daughters work this well oiled machine to provide good quality and great tasting food to all those that walk thru the door. Everyone is treated like family weather your a 1st timer or a repeat customer like myself. I have eaten a many of cheesesteaks in what is the \"Capital\" of cheesesteaks. None and I have eaten @ all of them, make you feel welcomed as family. The food here is very good. I recommend everything! They do only take CASH! It is a no frills place that offers a good quality meal at affordable prices. You will not walk anyway hungry. It is nice to see a mom and pop place like this stand the test of time with all the crappy fast food chains near by. They have done this by making sure they serve a top quality product to all. Go enjoy a great tasting sandwich while experiencing some living history."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. A family owned deli with great food and great people. There are a lot of sandwich places that are a lot closer to where I live and I will definitely drive the 20 minutes to Casella's Italian Delicatessen again. Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good, inexpensive place to grab a sandwich and a side, and we came upon Casillas from a solid Yelp rating. You walk in and you see a restaurant steeped with history and tradition, with pictures of famous people who are there and the local high school pics. Your mouth immediately begins to water when you smell the terrific aroma of the food. Your heart is warmed when you are immediately greeted by the most friendly and down-to-earth amazing wait staff who were all too willing to give you free samples of their sides. They also told you a little about their family history (41 Years Wow ) and how all of the food is made by momma. Well, let me tell you what...we sampled all the sides and they were not only delicious, they were all unforgettable...the coleslaw was fresh and crunchy with just the right amount of savory seasoning (not too sweet or sour) it will make your palate dance. The winner for me was the potato salad. Creamy, perfectly tender cubed potatoes, a bit of celery, a dash of onion, and a mix of momma's special dressing was so insatiable, you can't stop eating it. 

But wait, there's more...the sandwiches. We both had a steak works sandwich. The bread roll was light and delightfully crunchy and filled with fresh steak diced with peppers, light and incredibly well seasoned marinara and onions and folded into the fresh mozzarella that created strings that pulled away from the bread...oh man...I literally am dreaming of going back now. I will definitely only go to Casillas for my sandwiches in the future."}
{"text":"hype, hype, hype   ...   you don't make cheesesteak with marinara sauce.  Place is old school in a very bad way.  Interior is depressing and my cheesesteak was just not any good.  The brainless in scottsdale might think the place is cool.  I just think it kind of sucks."}
{"text":"What a great \"cash only\" retro place. I ordered the cheese steak with everything and it was fabulous. I also sampled the Italian beef which was also very tasty. This is an old fashion Mom & Pop place with real character. The soda comes in cans and did I mention that it is cash only? Well, it is so leave your plastic at home."}
{"text":"After hearing about Casellas for several years and never making it there, we finally stopped today. Both had the steak sandwich with sauce and it was PHENOMENAL. Best sandwich I had in ages and the people could not be more friendly. Two thumbs and a couple of big toes up."}
{"text":"As a kid I was always a picky eater. I never liked sandwiches or cheese steaks until my parents took me here one afternoon. After this day, I was OBSESSED. I've been going here since I was young. The family who owns Casella's are so friendly, owner even gave me a free cheesecake on my 17th birthday. Now whenever my family or I are in, Denise greets us by name and asks how our family is doing."}
{"text":"While the menu is fairly straightforward with mostly a choice of hot or cold sandwiches, the execution is done well. This is an Italian Deli which seems to be frequented often by regulars and locals which is always a good sign. The customer service here seems to be very good as well in which it looks like a family run business. They only accept cash here though so keep that in mind.

I really liked their cheesesteak sandwiches and would definitely go back for them again."}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite in Scottsdale so I used the Yelp app and swung by this place.  I was a little taken aback by the location but once we got inside, it was nothing but goodness.  We had the pizza hoagie with potato salad.  Amazing.  The potato salad was nice and tangy with no celery, just the way I like it.  The pizza hoagie came with a generous amount of cheese and delicious tomato sauce.

Staff was super friendly and helpful.  Definitely a keeper.

Cash only!"}
{"text":"Came to Casella's to meet with a friend, both first timers. Immediately when I waked in I was welcomed, and thankfully a table was available right away.

Reviewed the menu for a few minutes, and was asked by \"Chris\" if I had any questions. Went over a few and she was so helpful. Explained I was waiting for a friend, and was willing to take my order ahead of time and not prepare it until my friend arrived. I also explained I wanted a separate order to go, no problem!

I ordered the Philly cheese w/peppers and extra peppers on it, with an Italian to go and cannoli. Chris introduced herself, asked me my name and about me. Felt like home here, it was great!!

Shortly after my friend arrived, and he was treated the same way! Once we received or food, our conversation was stopped several times by how authentic everything was!

The bread was toasted perfectly, everything was fresh, hot, and tasted like these were recipes carried over for years by how good it tasted!

Every staple is an Italian sandwich, not mention the cannoli. I saved these for later. (Best for last!). I couldn't wait and had to try the cannoli while driving home for the day..IT WAS SO GOOD! I've had a few cannoli's, but this one was the topper!!! I can't even explain how good it was, you just have to go get one and try for yourself!!

Couple notes to make, this place can get packed very quickly. So try to get a table as soon as possible. No cards accepted, only cash.

In all, I paid for my friend and I's lunch which cost a total of $25. That included 3 sandwiches, 2 bags of chips, and a cannoli. Very good deal for what we got.

A must go to for anyone that wants to add another family owned, authentic Italian place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Casella's is an iconic family-run sandwich shop in Scottsdale - Joe, his wife, and daughters have been running the place for decades. 

Just don't expect a typical \"deli\" - because it's not a deli, it's a sandwich shop. Reading the other reviews, this seems to confuse people who are expecting a wide array of meats sliced in front of them etc...That's not what happens here, the operation is much more simple than that, so curb your \"NY deli\" expectations... 

The interior is a throwback to the 70's, nothing has changed at all with the decor. To be honest its a bit dingy and worn, but that is also part of the charm. If you ever get to chat with Joe, you realize that Casella's is like a classic East coast joint.

Home of the original Arizona pizza steak! If you ask Joe, or just listen (he likes to tell the story), he'll tell you he brought the pizza steak to Arizona from Philadelphia. And it was worth the journey - it's really really good. 
They are also very famous for their chicken salad, and I don't know what it is about it - but it's also really really good. 
I like their bread, it's a nice soft french-style hoagie roll - and you just can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches though the pizza steak and chicken salad are my two absolute favourites. 

Aside from the hot & cold sandwiches, Cassella's also serves Italian dinners - spaghetti, meatballs, sausage etc..., and several sides like baked beans, and my personal favourite - \"the health salad\". 
The health salad is amazing. I get at least a pint of it every time. Its basically chopped celery, bell peppers, carrots etc in a sweet vinaigrette. Very basic stuff and tastes just like the Hungarian side salads I used to eat as a kid, and just like back then, I always drink \"the juice\" that is leftover when the salad is gone.

A total 70's-style dive joint that serves the best pizza steak and chicken salad subs in the valley, with a smile. 
It's no surprise you'll always find the place packed with families and kids, and Joe greeting everyone with a story. 

NOTE: Casella's is CASH ONLY and closes at 6pm."}
{"text":"I just can't say enough about this family-owned and operated authentic Italian restaurant. It is a no frills, cash only kinda place. But boy, their authentic Italian subs are just TO DIE FOR. You can tell that they have a TON of loyal followers because they were hugging every other customer that walked in the door and knew almost everyone by name. That just makes my heart sing!

As I mentioned above, it is cash only so make sure you have dolla bills in your pocket!! ;) 

You can order two different halves of the cold sandwiches which literally made my day because I could not choose! They all looked so yummy. I ordered 1/2 chicken salad and 1/2 Italian both on an AMAZING soft hoagie roll that they get delivered daily. I honestly don't know which one I liked best because they were so fantastic. The owner said that he makes 40lbs of chicken every other day, totaling about 160lbs of chicken a week JUST for their famous chicken salad. WOWZA! Their sides also look fantastic and consist of baked beans, potato salad, health salad, coleslaw, chips, pickles, etc. 

Of course, you cannot leave without purchasing Denise's famous chocolate chip cookies! 

The entire family works here and they are all just the sweetest. Joe, the father, even chased us out to say thank you for coming again! We will 100% be back soon! It is worth the drive."}
{"text":"The food is a solid five but the service and staff can be rated 1000000/5. This restaurant is locally owned and it shows.  On a hot summer day, the lady at the counter gave me a ride to a nearby location after my dehydrated, heat exhausted self ordered a Pizza Hoagie. The employees are nice folk who won't hesitate to help a fellow man (or woman) out. And yum. I sure love the Pizza Hoagie.

A lot of people come for the food and stay for the lively conversation. I stay for both. Give me more Casella's!

Keep in mind that this place only accepts cash."}
{"text":"We love supporting local businesses especially this one with amazing food and great people"}
{"text":"This is the beauty of Yelp as I would of never known about this incredible little family restaurant.  Joe and his family make  you feel like your in their home for lunch.  Tell me how many places where you find that anymore??!!  The cheese steak with grilled onions is AMAZING.  Joe told me he slices the beef (wafer thin) himself and the bread is so fresh.  The chicken salad is perfect and Mama Tina told me they roast all the chicken breasts at the restaurant.  Try their chocolate chip cookies - addicting!!  My friend took home a slice (huge) of lasagna, which comes with garlic bread, for $10 and said it was crazy good."}
{"text":"Local place that knows all their regulars and makes the rest of us feel like old friends.  As I walked in the door the owner was slicing pastrami and offered a sample as I ordered a cheese steak both were excellent quality.  Highly recommend; haven't had a disappointing item yet and far superior to the chain sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and wonderful atmosphere.  Great family business.   They were so kind to me as I celebrated my birthday.  Certainly the best Cheese Steaks west of Philly.  I recommend visiting when in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The service here is amazing. It's family owned & the daughter went way out of her way to chat & recommend things.

It's been a bit too long for me to say what it was I got for my main course, but I do remember their cannoli. They fill them to order so no worries of soggy ones to be had here. 

Just make sure you bring cash with you."}
{"text":"Had a chance to stop by on a Saturday afternoon for the first time after doing some shopping nearby.  We really like the food here at this local deli shop.  The sub was very good, and the sauce was simply amazing, probably the best around.  The homemade cookies were just as great. The owner Joe was very nice and came out to speak with us.  They just celebrated 40 years. We teased him if he started when he was five.  
Wish them many many more years!!
Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I can only vouch for the chicken salad, as it's the only thing I've ever tried in the 20 years I've been coming here. It's THAT good. I always think about trying something else, but why mess with perfection?

Walking inside gives you the sense that you've stepped into a time machine and arrived in the late 70's. I, personally, find it to be awesome. Most of Scottsdale is lacking in historic flare. And yes, the late 70s is historic by Scottsdale standards. Besides, whatever money they're not spending on updating the decor is clearly going right into their magically delicious chicken salad."}
{"text":"Always amazing. A Scottsdale landmark. Haven't been since I graduated from #SHS in 2003. Always feel like family when you walk in the door. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Seems like the ratings reflect the niceness of the owners and staff members versus the food.  They were very nice..

The chicken salad sandwich was a little heavy with the mayonnaise.  The italian sub was pretty decent, not overdone with dressing.  The italian beef was different than the style I'm used to (Chicago style), but it wasn't bad especially with the au jus that came with it.  The bread used in all these sandwiches were pretty good.  I wish they had more toppings - I like to get jalapeno or banana peppers on my sandwiches.  Seems like they have limited toppings that they would place on a given sub unless specially requested?

The sandwiches aren't bad and they're very nice people.  However, these are not $7 subs."}
{"text":"This family owned business has been in the same location for nearly 40 years.  The food is amazing, the service rocks and I love the casual feel of the place.  A big plus for me is that they use real cheese, not \"whiz\"!"}
{"text":"Seems like the old man doesn't like doing business on Sunday's... And this chicken salad that is \"life changing\" or \"to die for\" was mediocre at best... Just chicken and celery thrown into gobs of mayo. 
Definitely getting something else if I ever decide to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"There really needs to be more places like this. It's delicious, authentic, family owned and addicting. I have to come here every time I'm staying in the area. Yesterday we came in and the owner was the one to greet us and make our sandwiches and I don't remember having such friendly customer service. I already want to come back for another sandwich!"}
{"text":"My parents started going shortly after they opened, thusly I am a life long loyal customer. Best sandwiches, great meatballs, and the most wonderful rice pudding ever!"}
{"text":"Cash only but great food! Their Philly cheesesteak is amazing and their handmade meatballs are awesome. The staff is super friendly and always remembers you and asks how you're doing. Definitely suggest this place."}
{"text":"I was looking for a sandwich and ran into this place on yelp. When you walk through the door, you notice this place has an old school deli or grocery store feel. The owner was nice, very friendly and talkative. The owner had to keep announcing that this was my first time here. I found that kind of annoying, but she was just trying to be nice. They have a wide range of cold and hot sandwiches. Be warned that their \"hot\" sandwiches are warmed in a old looking microwave. They are going on 38 years and the place seems to be full of regulars. Overall, I did like the feel of the place but I thought the sandwich was just okay. This place was bit on the pricey side for what it was. They said it was all of the sandwiches are home made, but I'm not sure what of the sandwich was really home made. If I'm in the neighborhood again, I will place go somewhere else, but this place was okay to try."}
{"text":"When I go through nasty fights with a girlfriend, I go get a half of chicken salad and a works steak to make myself feel better! Its that kind of place for me! Joe and his family have been operating this place for all of the 32 years I have been here in Scottsdale. My sister and I would spend babysitting money on a pizza hogie once a week every summer. Great family, great food, great place. No frills interior, old school the whole way but perfect."}
{"text":"Way over rated! Two stars tops!

Nice people, family business but all that goes out the window soon as my food gets put into a microwave because they don't wanna use the grill? Ordered an Italian beef they put the beef into the microwave for 5 minutes? That's the quickest way to run what's claimed to be an authentic Italian beef sandwich. Obviously not authentic at all I definitely will not be back. 

Beware don't order hot subs unless you like Microwaved food. If I don't use a microwave at home why the heck would I want to Pay for Microwaved food from this place Eww. They should at least warn people they use a Microwave."}
{"text":"Went in today for potato salad, ended up getting pasta salad and Cannoli's! Wow! Amazing! This place is authentic and amazing and what a friendly staff. They make you feel right at home. This place is a must try for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Italian fare prepared exactly the way it should be.  Meatballs, Italian Beef, gravy, lasagna, and the cannoli ! You could ask for better food or nicer people.  Bon appetite !"}
{"text":"We just ate a late lunch and the sandwiches were amazing! No wonder Joe's been in business for 40 years! The chicken salad was just amazing! The Philly cheesesteak and pizza hoagie were also delicious. Joe came out and sat with us and was so friendly. Definitely would eat here often if I wasn't from out of town!"}
{"text":"I lived in this neighborhood growing up. Every now and again, I would write down my family's order, grab the cash, and peddle my way up Granite Reef to Casella's. My mom and my favorite is their chicken salad sandwich, my brother's favorite is the pizza sub, and everyone loved their AMAZING potato salad. 

The family-owned business is exactly the same today as it was when I first starting eating there nearly 20 years ago (admitting  how long it has been is hard). 

Everyone complains about them being cash-only.  They have ALWAYS been cash-only, and I like that about them.  They have quality ingredients, are always friendly when you walk in the door, and time and time again, give a great product. 

I live in Tempe now, and I go out of my way to order from them instead of the chain down the street -- gotta keep the local businesses alive!! 

LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"The first thing you notice when you enter Casella's, is the aroma of delicious Italian food. This place makes their food with love, and that is evident from the first bite. Tina, Joe and their lovely family couldn't be more welcoming and inviting.  They are so sweet!  We were visiting from Los Angeles and they made us feel like family.  Everything is homemade -the sauces, the meatballs, the bread, the rice pudding and cannolis. Absolutely delicious!  Our dogs report that the homemade dog biscuits are great! Highly recommend this Italian oasis in the desert.  Our next trip to Scottsdale definitely includes visiting Casella's - multiple times."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Casella's? It feels like home anymore. I love the Italian Sausage Sandwich with everything, I've tried everything else and it's what I keep coming back to. Casella's is about tradition; family recipes, ritual ordering, greeting everyone when you come in, paying cash."}
{"text":"Can't believe I have not reviewed this place. Casellas is a popular lunch place at my work. It is legendary and well known in the neighborhood. My usual here is the Philly Cheese Steak w Onions.. It's sooo good and pretty damn legit. Some of my coworkers like to get it with sauce. I haven't tried it but they are serious fans of it. Also, the chicken salad sandwich is great. It is made in house and you can definitely tell. 

Only two cons (and minor ones) is that they are cash only. I don't get to come here as often because of this. Secondly, they don't have soda by the fountain, only in cans. But no worries, 7-eleven is across the street to solve both of those things. Buy your fountain drink and get cash back and you're set to grab a sandwich here after."}
{"text":"My grandfather found Casella's back in the 70's. He said it reminded him of a true authentic sub he could only find back east , but even better. Our family has been enjoying Casella's every since. My favorite is the classic Italian hoagie and the chicken salad. The food is always fresh and the Casella family are so sweet and genuine. I love them as much as their food. May God bless the Casella's with health, wealth and prosperity.  Thank you for your awesome decades of service."}
{"text":"Have you ever walked into a place and everyone knows you and greets you ? That is Casella's ! This family run business has been here for years ! My favorite pizza hoagie and cheese steak ! The rest of my family loves the pastrami and simple ham and cheese ! This place has never got to big for its britches and knows the value of true customer service !"}
{"text":"This Italian deli is one of the best restaurants. Family owned business for nearly 40 years. The food is delicious and the service is even better. I liked it so much that I ate here two days in a row. I would highly recommend. Cannot wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I could eat the turkey subs here everyday if I could. One of the best subs I've ever had...and I eat them pretty frequently. The half sub is only 3.50, which is pretty cheap in my book. 
This is family owned, so you always get greeted with a smile and a hello. Quick service.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they only take cash, they close at 3 and are closed on Sundays and for weeks in the summer, which for me is a little troublesome..But I gaurantee the food makes up for it!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to this establishment. It came recomended to me by my co-worker who's brother went almost everyday while living here and in high school down the road. I had to go to the costume shop just next door and she told me to look for this place. Thought I would give it a try.

After reading several reviews on Yelp, it helped me to decide this was the place to get my lunch. I walked in and Tina was eager to welcome me and quickly take my order. I mentioned that it was my first time and knew they were a cash only establishment so I wanted to make sure I stayed within the cash that I had on hand.

Got a half Italian with onion and just the way they make it. Nothing extra or added. DELISH!!! The aroma from the oil blended with the herbs were the first thing that I smelt when opening the sandwich. The bread was soft and contents were fresh!

I opted to get a side of potato salad from reading the reviews of it. OMG!!! I don't know that anything can take me away from NOT ordering that every time I come back. The potatoes are cut almost like an au gratin type cut which makes it so nice and filling (even with the small cup that you are served). It was creamy and the blend of sweet and tart made it just a wonderful delight!! Who doesn't love a good potato salad!

Next I got a cannolli. Being born on Long Island, New York and going back to visit family, that every time you go you have to visit the bakery to get fresh cannollies to bring them home to the parents back in Arizona. THIS CANNOLLI WAS EVERYTHING THE REVIEWS SAID THEY WERE. The cream was just sweet enough filled all the way though the shell (the way it should be!!!) and creamy as can be. PERFECTION!!! I just found my new place to get my parents their craving for New York style cannollies!

When I get the craving for a sandwich, I'll be putting this place on the map of go to places first!! To get all that I did on just over $7.00 for lunch it was perfect!

My co-worker is now planning on visiting for dinner for her and her husband tomorrow night on her way home!"}
{"text":"I stopped by today on a whim because of the good reviews here and it's fairly close to my work. Everyone there was very friendly and helpful and the food was great. The portions and price are outstanding for Scottsdale. There is something nostalgic about the decor also. The wood paneling and all. I hope they never change that. it's like visiting my in law's house"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years, ever since high school and still have the best sandwiches around! I moved to California a year ago but always try to make a pit stop here when I'm in town :) oh and for the newbies bring cash because they don't take cards."}
{"text":"Friendly, family run sandwich shop with great food & old school ambiance. Cash only!"}
{"text":"Casella's has 99 5-star reviews, and I'm the 100th! By far, the most quality sandwich I've had in all of Arizona. Found Casella's through Yelp, while looking for a sandwich in the Scottsdale area. 

Plus: The meat, cheese, white roll, and mayo were very good on my cold Ham sandwich.

Plus: Locally owned/operated (not a chain). The woman that took the order was nice and helpful.

Plus: $6.10 for a full sandwich. Reasonably priced, especially for the size. 

Plus: They sell Yoo-Hoo, which quenches your thirst!

Plus: The senior class panoramic photos of Saguaro High School almost made me wish I was a Sabercat too.

Negative: The menu isn't on Yelp, and it should be! A picture of the menu is on urbanspoon.

Neutral: The décor of Casella's reminds me of Sam's butcher shop on the Brady Bunch, but  without the butcher counter. Very 1970s.

Neutral: Should highlight the \"half sandwich\" more. The full is pretty large, and if I'd seen the half on the menu, I would have ordered it.

Neutral: Don't take credit cards, but most of the Yelp reviews say this, so it shouldn't be a surprise.

When I'm in the area again, I'll try the cheesesteak Marina. Sounds interesting."}
{"text":"Expect nothing from the surroundings but take a cue from the helpful owner and his staff.  I had the Philly Cheese Steak with peppers at the owners suggestion and we also ordered a roast beef sandwich.  Both were very good. High quality and flavors.  The cheese steak tasted like one from a small Italian run place in south Philly. I tried the slaw and chicken salad. The slaw was nicely balanced. The chicken salad will make anyone who wants a mayoe salad with subtle seasonings.  By the way. I am in that camp. I love a vinegary salad a lot but there is something comforting in a chicken salad that makes me think of my mom.  Go here enjoy the food."}
{"text":"You walk in and immediately think you've entered an Elks lodge.  The food is solid but I'm not sure it is good or unique enough to pull you away from the gravitational pull of the two superior Italian delis in the area, Defalco and Andreoli.  Also, that 'Cash Only'  policy isn't earning any customer service awards."}
{"text":"As the name says, it's a deli.  A hoagie shop.  And it blows the chains (Subway, Quiznos, etc) out of the water.

It's a family-owned place.  The staff is very friendly and nice, and go out of their way to be helpful.  They know several of their customers by name.  They have several kinds of hot and cold sandwiches, and you can customize them any way you like.  I had the \"chicken steak\", and had them melt provolone on it, and add marinara, onions and peppers.

The portions are large, and the price is quite reasonable.

Oh...and they \"import\" cheesecake from NYC.  It's really good too.

Don't let the simple decor fool you.  The chairs and tables are cheap, but the food is really good.  They do close early, so be warned.  3pm on Sat, and 6pm Mon-Fri.  Closed Sun.  Cash only."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous posts.  I was looking for a reasonably priced, but delicious lunch and found this place on yelp.  They were celebrating their 35th year anniversary and were thrilled to find out I was visiting for the first time.  I met the owner Joe and his wife Tina.  They make a point of introducing themselves and making you feel very welcome.  You can taste-test all of their salads.  (Their chicken salad and baked beans are delicious) I am so glad for yelp helping me find all of these little gems that would have remained hidden!
BTW, cheese steak is amazing.  Got the works and it is delicious."}
{"text":"4.5  Well after hearing a favorite former yelper sing the praises of the hot Italian beef, I finally made it in, cash in hand since no plastic.  I like that the place had not seen a decorator in 34 years.  Actually, I don't think it saw one then.  In a deli, I'm looking for a good sandwich for a good price.  I'm not interested in paying $17.95 for a turkey sandwich so they can recoup the cost of an overpriced interior designer.

And I got just that.  An excellent Italian beef sandwich as well as the biggest pickle I have ever seen.  And in following my new half-star policy, bumping up to 5 stars because the gals at the counter were so welcoming to everyone who came in.  And Mr. Casella himself took the time to say hello while we were waiting.  They also run a buy 2-get 1 free special during the week late afternoons."}
{"text":"Before there was a Defalco's or any of the trendier places around town, there was Casella's. I know this because it's been around almost as long as I have been and I grew up in the neighborhood. The Valley National Bank next door is long gone and the strip center has remodeled, but the deli is in the same spot. I have memories of being sent on my bike with a few bucks by my mom to pick up some subs for the family when she didn't want to cook. So how does it stack up today? Our family came back for lunch. 

It has not changed much over the years. The same 1970s paneling is on the walls, and the Saguaro senior class photos still dominate the decor. 

The primary difference between the sausage sub I ate in my youth to the one I had yesterday is the bread today is better: a solid crunch on the roll while still light inside. My wife's chicken steak was tasty, and the marinara is awesome. I didn't get to try a bit of my parents' cold subs but they finished them both happily. 

Everyone behind the counter that I saw was a family member (again, I grew up in the neighborhood: if you went to Mohave & Saguaro in the 70s & 80's or you went to St. Maria's you knew or knew of the Casella's) and this means they will close for summer vacation in July and close during the Christmas holidays to take a break. And yes, it's still cash only. But coming here for lunch felt like coming home. I may live in Texas now, but my heart will always be in this part of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Great customer service! I had the pizza hoagie and wow it was delicious! I've never had a pizza hoagie before but I'm glad I chose it because it was super tasty and I'll defiantly be back for another on in the future! This is my new favorite sandwich joint! BRING CASH!"}
{"text":"I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'! 

While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner. 

In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out: 

- The very friendly staff
- It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses! 
- Clean decor 
- Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see 
- A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside. 

I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular. 

Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!"}
{"text":"visitor from other state -  Outstanding and friendly staff and foods is CHAMP! Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan.

First, bring cash if you're going here.

Love the Italian family atmosphere. Run by the same family for many years, and it shows. Food was great, and the counter person, a daughter of the owners, was very helpful and friendly. I had an Italian Beef Sandwich, and being from Chicago where the Beef Sandwich is king, I enjoyed it a lot.

It's busy as hell at lunch time, but the family crew moved like a well-oiled machine to get everyone their food in a very reasonable amount of time.

My one, and only real con. Cash only. It's time to step up to modern retailing and accept credit cards. Luckily, I had cash when I went in, but I saw customers walk out because they weren't carrying enough to cover their purchase.

Definitely, check it out, and bring cash."}
{"text":"We are in town for spring training and I found this place on Yelp. So glad we did. Joe is the friendliest guy you'll ever meet and takes so much pride in his food and business. The restaurant is about to celebrate its 39th anniversary. We got the cold Italian hoagie, health salad and Denise's chocolate chip cookies. The meat in the sandwich was amazing and what a bargain. You can get half a cold sandwich for just $3.90. My only disappointment was that the bread was a little dry. The health salad with marinated peppers, cucumber, carrots and celery was delicious and refreshing. The cookies were delicious and homemade (2 for $1!). Happy to support a great family business!"}
{"text":"Love to find these places, 40 years of family owned and operated goodness! The staff/owners were very friendly and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp. Had never eaten in the neighborhood before. Most people write about how nice the staff here is and they are right. Nicest people to ever run a deli. Their meatball sub is also amazing!"}
{"text":"37 years and counting! Casellas is one of the best lunch spots in town. Family owned and operated, always friendly and the food is consistently delicious. The Pastrami sandwich and the Cheesesteak are both excellent but don't forget to try the potato salad and their home made cannoli!"}
{"text":"Wrote about this before, but in case you're wondering if the place has lost its edge, the short answer is NO!!!!

Absolutely the BEST place for sandwiches and Italian dishes - all homemade.  Jump in the car, climb on the bike ... but GO!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here since i was a kid and will be taking my son here too! I love that they keep it simple and its family run. The chicken salad is the best."}
{"text":"You simply can't find a more delightful hostess.   She is the daughter of the owners and calls everyone by their first name and really goes out of her way to ensure that the customers are welcomed and enjoying their Italian deli food.  I had the steak and cheese which was delicious.  The steak was such high quality meat and the cheese was delicious as well.  The homemade lemonade was perfect.  My only advice to the owning family is to buy a machine to serve soft drinks on tap which is always so delicious with sandwiches.  The atmosphere is a cute ma and pa place which reminds all customers, \"You're not in a Subway.\"  Come here for great food and a fun time."}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been here several times now. Looks like it is family-owned and operated. They seem to really care about the place and their customers.

An old-school hoagie shop which reminded me of similar places in Philly and NJ.

Food is really good, fast and very reasonably priced.

Very casual atmosphere. Very busy at lunch, sometimes empty at other times.

Service is extremely friendly and genuine.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this family owned Italian deli.  They are the cooks and that staff, and they always remember your name, even when you have not been their in years.  Love the photos of the senior classes from Saguaro High School, definitely supports the locals.  Get the chicken salad sandwich or the chicken steak, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Eating at Casella's is like coming home to a home-cooked meal - if you live in Philly and have great cooks in your family.  No wonder they just celebrated 40 years in business.
People: The Casella family is so unbelievably nice! I met Dad and the two daughters who were working that day. They are friendly and welcoming to everyone; he even came and sat at my table to chat. 5 stars for the owners.
Food: Oh.my.word! I ordered a beef sandwich with peppers and onions. They showed me the paper-thin beef before they cooked it to perfection and served it on a beautifully soft white roll. My mouth was full of deliciousness. They also offered samples from their selection. The coleslaw was not too sweet and not overdressed, so very good. The chicken salad sample had a bit too much creaminess for my liking, but was still flavorful. They make everything from scratch (except the pickles) and I look forward to trying more offerings. 5 stars for the sandwich alone.
Ambience: This is a no-frills environment, but it's light and clean and full of lovely people. One wall is covered with pictures of the graduating classes of Saguaro High School since the 80s - because that's where all 4 daughters attended - so 5 stars for hometown appeal.
I simply can't wait to go visit again and say \"Hi!\" to my new family."}
{"text":"Remember when l told what a nice family the Casellas were.
Oops!  I was wrong. The two bratty rude sisters did not seem to appreciate loyal longstanding customers. The average food seemed to taste better when some kindness is there. What phony's!"}
{"text":"Always fresh delish food, that has a reputation known by all in the area. I have a business across the street and all my clients rant about the food from here. When you step inside you will feel like your welcomed as a part of this family that runs this business. Simply extraordinary to be so lucky to come by a establishment ran such as this. Scottsdale's little secret among best food one can find and top ran business!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks Shannon M. for turning me onto this place.  The meatball sandwich was fantastic.  Loved the family owned and operated service."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Casella's for years!! I used to live down the street and go more often then I do now but even when I'm in the area, I try and stop by. The decor is old but if you look past that, you will discover the family friendliness and food are incredible! I usually order the turkey sub but their chicken salad sub is THE BEST! Unfortunately, this place isn't super healthy but boy is it tasty!

Just remember to bring cash because they don't accept anything else!!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this little hole in the wall. I bet I have driven by this place many times and never knew it was there. Yes, it is cash only but if you know that before you go, what is the big complaint? This is a family business. The interior reminds me of many of the Italian restaurants in Buffalo, NY, wood panels, tables and metal chairs, nothing fancy but this is a sandwich place, I don't need fancy, I need good. 

The two women asked my name, welcomed me and I placed my order to go. I ordered an Philly Cheese steak with onions and a chicken salad sandwich. Both were delicious. The bread is the best roll I have had in Phoenix. Just like back east. Out here in Phoenix the bread they serve at sandwich places is...YUCK, kind of subway sandwich bread. To me the roll is important and this one hit the spot. 

Very casual, limited hours, Monday Thru Friday, 11Am to 6Pm, Saturday, 11Am to 3PM. I am definitely a regular now."}

{"text":"The chicken salad sandwich is life changing! I mean life changing!! I can not believe that it took me so long to write my review. I guess I to busy California dreaming about another sandwich! My fiancé brought me to Scottsdale for my birthday so we were yelping all over the place!

We both ordered sandwiches from this place and I have to say it s a GEM the owner knew Lot of people who walked in and was super super nice and was happy to give suggestions so I landed on the chicken salad sandwich. And I haven't stopped thinking about that sandwich since.

Unfortunately I can't even remember what my fiancé got because I made a pig of myself and demolished my sandwich I gave my fiancé a look and dared him to ask for a bite lol. I kid I kid I shared. I usually do share upon request 

This place is local and it's always great to support local business even if you are not from the area and the fact that they have good service and and GREAT FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"Small mom and pop deli with very friendly owners that work there.  Had the pastrami, which was very good along with potato salad."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful, friendly people, and the service is wonderful. This place deserves a six star rating. A must try!"}
{"text":"I first visited this establishment in 1981 back when we were able to leave high school for lunch. It was a favorite until I moved in 1982. After 35 years of being deprived of the best family made subs in town, today's steak and cheese was fantastic, and just as it was back in school. I hope to get another visit in for the Pizza Hoagie before I leave. Sometimes good things never change.

10/22/17. Today I had the Pizza Hoagie before heading back out to Florida. Wow...just as it was 35 years ago, Fantastic. Can't say enough good comments about Casellas. Thanks again Joe for being who you are :)"}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches. A bit slow but authentic mom and pop place, I'll go back for sure. I have the sausage sandwich, hot. Their chocolate italian cookies were very good as well."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich. Good pasta salad. And it's a fantastic throwback style place and the people are really nice."}
{"text":"This is a very good daily highly recommended I wanted to get some fresh meat I ended up getting cheese and bread and couple sandwiches and the people that got them for they were also very happy prices were reasonable and the service was great I highly recommend this place I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"We aren't part of the Casella family, but we feel like we are when we visit this traditional family deli. The chicken salad sandwiches are legendary, but the sausage and peppers are my favorite. And don't forget the deli pickles.
Sort of like being back east."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Old school feel, almost feels like I am back in philly. Staff is so friendly and it is a family run place. I have had the pastrami which is delicious and also had a turkey sandwich. Bread is what makes this sandwich. I want to try more of what they have. Will go back. You should go try, if have not already"}
{"text":"I don't see what the hype is all about with this place. I didn't think my meal was that great. Nothing I couldn't put together quickly at home. The place is old. And seriously, cash only? 

The man behind the counter was nice. The other lady that was there seemed nice."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by several Yelpers on the Talk board, so I decided to give it a shot for lunch one day.  Since everyone recommended the Italian Hoagie, I decided to order it.

The Bread on the Hoagie was pretty good, but I thought it was a little on the dry side.  Would have enjoyed a little more Oil in it.  The ingredients tasted fresh and it was a solid Sandwich.....not the best I ever had, but pretty good.  Will have to come back to try some of their other stuff.

They're not open on Sundays, so I'll have to try and squeeze in a visit during the week.

{"text":"This place is incredible. The food is good, but what puts this deli over the top are the people there. When you walk in you're treated like family. The owner John came and sat down with us and shared all sorts of stories. The lady working the front counter, Denise, was so nice and friendly. She was delightful. It really felt like family. You've got to experience this place for yourself. The chicken salad is a must have ;)"}
{"text":"While I love each and every visit to Casella's, today was something special - Casella's was celebrating an anniversary - 34 years in business!!

There is something to be said about good food and a friendly atmosphere that stands the test of time.  It is easy to see why this family-run business has been open for 34 years and counting.

Since first discovering this local gem with my Favorite Yelper a few months ago, I have lost count of the number of visits we have made.  Each and every time, we are greeted like family.  Denise even remembers our order!  Well, to be honest, every customer is greeted like family.  That is one of the many reasons we can't stay away.

The decor is unpretentious, and the wood-paneled, nostalgia-filled walls tell the story of years of being a staple in the community.  Don't be surprised if you are offered a taste of whatever is being sliced behind the counter - thank you again Joe, for that Provolone!  :)

Ready to taste a little bit of heaven?  Order the Hot Italian Beef with Provolone.  Served on a soft yet slightly crisp roll with a side of Au Jus, I struggle to find words to describe how good this sandwich is.  Just try it.  You won't be sorry.  

Maybe money can't buy you love, but it can get you a fantastic meal - Casella's is cash-only.

I have decided that I want to be adopted by the Casella family.  Sorry mom, but if you ever taste one of Casella's sandwiches, you will understand..."}
{"text":"I went there based off yelpers. I got the steak works. I just was not impressed. It tasted ok. But I felt it was a little over priced for what I got. It did not come with any sizes. A pickle is a $1 extra. And the cannot lies were way over priced at 3$. 1.50$ would have been a better price. I get 8t they fill it to order so it is not soggy, but it still just a cannolli. So I give the food a two star. The people are super nice. So I gave them an extra star for that. Sorry no pictures. My photo was at 3 % and would not let me take a pic."}
{"text":"Casella's is better than Subway, but nothing particularly special.  The 4.5 star review it has is extremely inflated.  I didn't write a review for a long time, because I feel bad since it's a family business, and I do wish them the best of luck.  However, I don't like when businesses have undeserved high ratings.  It's not worth the trip to the ATM beforehand to pay cash only.  If you happen to be at Basha's next door, and are hungry for a sightly better than Subway sub, and have some cash on hand, it's not a bad experience.  If you aren't already in the area, however, it's not worth the extra effort."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! Stopped in here with my boys while we were out exploring the Scottsdale area and boy did we luck out! It's the perfect little family owned shop. The rolls were soft & fresh, the meatballs perfectly seasoned & the cheesesteaks were moist and delish! They're very filling too so we all took half our food with us to enjoy later! The pizelle (spelling) cookies are super light & have the perfect sweetness to them, I could eat a whole bag. YUMMY!! It's not always easy pleasing all 3 of my boys when eating out & I get so tired of my youngest eating chicken fingers or mac & cheese so I absolutely loved this little gem!! The family that runs it are the friendliest people ever. If you're in the area, go & enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"This is your classic old school family run joint - The Cheers of Italian delis. The food is great, but the people running the place is first class, checking on you throughout the meal and engaging in conversation. Most of the food review has been hit already, but the chicken salad, Italian and pastrami were huge hits in our group.

Couple of tips:
- Cash only!
- If you're coming during a holiday weekend, be sure to call! We lucked out coming Friday before the Memorial Day weekend, but they're closed for the rest of the long weekend.
- Try the cannoli. They fill as you order it (like you're supposed to) so it's not soggy like a lot of other places."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Very homey, friendly and delicious! We had cheese steak sandwich and meatball sandwich there. They put some homemade tomato sauce on the top of sandwich. It was great! It was good big portion and very reasonable prices. Especially this summer, they have special deal 2-6pm B2G1! You should try!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to grab a sub! Highly recommend! They've been here forever and always make the best food"}
{"text":"Wow. What a sandwich. I have tried 3 things here. 

The Italian hoagie was pretty good. Lots of meat, but very oily. Like my hands were drenched. But no big deal. 

The chicken salad sandwich. This is my favorite!!!!! Omg its so good! Freaking delicious. 

Pasta salad. Great side order for your sandwich. Very tasty. 

Biggest problem with the place (and the reason I don't give it 5 stars) is that they only accept cash. Come on, what kind of place doesn't take credit cards these days? First time there I didn't have any on me & i had to drive all the way back home & come back since I already put my order in. Annoying. 

But give it a try some time. Very homey feeling too. Mom & pop sort of place."}
{"text":"The cheesesteaks are to die for. Every Friday is tradition to have Cassela's cheesesteaks, taste just like the ones in Philly. Get it with sauce and grilled onions :) the bread rolls are the secret I think. They get them specially made from a bakery and stop selling once they run out for the day. It feels like family when you walk in and everything on the menu is amazing. Remember that it's cash only!   A great part of going to Saguaro High School is hearing about Cassela's and then once graduating seeing the picture of your graduating class added to the wall.   There's nothing like Cassela's :)"}
{"text":"Their meatball subs are fantastic. I know I should try their other food but once I had that sub I was hooked! Pre-sub I enjoyed lasagna, spaghetti, and a nice variety of pickled and pasta salads. The family is great, they will even open the doors if you show up at closing time which we once did. Love the photo of Papa Casella with the Pope."}
{"text":"Joe and he family are a hidden gem in a world where food and experience no longer meet in one place. The food was incredible. Be prepared to bring cash as no Credit but this makes the hidden gem that much more precious. I would put this place on my bucket list of Scottsdale treasures. 40 years strong and I see why. Thank you Casellas for making my trip. Casellas has all homemade food and you can tell it is made with love. 5 star rated great price and even more amazing family dynamic lost in many Delis nationwide. MUST GO TO!!!! If I lived here I would be a regular. Thank you Casellas"}
{"text":"Now I wish I would have actually gone to pick up my samich instead of sit at work and wait for it's arrival.  I had heard very good things about this deli, so when i finally got bored of the same ole lunch I bring to work every day it was time to get in on this following.  I had the italian sub on wheat bread.  Um, talk about Freshness!  I'm pretty sure I ate the whole thing in like 3 minutes because I just couldn't get enough.  The bread was so soft, the meat was outstanding, and the provolone was real!  Alll it had was oil and vinegar on it with lettuce tomato and the typical italian meats.  I normally cannot eat a sandwhich without mayo and mustard, specially some spicy brown.  That was wonderful, but now after reading these reviews, it's time for me to check out that Chicken Salad, I love chicken salad."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since highschool! Great friendly neighborhood deli with amazing sandwhiches!!"}
{"text":"Everything is really good, meatball sandwich is exceptional. True home cooking, family business. This is a must eat at place !"}
{"text":"Superb neighborhood deli!  Delicious quality food, great value, fast friendly service!"}
{"text":"My only regret is that I have just now found this place. In business for over 35 years. Walking in for the first time and I was welcomed as if I was visiting their home. I was introduced to the owners and two of their four daughters. \"Everything is homemade\", they proudly proclaimed! I was handed a taste of their special chicken salad and I will never eat chicken salad anywhere else! Joe the owner said he personally debones the chicken daily and his wife has the secret sauce recipe. Their meat for the chesse steaks are all hand cut, no precut steak-ums here. Canollis are hand made to order so they arent soggy. Gotta try it! Oh, cash only by the way. There is a Basha's in the center if you need to go grab a pack of gum to get cash back! Im going again today. tee hee"}
{"text":"Thanks Hailey P. for the heads up, that they are a cash only business. Kids enjoyed their cold subs to go. Don't leave without a bag of pizelles, they were excellent!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Noticed the great reviews so I had to give it a try. Excellent food and service! Family owned, the owners are genuine and very friendly. The Steak works is sooo good! Highly recommended!! FYI place is cash only"}
{"text":"The real deal Italian deli. The cheesesteak and Italian beef sandwich were both fantastic. Friendly establishment.....expect the owners to come chat with you and find out where you're from."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get real home cooked deli food... Meatballs, Roast Beef, Chicken Salad, Baked Beans... And a host of other delicious food.. All home cooked, prepared and served by the wonderful and friendly Casella family."}
{"text":"In town for a short weekend trip and wanted a quick lunch.  Saw the reviews on Yelp and figured we had to give it a try.   Well, we loved it.    The service is amazing and friendly.   Joe, the owner, and his daughter, were lovely to chat with.     

Food is fresh and prepared when you order."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to write this review without telling a story. I normally don't write dissertations, favoring the short and sweet condensed review, so if it's a little verbose, bear with me as it's a story worth reading.

We've heard about Casella's for years but have never eaten there, usually due to bad timing on our part as they close early on Saturday and are not open for business on Sundays. 
We finally made it there today during normal business hours.

Not knowing what to expect, we decided prior to going in if we weren't impressed with the menu, or the joint itself, we'd give each other the signal and find another lunch place.
Well we weren't impressed with the decor, the menu or the overall ambiance, so we gave each other the nod and started for the door. 
That's when the owner, Joe Casella stopped us.
Recognizing us as newbies, he told us all about his restaurant,  the menu, and even offered us a taste of whatever we liked.
We declined, perhaps being a bit skeptical.
But then something interesting happened. 
Joe introduced us to his wife and two of his four daughters (who were on duty) and we were instantly enamored with this family. 
Who does that in 2011? Seriously. He asked our names and even shook my hand. 
Long story short, after talking with Joe for just a few short minutes, my wife and I gave each other a reverse nod, signaling our eagerness to try something...anything! 
We ordered a couple sandwiches on Joe's recommendation.
The food was superb.
The bread was one of the best rolls I've ever had and is enough reason by itself  to keep us coming back. Crusty and not overly breaded, it reminded me of the rolls in Atlantic City where the bread is pure perfection. 
Same for the sandwich ingredients, full of flavor and cooked just right.

But the best part was how Joe came over to talk to us after finishing our meal. He wanted our candid opinion of the food and service.
If there's any single reason for me to frequent this place, it's the genuine heartfelt sincerity of the owner and his family, not to mention the food!

Sure, the decor is old and needs updating, but somehow, after meeting the family, and eating lunch, I didn't care about the decor, or the no-nonsense menu, or the layout. None of that mattered anymore. 
What mattered was the overall experience of a true family restaurant, their wholesome foods, and being in the company of genuinely warm people. 

In a time when most of us tend to rely on first impressions, judging the proverbial book by its cover almost caused us to miss out on the Casella's experience had it not been for Joe Casella taking our hand and welcoming us into his unique domain.

Casella's took me back in time today, when my grandparents would often take me with them to the Italian deli for lunch. 
As they visited with the owner (in Italian), sipped espresso for what seemed like hours, and ate a slow lunch, I wanted to die. I remember sitting there in the booth fidgeting as they talked, hoping like hell we'd get out of there soon.
I hated that experience as a kid.
I loved it today as an adult, but more importantly, finally recognized and appreciated the gift my grandparents unknowingly gave me. 
Thank-You Joe"}
{"text":"I will gladly drive 40 miles from my house to Casella's for their food.

They have become my top stop Italian deli.

Recently, I tried their Italian and cheesesteak sandwiches.  Both were awesome.

I also love their salads.  I had the pasta and chicken salad.  The chicken salad receives my only small complaint, because it is a little too thick for my taste.

Maybe they need to ease up on the mayonnaise or something.  I don't know.

This place gets extremely busy around lunch time, but the service is quick.  Try to remember that they do not take debit / credit cards or checks.  Cash is king.

The Casella family is like a well-oiled machine: dad runs around, making sure everything is orderly and clean, while mom and the daughters handle cooking, food prep, and the front counter.

I simply love this place....even more than DeFalco's."}
{"text":"Family owned. Great people, great service and great sandwiches. Get the Pizza Hoagie but add a meatball to it!"}
{"text":"The women who work and run this spot are so sweet. Great little locals spot. If you want to just come grab a quick Sammie in this area this is your spot."}
{"text":"FAMILY!! Small Italian deli that's perfect. Very friendly & welcoming, casual & awesome. It like stopping by your Dad & Mom's house while your cousins/ siblings are hanging out.  The food is fresh & just like you would make @ home.
Meatball sandwich was perfect (bread was crispy outside & soft inside) not messy & very tasty. 
Denise's cookies are terrific."}
{"text":"If we lived near here, we would be coming here every week! Family owned and operated and everyone is SO friendly. You hardly ever find places anymore that people actually take the time to say hi and get to know you. We ordered the hot pastrami and the cheesesteak with the works. Both were so delicious and came on amazing rolls! The coleslaw and pasta salad were both very good as well. This place is definitely worth going out of your way for- we will be back!"}
{"text":"What a treat! Owned and operated by the same family for 40 years. Amazing sandwiches and couldn't have been a more friendly guy. We came in with a large group, he and his daughter turned out sandwiches out in no time. When I'm back in then Phoenix area I'll definitely be back I'm looking forward to trying the steak sandwich. The meatball sandwich has homemade sauce and I quote \"not made from Prego, Ragu or that other stuff!\" The sandwich takes a slight bit of a different approach as the meatballs are chopped rather than whole. 
Check out Casella's I'm sure they'll make you a fan."}
{"text":"I made a mistake and got a boring old turkey sub.  It was good, but I should've ordered something different.  The meat is fresh and the bread is true Italian bread! Great find!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp and based on the reviews I had great expectations. I liked that it was a locally owned business and that it was rather simple. Everyone on Yelp recommended the Philly Cheese steak. It definitely wasn't anything special, the meat was a little dry, the bread wasn't authentic cheese steak break but rather what you would find on any sub. I haven't had a cheese steak I like that uses provolone instead of whiz. The one awesome thing that came out of the experience was their homemade dog biscuits. My dog loved them and they were made of all natural ingredients."}
{"text":"Some friends took me here while I was in town from LA. Great sandwiches and from what I understand this is a family owned and operated business. I hear that their lasagna is good too. I'll have to try that next time for sure... 
PS- The price is right here. In LA I would have been stuck paying double for the cold cuts."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They're always so friendly and welcoming.  I've been coming here for years and I always love when I am near by to grab a delicious sandwich and lemonade!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!!!!!  My company recently moved to the area and I'm always scouting for lunch places.  I found this place on yelp, read the reviews, found zero reviews below 4 stars, then I see locals frequent this place, you know it's legit.  Cash only, no worries.  I ran into WalMart, grabbed something and got cash back.  Super friendly staff, which seems to be the daughters of the family, all very friendly and attractive.  I will definitely be bringing my team members here for lunch."}
{"text":"This deli is in the Basha's shopping center on the corner of Granite Reef & MacDonalds facing toward Granite Reef.  Went there based on the reviews from yelp and was looking for a good hero with Italian bread.  I will not go back.  The place is very dirty and not at all inviting.  They did not slice the meat in front of me like I am used to with deli's the meat was in a cooler with the cheeses and condiments.  The same lady who does the cash register also makes your sandwiches and she does not wear gloves or washes her hands, very disgusting to eat food which someone handles money and then makes your sandwich without washing their hands.  The cashier did mention everything is homemade by her father which I had to wonder since they have boxes of food in their freezer not home made but the cheescake comes from someplace else.  The salads and rice pudding looked disgusting.  I know they just celebrated their 38th year but I wish they went back to when they had the slicer out and sliced the meats in front of you and washed their hands before service.  Not a good place to go for fresh food.  The hero was good my friend said I told him I would not eat it because the lady had dirty hands, but he ate it and like it.  if you go ask the lady to wash her hands first, not sure if she will but then ask her to use gloves if they have none, then you know what kind of establishment it is.  Good heros bad etiquette. They operate the same way as subway except subway employees wear gloves.  Want an authentic NY Hero from Subway just bring in a Hoagie roll and they will make you a sandwich, it is all about the bread. Casellas also raised their prices now a 6 inch Hero with roast beef and cheese is $7.65... no more $6 Heros.  Not worth it especially since their are other options and the food or the employees wash their hands or wear gloves elsewhere. Bacteria is terrible to get from someone not have the decency to wash their hands and touch food.  Disgusting, Disgusting, Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"Super nice people and outstanding food make this family owned non-pretentious sandwich shop a stand out.  I think it is a Mom and Pop with a few daughters running the place. They are all super sweet.  

The cheese steak is out of this world.  It is not your Philly style cheese steak. But it is a must have for me.  The meatball and Italian beef subs are a close 2nd choice.  And the cold Italian Combo sub, also delicious!  And I dig the yummy potato salad.  And definitely do not miss out on the amazing cookies ... off the hook!!  

They close at 6 PM, so hurry up and call in your order!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome. just moved to the city and wanted to grab some good food with a buddy, found this place and saw it had good reviews so we gave it a try. 

We told the cashier we hadnt been there before and she tooks us through the menu and was super friendly. she went on to tell us how everything was fresh and store prepared. everything was made to order. 

while we were waiting, the owner came over and gave us samples of different dishes and told us what he recommended. he told us how the company started and where he came from.

the food came out and it was amazing. got the roast beef sandwich and it was easily the freshest roast beef I've ever had. after we ate, the owner showed us how he prepared everything fresh and why he did things the way he does. 

we went for lunch and left with a new favorite spot where we were treated like family. 

Thanks Chris and Joe, we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I have so many wonderful things to say about this place and not enough time. I am from the wonderful city of Chicago and let me tell you, I've had my fair share of AMAZING Italian food and this place fits right in.
The Casella family is welcoming and insanely friendly. I had great conversation while waiting for my beef. This very adorable family owned restaurant not only offers fabulous customer service but there Italian Beef was outstanding. The best I've had in the valley. I have been searching all over Phoenix for a Italian joint like this and I've finally found it. I have not yet tried other items on the menu but if they are as great as the Italian Beef, I'll be spending a lot of my time and money here. 



Kudos to the Casella family for a fabulous run restaurant with great food!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an excellent sandwich or hoagie go to Casella's. We ordered the Italian sandwich and pizza hoagie. Both were EXCELLENT! The atmosphere is a great family vibe. Can't wait to go back and try more sandwiches!"}
{"text":"What can I say about Casellas...feels like home. You walk in from when it was 1987, 1997, or 2017...the place is the same. Warm, friendly greeting, family run establishment with the 2 girls I remember running the front while mom and dad in back. Specialty is the cheese steak..pepper steak...in fact any hoy steak sandwich. The Italian sandwich is epic. All of the homemade sides are amazing and the price is just right. If you are in the area, stop by, nothing fancy to expect from the building itself but the food is what Lunch dreams are made of. Closed on Sundays and they deserve it...great sandwich/deli. After 40 years...and still going strong. Iconic place for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wow... An unbeatable combination of homemade sandwiches that melt in your mouth and service that's second to none. We will be back. Best lunch I can remember in years."}
{"text":"This was the first stop for lunch upon arriving in Scottsdale from Toronto.

I wasn't blown away but I will agree with other yelpers that the staff was very friendly and they seemed to know everyone who came in. 

I'll start with the positives: 
- very inexpensive...the hot Italian beef with jus was only 7 bucks! 
- also got a half chicken salad sandwich (nice to be able to order half sizes for the cold sandwiches (note you can't do that with the hot sandwiches though)
- the cannoli was delicious!
- very friendly place that seemed to bring a lot of locals

The not so great if I am being picky
- I really don't like when the person handling the money touches the food. After I paid (cash only by the way) she took the sandwich and cut it in half and arranged it in the basket for us without gloves or washing hands first
- sandwiches were just ok, but commensurate with the price so I am not complaining.

All in all a cute joint and friendly but I likely would not be back."}
{"text":"So good. Love their chicken salad sandwich, Italian, turkey, club, potatoe salad, spaghetti, and cookies.  So much goodness here."}
{"text":"Just like home! If you live here but are from Philly/South Jersey you will feel like family! Best hoagies and cheesesteaks in AZ!"}
{"text":"Buddy and I split half Pepper-steak and half Meatball with potato salad and extra marinara for my Meatball.  It was DELICIOUS.  Great service and very friendly.  I enjoyed how it was a CASUAL PLACE. Look forward to going back and trying some other fine sandwiches and salads.  Cannoli's looked FRESH."}
{"text":"LOVE Casella's!  Its a neighborhood classic.  The chicken salad, cheesesteak, turkey and potato salad are my favorites although having tried pretty much everything, you really cant go wrong.  Casella's is a family owned and operated restaurant.  Have a cannoli for dessert and tell Joe & Co. I said hi!"}
{"text":"I met fellow Yelpers Brian S and Shannon M here and learned that it's all about the sandwich.  And feeling like you have walked on to a set for \"That 60's show\" or \"That 70's Show\".  It's pretty clear the owners of Casella's are focused on the sandwiches, not updating the decor.

I had an Italian beef sandwich.  It was great.  And I sat and soaked up the 70's decor as the bread from my sandwich was soaking up the juice.

This place is old school all the way - old school awesome.  F#%*ing A.  Now where's my Trans Am?"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. My boyfriend turned me on to it and we cant get enough. For great food, friendly staff, and even better service this is the place for you"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area and had a craving for a cheese steak. Luckily I found these guys on yelp. Well worth taking the time to drive out of your way for. Definitely one of the best cheese steaks I've had in Arizona. Very welcoming and nice staff, it's all family run. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Locally owned for around twenty years this is a true neighborhood fixture. While it's not going to win any decorator awards the people and the food here are off the charts. I'm talking about some really really good homemade food! I loved this place from the moment I walked in the door. *Beware they close for family vacations and the summer."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian deli. I got a cold turkey sandwich and my bf got an Italian hoagie. Both had fresh ingredients and tasted great! New favorite sandwich place. Just remember to have cash on you. Prices are also reasonable which is a plus!"}
{"text":"My husband and are definite foodies, always looking for a great local place to eat. We stopped by Casellas for lunch and could not have been more pleased with our lunch! I had the cheese steak sandwich and my husband had the steak works with the sides of coleslaw and potato salad. It was heavenly and the family that ran the place were so friendly and kind. Clean facility, everything was fresh! A must eat!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fantastic service in a friendly family run business.  The food quality is outstanding and all made with care and passion. Prices seem too low for this quality of a product and service. I was fortunate enough to meet Joe, one of the owners and driving force behind this place.  What a treasure he is.  I had heard good things from a  friend who use to live here and went on Saturdays.  I will go back when I am in the area.  Take CASH. You will need about $15 for sandwich sides and a large drink with some left over for a tip (and the ladies deserve it).  Great place."}
{"text":"Great food, value and owners! Everything is homemade by Joe & Tina and their daughters. So refreshing to listen to the owners speak to ever customer like they are family. They knew everyone by name and took genuine interest in their life. While we were in town we visited twice. They were beyond thrilled to see us back again."}
{"text":"You have to love this place for the family and local history it has. It's refreshing in the sense it's not a cold cut franchise. The whole atmosphere is down home and welcoming. While I would like to say the food was unbelievable, I just can't. It certainly was not bad at all. It's just there are so many choices in this type of food and it didn't stand out for me. None-the-less, it's worth the visit to get a feel for what an ole time \"family run\" deli feels like."}
{"text":"Old school. Delicious. Family owned. Talk to Joe! You'll especially appreciate this place if your from back East. Philly cheese steak and chicken salad are winners."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! We had an opportunity to meet the owner and enjoy a delicious pastrami sandwich and sausage sandwich. We highly recommend this place for an authentic deli experience."}
{"text":"I've stopped by here once after I got done grocery shopping. I read the reviews and anxiously wanted to give it a try. I ordered the Casella's Italian Sub and for some reason it did not live up to what I have read in all the other reviews. Maybe Casella's was having an off day. 

I am not marking it off from my list yet. I guess i will give Casella's another try. Hopefully it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Since Arizona BBQ wasnt open i came to this mom and pop italliano deli that's celebrating 40 years...since 1977!  It's small but there is a slow but steady stream of customers coming in. Let's see what happens.....
Didn't  get what i ordered...cheese steak with peppers...no peppers to be found. Nobody likes when someone  tells them they didn't do something when they know for sure they did. Customers hate it even more (being called a liar instead of saying oops miscommunication).  I didnt turn my car around in 105 degree weather to get 30 cents worth of peppers for free,  i did it cuz owner talked it up so much i had to try sandwich at traffic light to see for myself how good the sandwich with peppers would be.
Okay. Enough soap boxing. 
The cheese steak has a very oniony tomatoe sauce with some mozzarella and it was good. I love onions.   It's a decent neighbourhood shop, but not really worth a pilgrimage for.  However, if you do go, bring cash because they don't accept any form of plastic and make sure to have them repeat order back to you!!
Giving 3 stars instead of 2 cuz i know miscommunication happens which is why they should write down the order for audit trail purposes instead of immediately assuming the customer doesn't know what they said."}
{"text":"When I was visiting Arizona, I figured that authentic Italian food would be hard to find. This place felt just like my Italian grandmother's house. When we walked in, the food smelled amazing, the owners were super friendly and the lasagna was legit."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. My first time visiting them and I will be back. Like everyone else says, make sure you have cash. I tried the Italian and meatball. Meatball was excellent and Italian was good. I'm excited to try the other options."}
{"text":"a must go! Very fresh and the ladies up front are so kind and stress that they care about you. Do go!!"}
{"text":"What a joint! Right out of German Town, Philly. If you know Steak Cheese or Deli sandwiches and chicken salad as good as grandma used to make it, then stop in here.
I lived in this town 30 years and snooped and supped, looking for the perfect Philly Cheese steak and this is it. I just happened upon the place, walked in and BAM, Joe was on me like a bird on a junebug. Pumpin' my hand, meetin' and greetin'.. 20 minutes and it like old home week. $6.80 for the real deal, full blown sandwich. Steak Cheese with pepper and onions... I had the potato salad and a dill pickle the size of your head. My wife had the Pastrami with cheese and onions, heated. She's no heavy eater so half had to come home in a bag, but she thought it to be mighty tasty as well.
Wow. I'm a goner. Thought Defalco's was good but since Greasy Tony's is no more this is tops in my book. It's a deli, so no valet parking!! It's cash only and that's okay by me 'cause it ain't pricey. They been in the same plkace 37 years and it's the first time I ever heard of the place. Shame on me and the Arizona Republic...
The sauce is super... I didn't have the meatball sandwich, only because I was on a steak cheese mission, but that will be next. It will have to wait a while 'cause I feel like a Boa that ate a small pig.
The place is hid out off McDonald Rd. , then south at Granite Reef, then it's just on the left by the Bashas'.
It's all about the meat, the bread, the folks!!! I'll stop now or you'll think I'm a shill.
Did I mention the chicken salad? Oooh yeah I did.... Enough"}
{"text":"Tasty Italian back East style deli. Has been here for over 40 years. I think I've been here a long long time ago but will definitely be coming back. The family-run business is run by the Two Sisters which take great care and pride in their food and work. Definitely there to suggest different items. Fresh food made to order at a reasonable price. Definitely will be coming back more and more. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Casella's for years and have never been disappointed. The whole family is kind and inviting and they always make me feel valued when I come in."}
{"text":"THE BEST sandwiches in all of Arizona. Only blocks from home, I've been known to walk here for a cheesesteak. Their homemade pizzelles are great. The people here treat you like family, whether you have been here once or twice or are a regular."}
{"text":"Let me start with me I love hot sandwiches and this place is the best so far I ever tried in my life had steak works for lunch amazingggggg!!!!! Thanks definitely be back again and again"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place. I had to check it out because my boss has been lunching here for the past 10+ years. I now understand why.  The sandwiches and homemade deli salads are delicious. I had a Salami and Provolone sandwich the French roll was fresh as can be and I ordered a small potato salad that was as good as it looks. I also added a homemade brined kosher pickle, it was different , but not in a bad way , actually really good .  I highly recommend stopping off here, support your local restaurants ! Casella's is now in my top 5."}
{"text":"I found this place courtesy of my fellow yelpers and was pleased to find the ratings were genuine. 

The owner, who was originally from Philadelphia, came to Scottsdale in 1974 and opened the deli in 1977.  Yeah, I am a nosy guy.

The hot pastrami sandwich was really exceptional.  I came back the next day to try the Italian Hoagie.  I looked inside the sandwich and found capicola. Yummy!  I took an extra sandwich to go, but it was soggy the next day.  So you need to eat the sandwich right there."}
{"text":"Update -all six reviews 5 starts. Amazing. How come more people do not know about this place?"}
{"text":"I go to Casella's once every week or two for their Italian Sub.  Best Italian sub in the Phoenxi/Scottsdale area.  Fresh components that taste great just amazing.  
The family that runs the place is great, warm, friendly, and gracious."}
{"text":"I live an hour west of Scottsdale. So whenever I'm in the area I hoots stop in.  Yummmm!  The chicken salad is the best,  and you won't be sorry if you order what \"pops\" says is an authentic philly.
