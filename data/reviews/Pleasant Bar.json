{"text":"Good specials and the dollar burger nights are great.  The front parking lot is a pain and the bar can get a little smokey, but it is an excellent neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"This place is for everyone. They allow smoking in the front, by the bar and also have a back dining section for non-smoking. $1 burger night is awesome. The parties are fresh and cooked just right, toppings are extra. The hot pepper cheese balls are excellent too! **Great homemade Ranch, for you ranch lovers out there like me! Drinks are always on point and good beer/drink specials. The staff is really nice. The place has definitely a hometown feel. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great Bartending and waitstaff----a local favorite of mine----

Could be a plus for some, they allow smoking......Dollar burgers are very good, overall pretty good bar food menu and mixed drinks are VERY STRONG"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great specials. Dollar burger night is pretty awesome. And service is great. My only complaint is the amount of smoke in the main bar area - it's enough to give you a headache. Luckily, the back room is available and isn't nearly as smoky. Still highly recommended."}
{"text":"The last time we came here I asked if they offer fresh cut fries and I was told that they do, it just isn't on the menu. We tried the fresh fries and they are amazing! That automatically gives them another star vs my original review. The burgers are still delicious, of course. And you can't beat the prices."}
{"text":"You can't complain about any place that chargers $1 for a burger!!! Came here with my brother nephew n mom because I did not believe him, I don't eat meat but I had to witness this fib. This is one of my stops on my road trip and it was kind of cool to sit in the dark watching everybody enjoy their burgers (the lights when because of the storm). You have to try this. 4 stars cause hey they should have a veggie version ;)"}
{"text":"Great burgers. They have dollar burger specials some nights. Toppings are extra. Despite being so cheap, burgers are great.  I only had the burgers. Despite how amazing they are. I can't rate a burger at five star. Don't know how you will beat fresh burgers at a dollar tho. 
I get 2-3 cheeseburgers with everything."}
{"text":"Awesome staff (KANDICE) first time in PA and had the pleasure of being waited on by Kandice. Attentive, sweet, amaze balls. From Seattle so expected to pay $$$ for the night and my jaw drop cheap but yummmmy.(drinks and food) if you are lucky to stop here when she's working I hope you ask for her to have the same amazing experience. Thank you for the memories."}
{"text":"The PBar just got better with the addition of two new air cleaners to reduce the amount of smoke in the air."}
{"text":"Always a great time.  Great service cold beer and good food.  Smoking allowed so be mindful, but if your looking for a great old school bar look no farther."}
{"text":"They have a food special everyday, I got the roast beef I enjoyed it,they cook it for eight hours and if you like gravy ask for extra ,I dident have enough to my liking, only thing I wish they had  mash potatoes ,I'm not a big fan of ff,it is smoking in front but go to the back ,oh the burgers were a dallor extra for sides but they looked very yummy :))"}
{"text":"I am a regular here. They have different specials every night. Love wings and burger night. Super friendly staff. You get that dive homely feeling here."}
{"text":"We originally were introduced to \"PBar\" from our neighbors when we bought our house. They told us this was the best burger they've ever had, so naturally we had to check things out. BOY were they right. We've spent every Thursday night here for the last year and have no signs of slowing down. Great good, great staff, the price is perfect and the atmosphere is always comfortable."}
{"text":"I love the P Bar. They have different specials every night. Waitresses are so nice. The food is awesome. I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"The burgers here are excellent. The atmosphere, not so much. The smoke is so thick, you can cut it with a knife. And most of the patrons are either long time drinkers, or kids just reaching legal drinking age, give or take a couple of years."}
{"text":"Great hidden Gem.  The Pleasant Bar on Old Clairton Road is easy to pass by.  The Bar is in a tiny strip mall with limited parking in front.  When you enter the bar is long and patrons who smoke are enjoying the drink, food and ability to puff.  At the rear of the bar room is an area that has plenty of seating in a smoke free environment.  It may be more open in the summer.  I was there on a cold night, but the radiant heaters overhead kept our table comfortable.  Monday and Thursdays the Pleasant Bar offers $1 burgers.  Yes, that is correct one dollar.  You are charged anywhere between $1 extra for bacon, 50 cents for cheese and other extras are 20 cents.  The burger is really tasty and though not huge quite filling.  The basket of fries is big.  Friday's offer fish sandwiches for a dollar also.  Our waitress was quite skilled in keeping all of our orders and bills straight.   Nothing fancy, just friendly, clean and good food at a good price.The Pleasant Bar lives up to its name."}
{"text":"I ended up here after a rough night of Lyft driving and I just wanted a drink before I went home to bed. Service was fine but I didn't know it was a smoking bar until I got inside. I had two drinks then decided to leave, since I'm not a fan of cigs and it got fairly smoky. I asked to cash out and the tab minimum was $10, which I didn't hit, so I took a drink chip despite that I likely wouldn't be back. Drinks are cheap!"}
