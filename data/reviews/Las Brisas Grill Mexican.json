{"text":"The food here is very authentic Mexican. I really like the chips and salsa at this place!

I have tried the tacos, enchiladas, rice, and beans, but my favorite dish is the Mexican Tortilla Chicken Soup. Sopa de Pollo is so amazingly good and is a very hearty portion (serves enough for two or leftovers). It's filled with breast of chicken, rice, and seasonings with a hint of lime juice. 

It's usually packed at lunch!"}
{"text":"Great food, and great prices!  This is the best AUTHENTIC Mexican food in the Lake Norman Area."}
{"text":"Las Brizas is one of the largest, most authentic Mexican restaurants in the lake area. It has been a long time since I have tasted salsa this authentic.
Whether or not it actually comes from a bottle or not, it doesn't taste like it does, which makes all the difference.

A little over a year ago, Las Brizas moved further up Statesville Rd., closer to Catawba Avenue, into a bigger building.

Although I haven't seen the parking lot packed, everyone I talk to has enjoyed the food. I've been told the margaritas are stout, and I have always enjoyed their quesadillas (I know, not the most adventurous Mexican dish, but whatever).  

Las Brizas is a great place to go with a group, if you're looking for good food that won't bleed your wallet dry, and cold beer/margaritas."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  I lived in Texas for many years and love Mexican food.  I would eat Taco Bell over this place.  That is how bad it is.  Not only that but the wait staff lies.  One lied about our service to the cashier when we tried to correct something at check out.  We tried to confront him about it and he lied to the cashier to cover his butt.  Either that or the cashier was covering for him.  I am not sure since I do not speak Spanish.  It was so horrible.  One of the worst experiences ever!!!!!"}
