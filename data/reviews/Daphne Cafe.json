{"text":"This is my second visit here, and it gets better. I ordered the grape leaves app, and Iskenderun kabap for main. Personally I think they make the best grape leaves in the city, better than Salam market's. The real surprise is the Iskender kabap. The gyro meat is tender and is perfected by the tomato sauce. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Greek food but seek more flavor. Service is good too. Come here on a sunny day for lunch, sit outside and you are in for a treat!"}
{"text":"I moved recently to Pittsburgh, and i'm a huge fan of The Iskander, i tried one the downtown and it wasn't good, i saw this restaurant in yelp and i thought i'll give it a try, the Iskander and the Kunafa is the BOMB!! You really should try them both, absolutely coming back"}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Daphne Cafe! Have been meaning to review it for a long time! Really fresh food, cute little place with a nice patio and sweet owners. Also BYOB which is a plus. Amazing hummus with hot pita bread. The soup is the most amazing thing I have ever had- I'm a little obsessed. We usually get the gyro salad, which has a ton of meat- soo good. Delicious dressing too. We also get a veggie-hummus wrap which is great too. Really can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Great food, but terrible service. Worth it if you don't mind maybe having to remind your server what you ordered."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  A lovely patio to dine on and BYOB!  You can get a great meal at a fair price, relax on the patio, and drink exactly what you want, which you paid exactly what you were willing.  Who wouldn't love this place?  Add that the family that owns and runs the place is warm and friendly and looks after you?  Come on!  Get down here!"}
{"text":"First time going here! the hummus and pita was fantastic! got falafel wrap for dinner which was overall was ok but the actual falafel was really good. and it was my first time trying turkish coffee and it was some of the bast coffee I've ever had."}
{"text":"One of our favorite family spots.  Great food and service.  Islander plate is our favorite.  Love that we can bring our own wine."}
{"text":"Daphne Cafe offers phenomenal and unique Turkish cuisine with small business charm.  My significant other and I have been going to the Daphne Cafe for over a year. We love the family who owns the restaurant and the delicious offerings.   The atmosphere in the dining room is slightly less than desirable as the noise level gets very loud even with just one noisy patron. The tile floors and sparse white decorations give a slightly cold, sterile, and uninviting vibe. In the summer, the patio can't be beat with the shrubs and umbrellas. You really feel cut off from the noise of Ellsworth Avenue and secluded in your own little Turkish getaway. Daphne is the perfect place to unwind. It is BYOB  The menu is large but I tend to stick with my favorites. The lentil soup is incredible and unique. The soup is blended and very smooth. The flavors are complex. Even during the hottest days of summer, I have a hard time resisting the lentil soup. The panini are always cooked to perfection and fresh. I prefer the Daphne panini, a combination of Turkish pepperoni and provolone cheese, and the tomato mozzarella panini with huge basil leaves. The salads are also fresh and delicious. I've also had great experiences with their appetizers. My personal favorite is the smyrna dip, yogurt and eggplant pureed together.   The only pitfall if you are in a hurry, is the service. The owners are friendly and wonderful, but very slow. I like to think that in their culture dining is a leisurely experience and they want to treat you to a great meal. But sometimes I feel forgotten, especially if we're waiting on change at the end of the meal. That definitely doesn't keep me away from Daphne since their takeout is fast and well prepared.   Keep an open mind and enjoy!"}
{"text":"How have I gone a year without knowing there is a delicous döner kebab for sale 10 minutes from my office?!   For those that are unaware, döner kebab is the Turkish equivalent of a Greek gyro (they bill them as gyros here, I think to alleviate confusion). Only it is not equivalent at all, but rather better in every way! The meat is less greasy, and more identifiably lamb (I had someone explain to me once that this is due to döner being halal and gyros, not so much... might be BS, or not). And the accompaniments are better: actual green lettuce, tomato chunks, thin slices of marinated red onions in lieu of giant hunks of raw white ones. And the Turkish yogurt sauce, cacik, while theoretically the same thing, is always somehow lighter and less sour-cream-like than Greek tzatziki.   Can't speak to the service, as I had take out, but that was quick. Waited 5 minutes and had a nice chat with the owner about my 3 months as a student in Berlin (where döner kebab is everywhere). Business seemed slow for a lunch hour, but this seemed to have no negative affect on the food I had, which was fresh, hot, and delicious.   Will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place more. I really do. It's cute, well-located, low-key, inexpensive, locally-owned, and has a patio for outdoor seating. The food is even pretty good. But this place is really awkward.  We showed up for a weeknight dinner around 7:30, and there was no one seated inside, and only one large group outside. Awkward. In order to seat three, the owner had to move two tables together. Also awkward. He helped us very kindly and promptly, but he was smoking in the outdoor seating area, which was not a smoking section (I don't think, since the only ash tray there was his). Again, awkward.  So we sat and received some really awkward menus from a sweet but awkward waitress. The font is difficult to read (is that an L or a D?), the food descriptions lack consistency (is that salad on a bed of lettuce or just the other salads?), and the items on the menu are not clearly distinguished from one another (what's the difference between the gyro wrap and the gyro sandwich?).  We opened our BYO wine and things got less awkward for a while, until they brought our main dishes before we finished our appetizer. There was not enough room on the table for all that food, and even when we did finish, our table was not cleared promptly.  That said, the people who work there were very nice and accommodating, and the food wasn't bad (it also wasn't fantastic). If they re-write and re-print their menu, and smooth out their seating arrangements and timing on appetizers, this place will be just fine. I would recommend it for a quick lunch or super-casual dinner, but after this experience at Daphne, it's not a place I want to linger at through a whole bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonable prices. Byob always a must for my family. The owner came to our table and was very hospitable going above our expectations.   I had the lamb kabob that was tender and seasoned with a turkish style. The rice pudding was almost as good as my yiayas.   Go there !"}
{"text":"Went back here recently (a few years later) and still love it! Beautiful, clean indoor and outdoor spaces and prompt service. Food is delicious--love the beverages, appetizers (try the Mediterranean Dip!), toasty bread, and platters. Took one star off only because falafel was too dry and not fully to my liking. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Hold on to your receipt!   I was surprised to see my credit card charged for more than double the amount that I paid for lunch for me and a friend at this location this weekend.  I called my credit card company who verified that while the authorized amount was for $23 and after a 20% tip totalled $28 I was somehow ultimately charged $64.  My cc company encouraged me to speak with the restaurant to see if I could resolve the matter with them first.    I first called the restaurant and spoke with the woman who had served me (owner?) and was told to come in so that they could resolve the matter.  I was told that \"we usually don't make mistakes but they happen\".  When I went in the same woman insisted that they did not charge $64 to any one that day, but they did not appear to have my receipt in the 10-15 receipts from that day that she brought to the counter to review in front of me.  When I asked if we or she could review the receipts more slowly to determine if my receipt from that day was even in the pile, she became more agitated and emphatically exclaimed \"Why don't you believe me?  It was only me and my daughter here that day!\".  While I would love to be able to afford to give a $40 tip, I can't.  I assured her that I wanted to figure out what happened and I was not accusing her of anything.  While I can understand that one might be defensive at being informed that a wrong amount was charged by their restaurant to a credit card company, this person offered no ideas on how to resolve the issue and did not appear to want to get to the bottom of this.    Uncomfortable with the interaction, I left to talk to my credit card company to initiate a dispute. This was a frustrating experience especially after a long day of work and I am disappointed to say the least by how this was handled by the business.  We can all lose our cool at times but looking back and realizing that my friend and I had also been upcharged for fries that we hadn't even ordered or asked about, I am feeling suspicious of this business' integrity.  Unless some extraordinary explanation comes through from this investigation, I am reporting this location to the Better Business Bureau.  In the meantime, I have submitted a copy of my receipt to my cc company and am waiting to hear back."}
{"text":"The food was the best out of the few Mediterranean places I've tried in Pittsburgh. The Ezme appetizer is very good and fresh tasting. I had the Lamb Adana for an entree and it was seasoned to perfection, not too salty, and not overcooked. The pistachio baklava, which I had for dessert, is also very good.   Service was decent, and friendly.   I would recommend this place and will be coming back."}
{"text":"My little brother and I checked it out... Nice place to sit on the patio and drink some Turkish coffee (ugh so good). I'm a vegetarian so I got the falafel wrap which I give a 3.5... I have had yummier falafel elsewhere, but the gyro my brother got smelled awesome and he loved it. I sense that the lamb here is its main selling point. The atmosphere was very sweet, seems very family owned and operated."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. My husband and I are \"regulars,\" and so we asked if they could cater our rehearsal dinner the night before our wedding. The event was incredible. We held the party in their party room downstairs in the basement, which is gorgeous. It is decorated beautifully and has seating around the perimeter of the room, allowing for mingling and lots of conversation. The food was (as always) also fantastic - I would highly recommend the Iskendar! The couple that owns the restaurant are lovely and so friendly... they did not just cater, they HOSTED the event. They were downstairs with us, encouraging us to have a good time and generally making sure everything was as we wanted it. We felt like part of the family! All our friends and relatives have commented on how delicious the food was, and how unique and special the evening was. I would highly recommend Daphne's if you want to hold a special event, or just for a casual evening dinner. We certainly love it and will continue to go back often!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, nice, cozy, and inviting! It is a family business and we met with the owners who are a sweet couple from Turkey! They serve authentic and high- quality food. We were a group of four and we decided to have a table outdoor which was really nice. We enjoyed our food so much and we are definitely coming back for all heavenly grilled meat and kabobs!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food from Daphne's! I only ever get takeout (as I live only a block away) so I can't speak to the service, but the food is just so fresh and delicious. My boyfriend always gets the Doner Kebab and is always very full afterwards. I tend to get the Daphne Mixed Veggie and oh my goodness the hummus is the smoothest, richest hummus I think I've ever had. I absolutely love it. The cacik is also great and everything else that is included is fantastic.   The only two drawbacks I have are the falafel does tend to be on the dry side, so I end up having to pay for an extra side of sauce (usually cacik) to make up for it. This goes for when I order the falafel wrap or salad as well. The second more of a heads up: if you order take out, make sure to check your order before you leave. Three times I have gotten home and assumed that the extra sauce or pita was packed in the individual entree containers to find that it wasn't there. I love the cacik so much that I've walked back and they've given it to me, no problem. And it's also my fault that I haven't learned by now to check. So I just want to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else who lives further away. :)   Overall, really great food for a decently reasonable price."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden gem in Shadyside. We arrived around 8pm for dinner and sat on their patio-which is perfect for warm weather dining. The service is very prompt and attentive. We started out with the Mediterranean dip with warm pita. It was a great mix of flavors, however you must like tomatoes as the main ingredient is tomato paste. We ordered the doner platter to share and it came with a large amount of shaved lamb, rice, cacik along with grilled tomatoes and peppers. The ingredients were all very fresh and tasty. Make sure to order turkish coffee at the end of your meal along with some baklava! Also, they are byob if you are in the mood to bring along some wine."}
{"text":"This is a great BYO spot with outdoor seating on Ellsworth. The menu isn't very extensive, but what they do have is very good and the prices are perfect. Their lamb for the gyros and gyro salads is very flavorful, and they give you a lot. The service was a little slow, but it was nice to not be interrupted constantly while eating. It was a very relaxing meal and I will absolutely be going back. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish there were just a few more apps and/or entrees to choose from. It is definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food, huge salads and tasty hummus.  Really nice atmosphere with a large outdoor patio area. The aryan yogurt drink was really refreshing."}
{"text":"Really good, cheap Mediterranean food. After a lot of searching, and a lot of disappointing meals, I was so happy to finally find this in Pittsburgh! Don't let the unassuming atmosphere fool you - the food is great. I especially liked the chicken kebabs, which were incredibly moist. And you get a ton of food for the price! BYOB."}
{"text":"Ate there last night.  Not many people, probably due to the bad weather.  However, the food was excellent!  Everything I could have asked for.  The food was served in generous portions, and tasted great.  I felt that I was back visiting Turkey.  Daphne is a family run operation, not some chain.  You could tell that there was pride in every plate served.  The owner asked if he could pull up a chair to talk after we finished eating.  He joined us for a bit of very enjoyable conversation.  THAT'S what makes an establishment like this stand out and be special!"}
{"text":"Great gyros (both sandwiches and wraps).  Meat tastes a bit leaner and healthier than most gyro spots.  Hummus is pretty good.   Baklava is just okay."}
{"text":"Very authentic, and has a homely feel to the place. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have been here two or three times. While the food is okay and good, I find it to be bland and dry sometimes. Given that there are a lot of other Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food close by, it is hard to come back here. But still, the food is decent. I do not like that there is no single veggie that accompanies the food. Usually in all the middle easter restaurants I have been to, when you order an entree (kabob dish, etc.) there are a few veggies for the crunchiness and as a refreshment. But in Daphne, the dish comes without anything, not even a single pickle. So, it is hard to eat, it feels very dry."}
{"text":"If you looking for a delicious Mediterranean food don't go further. Family own restaurant and friendly people. We enjoyed it a lot..."}
{"text":"A true gem of a restaurant; great family run place by a Turkish family that serves up some authentic, delicious dishes.  After returning to Pittsburgh from some time abroad in Istanbul, I was pleasantly surprised to find a place that served such excellent Turkish food in a warm, welcoming atmosphere.  The cacik and kisir were two favorites at our table.  The owner himself stopped over to welcome us, and after hearing we'd been to Istanbul and had the baklava there, he was generous enough to give our table some of their baklava to try.  (It was outstanding, high quality pistachio baklava - highly recommended!).  Thanks for a great dinner, Daphne Cafe - we'll be returning!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Good food. Quick service. Reasonable prices. Order the appetizer trio for 10$. Food quality has deteriorated over last couple of years but it's a good quick place to bring a date. This place is BYOB and it's about $5 for bottle fees so don't bring one big bottle or you will be ripped off."}
{"text":"Five stars because they deliver on what you should expect. I eat here often. Very good value to cost. All ingredients are fresh and the food has good taste and flavor. I usually get the gyro platter. Gyro meat is cooked right and is of good quality and always fresh salad and sides come with it.  The appetizers are very good as well. We'll made and tasty. Price is very reasonable and it is truly a family operation. The folks are very friendly and they give off that file vibe which is nice. Decor is simple but we'll done and neat.  When you are looking for a good place to eat lunch or dinner and want good food and relaxed time to hangout this is the place to go. Won't hurt your pocket either."}
{"text":"Zero stars for this place, I had to put one because it doesn't work that way. They have no professionalism or manners. Their customer service was so bad, we didn't even stay to finish the food. We got boxes, packed up the food, paid the bill and immediately left in protest.   Firstly my friends were embarrassed by the manager who rudely interrupted them in the middle of their prayer (they are muslim). After ordering food, my friends had specially moved out side on to the dark and wet patio for the prayer(it was after sundown, it had just rained and no one was there) to make sure that the guests inside would not be disturbed, I saw the manager take a look at them and then walk into the kitchen. A few seconds later he and another female employee interrupted my friends in the middle of the prayer and forced them to go inside saying:   \" You cannot pray out side, this is not your country, this is America\".   The people on the table next to us started staring and we sat there in silence after getting publicly embarrassed, thinking how it would be completely pointless to rationally argue with this person who obviously had no concept of freedom of religion, expression or speech.  If that wasn't enough already, the waitress was super rude to us as well.  The waitress clumsily dropped the top bread of my kofte' burger on the table in front of everyone, put the rest of the burger in front of me, didn't even stop to apologize in courtesy or pick up the bread and just walked away. I was completely stunned at this non-professional attitude and downright rudeness. I called the waitress back and she casually asked: \"what do you want?\" and I asked for a replacement on the burger, to that she said:\"I will bring you another top part of the bread\" and then walked away.   We immediately asked for boxes when she came back with the top bread. They gave us boxes after making us wait for another ten minutes, we paid the bill and we quickly left."}
{"text":"A pleasure place lets you enjoy a cozy night. The food is delicious, the people are sweet, the yard is fancy at night."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and haven't had a bad meal. Most times I get the gyro. It is big and tasty and when I find something that I like I tend to stick with it. The hummus is fresh and the grape leaves were really good. I would certainly stop in for a meal here if you are in the neighborhood. The outdoor patio is quiet and tranquil. I will continue to come back and try new things b"}
{"text":"I love this place and I always forget about it.  It's such an adorable spot with great hummus/tabbouleh and a sinful gyro platter.  The best part about it is the outdoor patio, it's simply adorned with those soft glowy light bulbs on a string and a bunch of potted plants.  A wonderful place to sit with a magnum bottle of BYOB wine and watch Ellsworth go by.  The food is flavorful and inexpensive, and the family who runs it is very sweet.  I wouldn't necessarily say it was destination dining, but I think anyone who lives in the area would be hard pressed to find a better casual spot to become a regular."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! They offer BYOB and have both indoor and outdoor seating. Inside is decorated very cool. Their menu has everything you could want in terms of Mediterranean food. I've had their sandwiches and salads - very delicious. Their hummus platter is also very good for an appetizer.  The owners and staff are very sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"Hummus to die for! I like this place. The food is always good. Recently ordered the hummus appetizer which turned out to be the best I've ever eaten. Try it yourself and see if you agree."}
{"text":"It'll be one of my most favorite ones here in Pittsburgh.  My recommendation:  Turkish coffee+Eggplant+Döner (Gyro) Kebab+Künefe Enjoy?(°°)?"}
{"text":"I really  enjoyed the Daphne cafe in Shadyside. Their hummus is delicious! I ordered the veggie wrap with tomatoes, onions, olives, lettuce, hummus  and feta cheese..it was so good! The portions are big! It's a very cute atmosphere. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it's kinda a small, tight place! It's different, the owner's are nice...the waitress wasn't the friendliest, it took awhile to receive some of the things we asked for, but that was understandable! They had two parties of about 12-15 people each in the main dining area, we asked the waitress if it was a normal Sunday for them or busier than usual. She said it was busier than normal. The prices are so reasonable and cheap..especially for the quality, delicious food that they serve! Not only do they have middle Eastern/Turkish food, they have some american options for a picky eater or someone who is just isn't in the mood for middle Eastern food! Definitely will be returning to Daphne's cafe!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot to spot in and grab dinner!!! They have a great menu with many tantalizing options! I had the falafel appetizer and really enjoyed how crispy the outer layer was while the inside had such great flavor! I also had the gyro sandwich and fries! The sandwich was very large with a generous portion of meat! I enjoyed my meal and cannot wait to go back and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Overpriced  Unprofessional  I would rather go to high end restaurant for their price.  Owners are awkward they stare you while you eat."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place and loved it. We brought our dog and ate at a table on the sidewalk. We had the platter so we could get a little taste of everything and it was delicious. Lamb is one of my favorites and they know what they're doing with it here.  We came in on a Friday night? Maybe? And it was still early so not crowded at all. There were three women working and we didn't feel ignored or under-served once. So perhaps they've finally worked out the kinks in service?  Either way, this place is really affordable and tasty. I'll definitely be back for a gyro!"}
{"text":"Great place and service. We went while they were hosting a wedding party outside, so the staff had their work cut out for them. We waited a little, but our waitress made sure to take care of us when she could.   I got the doner salad which was a decent size. The lamb was well-seasoned and the vegetables were fresh.   Try the aryan if you're feeling adventurous. It's a salty yogurt drink. They make it fresh, which is far better than the bottled version at the local middle eastern stores.   I wouldn't recommend this place for date night unless you get outdoor seating. The inside is a bit sparse and casual. Outside would be great. The bride and groom clearly thought so."}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best,  with one girl working the whole place,  but the food was very reasonable for the price.  The Turkish coffee was alright,  definitely not the best that I've had,  but the Gyro wrap was big and tasty, though I asked for a side of the sauce since it was a bit dry.  I'd definitely give this place another shot,  it's right off the main strip in Shadyside,  and it seems like a great takeout option with lots of veg friendly options. I'll return."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I can eat that eggplant with yogurt and garlic dip all day long. Also, best pita served I have ever had! Great platters, especially the lamb, so juicy and tasty! Love it!"}
{"text":"AMAZING restaurant!  I went once and I fell in love!  The taste of food is really Turkish ! Owner and his family who worked there is so nice . Service is on high level! Highly recommended! Gonna come back 100000 times for sure !"}
{"text":"Great food Friendly staff  We go to Danphen cafe often. Appetizers are the best.  Service can be slow when busy night,"}
{"text":"Their desserts are to die for and their lamb is absolutely a must! Always excellent service, always leave pleased."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a snowy Sunday.  It's BYOB and there's a great 6 pack shop up the street.  We got the Döner (gyro) Sandwich with a side of fries.  The sandwich was great, fresh ingredients and a good cucumber sauce.  Definitely a good spot for Turkish and Greek food in the city!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have eaten at this restaurant at least 2x/month for the past two years. It's a family owned byob restaurant with authentic Turkish food. Not only is the food great, but the owners are amazing hosts and, being a byob, the check is always very easy on the wallet.   They have a cute patio/outdoor seating area which is always nice for people-watching on Ellsworth. You can also order take-out which we typically do during the week.   If you haven't tried out this gem yet, stop by for lunch or dinner - this is the type of place you want to see do well here in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"I discovered this cafe with some co-workers during lunch in the early Fall. It's a great, little hidden gem of a diner. It's pretty simple inside but the food is pretty great! It's a nice spot for a lunch or dinner date with a casual vibe. It's also a nice break from the more expensive options along Ellsworth."}
{"text":"The food was SO good that it made up for the street construction, to include loud workers, back hoes and jack hammers!"}
{"text":"Yum and BYOB!  Stopped by on a whim while searching for a quick lunch venue.  Never heard of it but glad I found it!  Great dill-yogurt- dip (forget what it's called) and delicious eggplant salad.  Plenty of pita brought by a pleasant, cute, waiter with a great voice;)!  My friend and I split a salad and three appetizer sampler and got out for about 13 bucks!  Next time we are bringing a bottle of wine and heartier appetites!"}
{"text":"Came here and got the babaganoush (AMAZING. Their pita is also fantastic: warm, and slightly chewy). Also got the Turkish Doner (Gyro) plate with rice. It came with a cool and refreshing cucumber yogurt that balanced out the rougher texture and savory flavor of the lamb. Be aware though that the plate ONLY comes with meat and rice. That's it. So if you're looking for some veggies, you'll have to order that separately."}
{"text":"Cute little lunch spot on Ellsworth. Nice patio. Amazing roasted red pepper feta dip! Warm pitas, gyro salad, need I say more? If you enjoy Turkish cuisine, you're in for a treat. A welcome addition to the Ellsworth area."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff.Horrible place.Went for a dinner with friends and tried to say our prayers after food in the patio but was cut off in the middle of the prayer and told you're not allowed to pray in the restaurant. This is America. This is not your country. You cannot pray everywhere. Well for your kind information This is the United Stated of America that preaches freedom of speech and expression. Why open up a place that serves Halal food for Muslims in the first place if you think its not a country for Muslims. The staff was extremely ill-mannered. I would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice now and have loved it. The owners of the restaurant are really nice and will come and chat with you if you sit down.  In terms of appetizers, I'd recommend getting the appetizer sampler because it gives you a small taste of everything on the menu. The pita they give with the sampler is warm and you can always ask for more which is a plus.  In terms of main dish they have a variety of kebabs (which is more authentically Turkish than some of the paninis)  which are delicious. If you're a fan of spicier meat I'd recommend the Adana kebab but their other kebabs are equally tasty.  I wouldn't recommend getting dessert, it isn't homemade, the baklava they served us wasn't very moist."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I'm never really impressed. Underwhelmed by my experience today as well. After being seated it took longer than it should've to be greeted or addressed. The only words the waitress uttered the entire time was \"are you ready to order?\"..couldn't get her to crack a smile.   Sat outside on the deck, covered by umbrellas so it was nice and not too hot. Ordered an Adana wrap which was good but nothing special...the use of a tortilla to wrap it took away from flavor and authenticity. I just feel like there are so many great Turkish restaurant in Pittsburgh that it's not worth it to come here for a sub-par experience."}
{"text":"First time coming here. We had reservations for a Friday night to celebrate a birthday dinner. They accommodated us in the small dining room. The place was packed when we arrived and loud. It was a nice atmosphere! The service was a little slow. The food was great, loved the gyro. Byob so we brought beers, wines, and more! Easy place to find and there is a lot across the street to park for $5! The food is priced nicely, for 9 people it only came to $152!"}
{"text":"what a nice find!  dropped in for a quick bite so we shared 4 appetizers.  for the $ incredibly generous, fresh, tasty.  bulgur salad had plenty of fresh parsley.  baba ganoush was smokey and delicious.  enjoyed stuffed grape leaves: very flavorful and fresh.  pita was plentiful and warm.  would love to come back for more!  and our servers were super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed that I haven't tried this dinner spot until now. The lack of people inside the restaurant while walking by has always been a deterrent. However, I went in to take-out dinner tonight and was more than pleased with the food. I got the gyro salad, which is well worth $9 due to the amount of meat that they put on the dish. I also tried the mediterranean dip, which is a mix of roasted red peppers, feta cheese and olive oil. After sharing with two people, we still have leftovers for tomorrow's lunch. I also brought home the rice pudding, which is house made and has a sprinkle of cinnamon on top. I'm a sucker for rice pudding so this was absolutely delicious. After talking with the owner while getting my take-out, my boyfriend happened to mention that he loves baklava, so the owner gave us a taste of the baklava to bring home, free of charge. His generosity was a reflection of good business, and the baklava did not disappoint. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Very good food. Everything feels like it is homemade and the service is very good as well. Prices are reasonable. Brimg your own drinks of you want to drink."}
{"text":"I went here with my friends and looking forward to some authentic Turkish food from all the raving reviews however it was definitely not authentic.   We ordered their iskendar kebob, chicken kebab and kofte. their iskendar meat was bland, dry and in a pool of ketchup sauce. their so called kofte is meatball texture, very chewy and definitely not sirloin steak as their menu states. it came with fries which I did not fancy so we had a side salad with it. Very mediocre food and definitely could be better.   it's byob but there's a $5 cork fee so I'd bring my own cork to save some money. Turkish coffee however is weak and appetizers are your norm you get anywhere u go which was tolerable.   Service is okay and the atmosphere is more like a cafeteria. not coming here and not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food is very very good. Everything I've tried from Gyro to veggie dishes has been (at least) very good. The daughter (I'm guessing she's the daughter) is not too friendly - kind of like \"I don't really want to be here doing this\". But everything gets done, and the food is what brings you back! When we first came here we met several others whom we knew, and they told us they come here all of the time - a great sign. I'd say this is one of my top 3 Mediterranean food restaurants in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and tasty. It's a small local biz. Great for a healthy and filing lunch."}
{"text":"It was so cute! The deck outside and whole atmosphere. The service was wonderful and the food was amazing! I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been one of my favorites for some time.  Everything I've tried has been great, and the staff (who appear to be mainly a family) are incredibly friendly.  The pita bread is homemade, and it's so good that I've ordered it on its own to serve at a party.  The eggplant dishes (there are several) are especially wonderful, and the lentil soup is a very favorable thin brothy soup with a great flavor.  The lamb dishes are especially delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday night a few weeks ago to have a cute date night BYOB dinner on an outside patio for the first time.  It is small inside, cozy and quaint.  The outside patio is nice and there were couples and larger parties enjoying each other right on Ellsworth.  We split the Kisir as an appetizer - it was a grain type spread and served with pita bread.  It was prepared with the perfect amount and combination of spices.  A very different flavor than I was expecting, but still very good.  Their pita bread was warm and fluffy and perfect!  I ordered the Aegean salad and it had a very nice house dressing on it.  Bobby got their savory pocket and while he didn't love it; he didn't hate it either.  I had a bite - it was good, but I probably would have tried something else!  We split their baklava...incredible. Literally, mouthwatering.    The service was very friendly -  wouldn't mind going back just because I feel healthy when I am eating Mediterranean food and it was a nice, quaint little atmosphere for a date before stepping out for some drinks."}
{"text":"Vegetarian friendly, family owned, attentive staff and great food!    Why should vegetarians be limited to one or two things on a menu?  Daphne gives them real choices.  Everything tastes fresh and authentic.  Portions are generous.  There's a relaxing space to eat on the patio,which is ideal if you have kids or pets.   There are some unusual dishes on the menu, but also some familiar foods that Daphne makes really well. The Babaghanoush and Falafel are the best I've found.  I recommend the Mixed Appetizer, which allows you to sample 3 choices. Try something new, order the Ezme!  I was interested in some of the artwork, and our server answered all of my questions.  One painting reproduction was of \"The Tortoise Trainer,\" a satirical comment on the Ottoman government at the turn of the century (1907). The painter, Osman Hamdi Bey, was an intellectual, archaeologist, and a statesman.  We had a great meal and conversation at Daphne Cafe, there are so many wonderful reasons to dine there."}
{"text":"Decent little Mediterranean spot nestled in a cozy Shadyside location.   It's funny I've had better experiences Uber eats'ing from here then dining there! I once dined there and I love the outdoor patio area which is cute and charming. Service was great and personable ! Seems family owned and you can feel the love  I always get the same thing, the mixed grill with bulgar wheat and turkish cacik sauce (essentially like tzaziki). The sauce is well made and refreshing!   I don't know what it was but the meat just tasted better when I ordered it on uber eats! When I got it there it just felt dry. You would think otherwise ! But overall the food is good, can't go wrong with it. Kind of on the same level of pricing as most mediterranean restaurants in the area.    Not bad! Would order again!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for takeout in Shadyside. The walk-in service is quite good; prompt, cordial, and they even let you sit at a table while you wait. I definitely prefer getting something to go here than eating in, because the staffing here is minimal and usually just has one young lady working both the indoor and outdoor seating. If you eat in, it won't necessarily be very efficient. (The staff has always been quite nice, just not quick.)  For food, any of the gyro dishes are delicious - particularly the gyro salad, which is simple but very filling and has a tasty, garlicky dressing that isn't too heavy. The hummus with pita is good too, but I'd most recommend a side of their French fries, which are crisp yet meaty and have a jealousy-inducing aroma. Luckily, you get a ton of them for your couple bucks, so it's not a big loss to share with a friend.  I'd recommend this place any day of the week...except Monday, seeing as they're closed."}
{"text":"I like to go to this place for lunch. They have a nice outdoor space as well. The restaurant is pretty clean and spacious. Prices are all right. Taste is pretty good as well. I don't recommend getting a chicken wrap, because the tortilla wrap is too thin. I wish they used actual pita instead of a tortilla wrap. I've had chicken with the rice as well. It is good, but they don't give any sauces with it. That would be the suggestion I have for them: garlic, tahini sauce or something with meal"}
{"text":"Greattttttt humus for a starter and awesome portions for the price. Went on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch it was perfect. Staff was really friendly and the lamb gyro was really good.  I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice people and great turkish cuisine ,Everything fresh We live in Morgantown WV, thats the only great Turkish food place i don't mind to come every day and eat there ,don't miss this place and great people."}
{"text":"best Mediterranean food for price/quality. lamb rack and doner were great"}
{"text":"Daphne Cafe is another restaurant I always forget about until I walk past it on Ellsworth - and this place is worth remembering bc they've got lots of outdoor seating which is at a premium in Shadyside in the summer!  The first few times I came here the food was good but the service was kind of meh.  The food has improved, and so has the service!  I think they just needed to work the kinks out.  Let me tell you something:  there's little I wont do for hummus, and they've got great hummus here.  Everything tastes fresh and is inexpensive.  It's not a fancy restaurant, but its a nice restaurant and the past two times I've been here everything has been great.    If you havent tried this restaurant I suggest you do so now, bc its been increasingly crowded with each return, I think word is getting out."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a million times, and finally decided to try it out. Outdoor patio seating? Yes! BYOB? Awesome! Good food and attentive service - yup! I was with a group of meat eaters and vegetarians, and everybody liked what they ordered. Solid, tasty Mediterranean food. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great little family owned resturant. Food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. Love that they have outside seating as well."}
{"text":"Despite going to the chiropractor practically across the street from Daphne Cafe, I have never even noticed this place.  So when a friend recommended coming here, I was surprised to discover this cute little cafe.  They have outdoor and indoor seating, but the outdoor seating was really cute!  On a lovely summer day, this was such a great atmosphere to have a business lunch.  I enjoyed the Baba Ganoush and falafel very much for lunch.  They provide you with plenty of pita to enjoy with your meal.  The Baba Ganoush was a very generous portion, and I actually took quite a bit home with me.  The falafel was probably the best falafel I have had in Pittsburgh.   While I didn't pay for the meal so I don't remember the exact prices, they seemed fairly reasonable at the time.  We had pretty good service throughout the meal so I think that issue has been resolved!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic here, the owners are so friendly, definitely recommend this place. The only thing is they need to hire more waiters for busy hours, so expect some delay if you go there in busy hours but it is worth it."}
{"text":"My review may be biased high, because I love middle eastern cuisine. Not only did I grow up on it, but it is always super veg-friendly!  Anyway, I stopped in for dinner last week on a weeknight. As could be predicted, it wasn't very busy so we had the full attention of the staff. I ordered the red lentil soup and the Daphne mixed veg platter.  The lentil soup was smooth overall, but I periodically picked up a small amount of crunch that felt like a mistake. Probably won't order that again.  However, the main dish came out pretty much perfect. The grape leaves and hummus especially were good, so if you're looking to order appetizers, I would strongly recommend those.  Overall very happy, will return"}
{"text":"Daphne's is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh! Outdoor seating, quality Gyros, and a selection of dips and desserts, what more can you ask for? BYOB you say? SOLD! Will always come back when I visit"}
{"text":"They have the best pita breads, hands down. Do not miss the hummus appetizer with the pita bread.   I tried the iskander kebab entrée, which was really good. The kebabs are served on a bed of pita, which actually makes the bread a little soggy, but tastes marvellous nevertheless."}
{"text":"This place is a great option in Shadyside! My fiancé loves Gyros and she always insists that I take her into Southside and go to Lesvos. This can be a real pain on a weekend night with all of the madness down there so I was determined to find an option closer to home. We can actually walk to Daphne Cafe and i'm really glad we found it. The first time we went, there were only a couple other people in there and we were immediately sat and our food came out quickly and was delicious. The prices you just can't beat in Shadyside and you can get a full dinner for two for around 20 bucks including an appetizer. The second time we went, we got take out and it was just as good. Friendly and courteous just as if we were sitting down. I'm very pleased to have found this place and my fiancé is more than satisfied having a gyro so close to home! We will definitely be going back more and more!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Daphne Cafe early this winter for a falafel wrap. I thought the falafel itself was pretty right on - nice crispy exterior with warm soft center and decent flavor. But the wrap was a white tortilla from Sysco (the tortillas were in the display case behind the counter, that's how I know! Tacky!) which I thought was gross and weird. I mean even Sysco sells pita, which would have been a slight improvement. My next pet peeve about this falafel is that there were no cucumbers on it. My next pet peeve is that there were pale-totally-unripe-flavorless tomatoes on it. Sorry, I just hate pale tomatoes; if they are not in season or ripe, please spare me. The lettuce was iceberg, not the biggest deal. It had tahini on it, so that was right.   I don't think I will go back to see if they use higher quality ingredients in other menu items."}
{"text":"I wanted to visit this one since a few weeks and finally I tried it. The ambiance is average, the server was good. Food was very good and delicious. I had the chicken wrap and red lentil soup and I was very impressed with the quantity. I also ordered an appetizer - Cacik which is basically a dip made of mint,yogurt etc. with pita bread and that was delicious too. The pita bread was freshly made and tasted yummy. Would visit again! But it is a little on the higher side in terms of pricing."}
{"text":"Small restaurant on Ellsworth.  Great to sit outside in good weather, BYOB.  The menu is a little quirky but one will find familiar turkish/middle eastern items on the menu.  I have tried all the eggplant dishes on the menu and they are decent.  A little on the pricy side for the quality of food, seating and service."}
{"text":"No, no, no, no, and no! This place has the consistency of a monkey on a seesaw. I've been here more times than I'd care to admit...sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible, sometimes it's just OK. I can't figure it out. This is just another example of what happens when mediocre food lands in an unbelievable location. The lentil soup is the only thing I could recommend....but honestly, it's not worth the trip."}
{"text":"I just did brunch at Daphne Café with a few friends, and we were very pleased with it.  For starters, we ordered an appetizer sampler, in which we got their mild, but delectable hummus, their mediterranean dip, and their ezme salad.  All three were gone quickly enough, and the mediterranean dip was full of flavor in all the best ways.  The appetizers in general were wondrous.  For an entrée, I ordered a gyro platter, or something of the sort: I can't remember the exact name.  It was also pretty good, but in contrast to the appetizers and the desserts, the consensus around the table was that the entrées were something this fledgling business might still be working on a bit.  It was tasty, but could have used some work in presentation and perceived quality.  For dessert, we split a pistachio roll, and this alone sold us on the place: It was perfectly portioned to be split among three or four people, and the flavor was both unlike anything we had had before, and impossible to criticize.    Another perk of the place is the Turkish tea, which is mild, slightly sweet, and of a decent quality as teas go.  This is a place I would recommend (they're new, and it would be excellent to see more people going there!) and it is a place to which all three of us will return."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Not a bad place at all, just not as good as some other Turkish options."}
{"text":"While there was basically nothing wrong with the food or the service, it also wasn't a standout. Came here for lunch with a couple of people and there were only a handful of people eating. The service was quick and friendly and the food came out pretty quickly as well. I ordered the babaganoush and have to say that I definitely had better ones, the pita bread however was delicious, fresh and light. We also ordered the falafel and grape leaves as entrees. My favorite were the falafel, but then again I wasn't the biggest fan of the tahini sauce that came with it. As someone else mentioned, the water glasses were never re-filled and the music in the background was so loud that it was a bit disturbing. For my main I had a simple chicken kebab with rice and I really liked it. The meat was tender and the flavors really nice. The price is quite decent for the portions you get. All the food was fresh and made with good ingredients. If you're craving Mediterranean food for a decent price, I would definitely recommend Daphne Cafe, although I am sure there are better options in the Burgh."}
{"text":"We ate here tonight for a casual date night.  The food here is amazing!! We started with the Cacik appetizer, which was soo good! By far one of the best Mediterranean spreads I've had.  And don't even get me started on their pita- it was fresh, warm, and delicious! For my entree, I ordered the chicken kabob, which was really great (especially because this can be a pretty basic dish)- but the chicken was marinated deliciously and the rice was great!  Decent portions, too.  My partner had the Doner (gyro) panini, which looked amazing (and he said it was pretty awesome!)  It was a huge sandwhich- he is a guy who can typically eat a LOT- and he was full upon finishing the panini!  We will definitely be returning; may become a regular for us!  The atmosphere was a little on the plain side; but you can tell when you enter that it is truly authentic food, so we didn't mind the simple atmosphere at all!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants in Pittsburgh and so far Daphne Cafe is the best. Their kabobs are extremely tender, salad dressing and salad are refreshing, and their hummus is spot on. Everything was simple, but delicious and well executed. I will be returning."}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh and sort of stumbled on Daphne Cafe while looking for a nice casual dinner. It's a small place, family-run and friendly, with a rewarding and interesting menu.  I've eaten at many Turkish restaurants through the years, in different US cities, and while they vary from place to place they tend to have a pretty standard menu - meaning what you might eat in Istanbul. But Daphne Cafe has a more unusual, though equally delicious menu--featuring food in the style of the city of Ismir.  It was a pleasure to try several new things, and everything we had was honestly terrific - good portions, but also very flavorful and freshly prepared. The owner was really friendly, and came by to chat after we had finished dinner (and pointed out a special dessert to try as well).  The service is a bit slow and sometimes distracted (meaning you have to get the attention of someone, who may be back stocking shelves, as it's a place where everyone does everything). But well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great and quick service. Really liked the options on the menu. Lots of food for a decent price."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little place in Shadyside.  This is Turkish food that is super fresh, very homemade and all around excellent.  Beyond that, the couple who owns Daphne Cafe could not be more sweet.  Take the time to get to know them and you'll realize it's not just the food that keeps people coming back."}
{"text":"I've had lunch takeout a few times and everything is good so far! It's cooked to order (except for refrigerated desserts) so call ahead if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Loved the ezme , kisir, and smyrna. Everything's fresh , expertly prepared, and delicious. Bilge was a wonderful server. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you want a authentic, family owned, amazing Turkish food this is your place to go! Not only was the food delicious but the owner was so excited to share his food with us!  The food was so fresh and so delicious! We rented the dining area downstairs for a party of 20+. It was decorated beautifully and had these cool couches to sit on. We started off with the appetizer which was a salad, tabouli, a sauteed eggplant dish which was my favorite, a sour cream dip with crunchy nuts,  cous cous, and pita. That was followed by a sauteed steak with sour cream. Next was my the main dish of grilled lamb, chicken, and salmon. It was really delicious. I haven't had something that tasty in a while. So impressed! Finally, as if all this wasnt enough we had a trifecta of desserts! A rice pudding with cinnamon and possibly cardamom? Baklava with pistachios and a tiramisu! I'm so full but ready to go again! Wonderful food from a wonderful family!"}
{"text":"Great location with nice patio that was dog friendly. Food was pretty good but not the best Mediterranean I've ever had."}
{"text":"Happened upon this unassuming place one night when we couldn't get into Soba because it was so packed, including the bar.  The interior of the place is quite barren.  Just some very basic table and chairs and light music.  It looks more like a lunch place.    However, when we glanced at the menu we decided we would give it a try.  For an appetizer, I had the humus and a yogurt type dip (sorry forget the name!).  Both were excellent!    And then I ordered the fresh mozzarella panini, which came with fresh mozzarella, fresh basil, and tomatos on a buttered panini bread.  Quite tasty!!!    Definitely will be back.  I don't know that I would plan on coming to this place for a nice meal on the weekend due to their being no ambiance, but definitely would come here for lunch or a quick bite to eat at night."}
{"text":"I love Turkish food and was excited to try this quaint, family-owned restaurant nestled on Ellsworth Ave in Shadyside. The dining area is beautifully decorated and they also have an adorable outdoor space in which it would be lovely to enjoy a meal on a nice day (it was a tad chilly when we went, so we opted to dine indoors).  There was one waitress and while she was a little stoic in demeanor, she was perfectly polite and very attentive. We started with the pilaki appetizer, which were pinto beans, tomatoes, onions and garlic with olive oil. It was served with a round of pita bread. It was really delicious! The beans were cooked to perfection and very flavorful. The pita bread was probably the best I've ever had...the perfect level of soft and fluffy. I wish they would've given more than one pita round though, as we had a lot of extra pilaki and would have liked to have eaten it with more bread (and especially considering the price, it seems like they can spare more than one pita round).  For dinner, my husband ordered the doner (gyro) kabob, which was sliced pieces of lamb served with white rice and cacik (yogurt sauce). He reported that the meat was tender and well-seasoned and the cacik was a perfect complement to his meal. For myself, I got the chicken kabob with rice and bulgur pilaf (subbed for fries, which seems like an odd side dish to serve with Turkish food). The chicken was very flavorful, although a bit dry. The portion of rice and bulgur were very generous, but a bit bland (rice, of course, is usually bland, but I had higher hopes for the pilaf). I stole a bit of my husband's cacik and mixed it into my meal, and it improved the flavor tremendously. Next time I'll order some of my own.   Overall, the food is made fresh and it's much healthier than traditional restaurant offerings, and I'm a fan of that. However, in terms of taste, it was a mixed bag. And prices are high. Considering all of that, I'd say it was a 3.5 star meal. I'd definitely return at some point, but it's not somewhere that I'm going to rush back to."}
{"text":"When Daphne Cafe opened I was excited to try it.   I walk by it every day and it seemed like the place I would get lunch from on the weekends or grab a dinner to go on the way home from work.  After one trip, I haven't been back.  I really appreciate it when restaurants post their menu online; as a vegetarian I can be prepared to go elsewhere if there's nothing on the menu.  Daphne doesn't have a website, but there is now a photo of the menu on urbanspoon.  Sometimes they have a chalkboard with the menu taped to it outside the door.  We went to Daphne to get dinner to go, and it was a disappointment.  Their credit card machine was broken, which I can understand, but they didn't tell us until after they had taken our order and put it in.  I got the veggie wrap, which was some sad lettuce, tomatoes, and onions on hummus.  The gyro looked much more satisfying than my meal for sure.    The restaurant is never busy, despite the reasonable prices and BYOB.  Maybe it will pick up in the spring when the patio seating opens."}
{"text":"Wandered in from the street and was absolutely delighted. They have turkish coffee, fantastic baba, eggplant and the Daphne wrap is amazing. Family business with high quality, authentic food. Would definitely return if I am in the area."}
{"text":"nice place halal food tasty but i hope next time food will be better service nice girl :) i will returning next time  and try another entrees"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. Very quaint and quiet place with a nice patio. Started with the mixed appetizer, Hummus, Ezme (vegetable side dish) and Eggplant with sauce (opted for it cold)  with fresh warm pita and cacik to dip. Everything on this plate was delicious. Also split a gyro wrap. The lamb was so tender and the flavors of the wrap came together nicely. There was one lady working so hard. She was very helpful. Glad we stopped. Hope to get back there soon!"}
{"text":"As far as Turkish cuisine goes, Daphne is definitely my favorite of the options in Pittsburgh. I guess if your Turkish friends say it's their favorite, as well, I can be optimistic that my tastebuds aren't too far off. The atmosphere is very casual and simple, but don't let that fool you. The food is spectacular!  We usually go in groups of 4+, so we always share mixed appetizer plates and get most of the apps on the menu. You really can't go wrong with any of the starters, but I'm obsessed with their eggplant with sauce. If I have to round out my perfect mixed app order, I'd add the Mediterranean dip and Lebni, then devour it all with a big smile on my face. The portions are such that you'll rarely have enough pita initially.  My go-to platter is the Iskender Kebab: Doner kebab over diced pita with melted butter, sauce, yogurt and tomato. It's definitely a lot of food to down, but it's delicious and I order it...every...single...time. Their sauce isn't watered down, the pita isn't too soggy most of the time, and they're generous with the yogurt. It's a great combination of flavors, temperatures, and textures. My wife is obsessed with the Adana, and I've tried the lamb chops, chicken and plain doner kebab. All delicious. If you can't decide, just order the mixed grill, but I'd definitely say the Iskender is still my favorite dish that I've tried.  The staff has always been nice to us. I love that it's a family-run business. Literally a husband, wife, and their daughter manning the restaurant, almost exclusively. The plus side of such an operation is the pride that goes into the food and the real appreciation that they seem to show the customers. The downside to such a small operation is that service can be slow, especially in larger groups and peak times. Daphne isn't a place that you choose if you're in a rush. We've always made an event of it, whether for dinner or lunch. If you have the patience, though, the food certainly won't disappoint! The apps will come out quickly to satiate your initial hunger, but the platters may take a while. Of course, as a BYOB establishment, I'm sure you'll be able to occupy yourself while waiting for your entree.   For dessert, the Baklava is the safe bet, but the Kunefe is the real winner for me. Shredded wheat layers, with a sweet cheese filling, topped with syrup and pistachio. If you haven't had it, I definitely recommend. It's such a savory, yet sweet dessert. Served warm, it's simply phenomenal! Just be aware that it takes about 20 minutes, so order when your entree arrives to speed things up!  Overall, Daphne is a great place for a group. You won't feel rushed, the food is wonderful, and you're supporting an appreciative family-run business. Aside from slower service, Daphne really is an unassuming gem in the city!"}
{"text":"I like this place for a few reasons:  -The menu is simple but has plenty of options (especially good for dining with people on various special diets). -The execution is consistent. -The servers are friendly. -What really pushes it into four stars: the patio area is sufficiently set back from the street that it offers one of the better outdoor dining experiences in the neighborhood (making Daphne Cafe more attractive when the weather's nicer).  There are no reasons I dislike this place."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised it took me this long to check this place out, but I'm glad I did. I really love mediterranean, and didn't even realize this place was!  Service was quick and friendly. You can tell the owner is passionate about his food, as he was out running around delivering food to tables, checking on everyone, and taking time to chat with us.   It was one of the first really nice days of the year, and everyone was sitting outside on their cute little patio, so we got to enjoy the fresh air.   We got an order of baba ganoush with pita, and it was tasty. There wasn't a lot of pita, but we asked for more and they gladly brought it out.    I was worried I'd still be hungry because all I got was the falafel wrap, but it was huge! So I'm glad I didn't order anything else, because I was more than full when I was done with that.  I noticed some people saying they didn't like the server, but from what I experienced, she did her job well. Maybe it's just the difference of culture for some people.  Coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Daphne Cafe is a family run establishment with delicious food. We used to live two blocks away so we dined here all the time. Service can be spotty, especially with one particular server who doesn't look too happy to be there. Otherwise, their chicken is always perfectly cooked and their dips are excellent! If you like lamb, their iskender kebab is really really good too.   They have a cute patio that provides a wonderful place to hang out when it is warm outside."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I checked this place out because we were craving gyros.. and boy did we come to the right spot! Delicious, fresh Mediterranean food. I was also pleasantly surprised at how large the portion sizes were.  Very intimate and welcoming space, and the outdoor seating was lovely."}
{"text":"Sorry Daphne Cafe but I wasn't too impressed and for a number of reasons.   The place was hardly packed but our server never filled our water, asked how the meal was, or cleared the table. I overlooked that but the fact that they never told us how to pay so we sat there waiting like idiots was my biggest complaint.  The waitress didn't particularly seem to enjoy working so it left us feeling a little awkward.    So besides the service the food was good - not great.  I went with a group and we ordered a mozzarella panini, daphne panini, gyro panini, and gyro wrap along with a side of fries. My friends got the turkish coffee which came out in these really cute ornate cups but it wasn't a lot considering the fact that you pay 2 dollars for a little more than a mouthful of coffee.  Careful though, it's pretty strong.   I wasn't particularly blown away with the food, the gyro wrap didn't have enough sauce on it so the wrap seemed a bit dry.  The daphne panini wasn't to my taste and seemed exceptionally simple for something that was supposed to be \"special.\"   Overall, I don't think I'll come back, but the restaurant did have a great feel to it.  The outdoor seating seemed popular on the day that we went."}
{"text":"Food and service were excellent! We got the spicy taboulleh to start, then a gyro wrap and veggie sandwich. Prices are quite low, matched with great food... Highly recommend.  On a nice day, definitely sit on the patio outside."}
{"text":"Friendly place for Mediterranean and Turkish food. Tried a couple of different sandwiches and the dips. The hummus and red pepper sip were especially good! Finished our meal with Turkish coffee served in beautiful silverware. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place, and especially since we live a block away, we come quite frequently for their gyro sandwiches and falafel which are quite tasty and for a great value. Is it the most amazing falafel/gyro in the world? Probably not. But it's that kind of home cooked good that keeps you coming back regularly on a regular day."}
{"text":"Where do I start...first and foremost the food tasted like it was straight out of a Turkish kitchen. Fresh!!!  The pita bread was fluffy, warm and airy. We got the combo platter which was enough food for 2. The lamb was tender and perfectly seasoned. I could have continued to eat even though I was full. We finished it off with the most perfect of desserts. The rice pudding. Never have I had rice pudding that was as creamy as this. It just married your tastebuds with the slight citrus flavor and perfectly cooked rice. Seriously, I would eat it over ice cream any day!"}
{"text":"This is a great family run establishment. There were several things on the menu that I wanted to try, but wanted to keep it healthy. I had the chicken salad and the chicken was cooked perfectly, the salad was great. Our table also had some humus which was some of the best I have had. I don't remember what my wife had, but I remember that she really liked it."}
{"text":"Hello Pittsburgh - Love the city and the people - had a great visit!  Found this little place nestled away on I believe what's called Shady Side area of town - which is beautiful.    On with the review -  I had the HOME MADE (in house) Turkish Doner (Gyro) with Bulgar along with side salad.  Exceptional - rare to find homemade Doner - so when I found this place I was psyched - and it exceeded expectations.  The Doner is thinly shaved and has an added peppery flavor.  Also tried the bulgar, which was great.  This was my second night - the first night I tried the sampler platter which included Flavor filled Lamb Chops, Moderately spiced  yet flavorful Adana kabob, MOIST and tender chicken breast kabob and the Doner.  All were superb.  Truly Authentic Turkish meal.  Try the Non-GMO Organic Turkish Tea - be sure to ask how it's grown.  Overall experience was great - The owners were warm and welcoming - they enjoy sharing their culture. The music added to the experience - was able to decompress from the day and do some reading while eating.  Felt like an evening at a friend's place relaxing.  Great find indeed!"}
{"text":"BYOB...Enjoyed the outside seating today.  Very nice and clean place, inside and out.  It seems that there is only one waitress, but our dishes did come out promptly.  The Mediterranean dip with warm pita was delicious.  It was mostly tomato based with olives, walnuts and a drizzle of olive oil.  The stuffed grape leaves were tender with a hint of citrus, served with tzatziki sauce.  The Greek salad was your standard and was decent as Greek salads go.  Iskender kabap was the entree.  It was Gyro meat in a nice tomato broth over pita with a few grilled peppers and tomato.  The Baklava was probably the best I have ever tasted.  I was not blown away by anything that we ate and, for my taste buds ... I wish it was a bit more spicy and I did need to add some salt.  The service was friendly and all in all, the meal was pleasant and affordable."}
{"text":"The chicken wrap, chicken salad, Mediterranean dip and Babaganoush (and the warm pita) are my favorite dishes here. The chicken is seasoned perfectly, and so juicy. It's BYOB, which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"I'd consider Daphne to be a Mediterranean restaurant with a few Turkish options as opposed to a Turkish restaurant. That said, I opted for a house special - the Daphne Panini. It was made with Surek - described as a beef pepperoni - which intrigued me to try it. Essentially, the panini was a spicy meatball sandwich.  At the time of this review, the cafe was understaffed; however, it is searching for new employees, so I expect that to change soon."}
{"text":"It's always clean. The food is always fresh. Great taste. The baba is outstanding. Salads have gotten smaller since it opened but still a good deal. Hope they do well."}
{"text":"Healthy, delish Mediterranean menu. Fresh, quick, reasonably priced. I would go back."}
{"text":"We have been here many many times and have never had anything that was excellent. Truly a great place that deserves far more traffic."}
{"text":"The food was decent however the service was lacking. We went as a group and were treated with unwarranted condescension. The place was rather empty with maybe 1 other group dining in. Our server, was impatient and came off impolite. In her defense, we were probably a bit loud, but again the place was practically empty. She would remind us that there would be extra charges for which we were okay with. She seemed annoyed and eager to see us out.  Of note, this has happened at a previous occasion with another group. The server at that time behaved very similarly. The food was relatively enjoyable but the service sullied the experience."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere and decent food.  We tried the hummus, eggplant with sauce, and ezme.  The hummus and ezme were decent but nothing to write home about, and the eggplant with sauce was delicious.  The hummus appetizer also came with a very stingy portion of pita, barely enough to even eat half of the hummus.  Additional pita costs extra $$.  Probably the most off-putting aspect of the experience was the service.  We started with an appetizer of hummus but then decided to split the mixed appetizer platter as our meal.  Our interactions with our server misled us to believe that we could count the hummus as part of our mixed appetizer platter, so we only listed two other dips that we wanted.  Then, when the order came out, we had a platter of those two dips and *another* order of hummus.  Had we known that we had to choose three separate new dips for the platter, we would certainly have ordered something new as our 3rd choice.  We felt very misled by the server and she did not apologize when we seemed confused, though she did explain that the portion sizes for each of the dips in the appetizer platter were smaller than they are when ordering an isolated appetizer.  I think I'll give this place another shot to try some of their other food since there are many other rave reviews of the wraps/gyros/etc, and I bet the outdoors seating will be super cute when the weather is warmer."}
{"text":"We had a party of 4 for Saturday afternoon lunch. One other couple in the whole place. While the Baba app was good, the rest of the food was mediocre at best when it finally did arrive about 40 minutes later (I'd asked for more pita bread for the apps which was never brought until the rest of the food arrived). Waitress (and owner) dropped one of the sandwiches on the floor bringing it to the table - I would have normally always sent this back, but we had waited long enough for food already, were quite hungry, and so - as she seemed quite discombobulated at her job - graciously accepted it anyway. Then she charged full price for it on the bill on top of that! I heard a take-out customer exasperated by the high bill, as was I. Stay clear of this place: terrible service (by the owner yet), unexceptional food, and definitely overpriced. Want the best mid-eastern food in Pgh? Med Grill on Forbes in Squirrel Hill - I'm wishing we'd have gone there..."}
{"text":"The Best Turkish food ever. You can not find anything frozen or premade. Everything is so fresh and tasty. There is really nothing comperable for me, so If I like to eat Medeteranian food I always go Daphne.  Me and my wife used to eat their kebabs salads and their mixed appetizer plate then when we tried their fish that is shipping from mediterranian sea is just so delicious. Its sad that they dont have it all the time but I would recommend you to ask if they have fish.   Their prices are also great you will be paying double when you go to brandy restaurands and you wont even get the same freshness and taste."}
{"text":"Service here is not great. Our server did not smile and spoke to us dispassionately. We ordered the lamb rack (comes with salad and rice) and kofte (comes with fries and rice). The lamb was cooked and seasoned well. The kofte was also good but came in tomato sauce, which in my experience is unusual and which I had missed on the menu. If you are in the minority and don't like tomato sauce (like me), it is easy to just use a knife and remove the sauce from the kofte. That's what I did and I was able to enjoy the kofte more. Daphne Cafe is a nice, quiet Mediterranean place for those who want to dine at a low-key restaurant.  Taste | 3.5 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3 Service | 2 OVERALL | 3"}
{"text":"Ever since I came back from spring break in Greece, I have been obsessed with Mediterranean food. I hadn't explored many of the aforementioned cuisine here in Pittsburgh, though. I found this place and it looked great. Upon walking into the dining room, I knew that I would have a great experience. Not being super hungry, we just ordered an appetizer sampler and a Greek salad. This was enough to fill me up, surprisingly. The sampler was the best option in order to maximize utility for your dollar. The Greek salad was very fresh. I always like to try new things and so I ordered a Camlica. It was a carbonated beverage similar to a Sprite and very delicious! I will be back soon to try more!"}
{"text":"Daphne is a new-ish Shadyside restaurant that Tony and I had been wanting to check out for a bit. It is Turkish/Mediterranean, but there aren't a ton of full entrees. The menu was mostly appetizers (baba ghannouj, hummus, etc), wraps, and salads. I had the adana (lamb) wrap, and my boyfriend has the gyro salad. His had a ton of meat compared to mine, but his salad also had a sweeter Greek salad dressing which I really liked. I liked my wrap but wish there was more meat in it. The boyfriend also had the Turkish coffee, and I had the custard dessert which was small, but VERY filling. We might be coming back since we realized Daphne was BYOB (corkage fee was 3 or 4 bucks). I wish there were more entrees on the list, but it would make more sense next time to split some of the appetizers and maybe a salad as a main dish."}
{"text":"While out and about on a Saturday evening, after a movie in Squirrel Hill, we were wanting to find something for dinner, but were wanting something we'd never had. Our 'getting out' is usually only in a couple of neighborhoods, and we were frankly bored and not in the mood for those usual offerings.  Shadyside has become one of those 'we never go there because there's nothing to do there' neighborhoods, other than to shop for uppity boutiqueries, or eat at pretentious South-Beach-Wannabe bistroids. But, since we were driving down the hill, we thought we'd take a short walk and see what we found...and we found Daphne's.  A totally and completely UNpretentious building and atmosphere that was nearly missed as we walked down Ellsworth. We peeked at the menu through the window and decided to give it a try.  It IS simple. It IS unpretentious. And it is good.  I've been around the Turkish cuisine for a few years having had a friend who specialized in Turkish cuisine, but kind of ran out of steam in exploring others. I am quite happy to have stopped to smell the kofta...and to have bitten into it as well.  I have no idea what the space used to be. But they have transformed it into a very basic large room with a lot of decorative kitsch that hint at Turkish. Small tables, a cashier counter and a kitchen. A little light classical music in the background. It is very simple.  I noticed in several of the reviews the service is whined about. Now I know we're in Shadyside and hipsterisms and uppity attitudes are expected, so maybe just basic table service is sooooo passe here. But our service was absolutely fine. Waitress came, waitress took orders, waitress brought orders, waitress made sure we were ok, and waitress brought check. Basically, that's all I ask for in a restaurant. My backside does not need to be kissed, nor does my ego need stroking.   We both ordered the Turkish coffee, which did come in a tinier demitasse than usual...so tiny it was actually a little hard to hold the handle. But the coffee was pure black heaven. As an appetizer, we split an order of the falafel, which came with pita, lettuce and tomato, with a tahini dipping sauce. The falafel was insanely delicious, and the pita was cut into somewhat larger than tortilla chip size, so it was like making tiny sandwiches. Total yum.  I ordered the Kofta burger, and my better half ordered the kofta entree with rice.  The burger came medium rare, just as I love them, with a huge amount of flavor and juice. Served up with a side of fries. I could have done without the fries. Just regular ol' squished out of a playdough machine frozen restaurant fries. Nothing special. The burger came on a nice bun with lettuce and tomato, and the menu said pickles, but mine arrived with onions, which I can't eat. I asked for my usual mayo or dark mustard, and all they had was the usual ball park day-glo yellow mustard. I decided against anything and ate it bare, and I'm happy I did. The meat flavor was terrific. After sampling a little of the sauce that accompanied my other half's kofta entree, I honestly wondered why they didn't automatically offer THAT as a burger sauce. It's delicious, and really tastes like it belongs on that burger. I highly suggest they just offer that.  The price was as reasonable as reasonable can get in Shadyside, the service was fine, and the food was Turkilicious. When you're over the pomp and circumstance of Shadyside, give it a try. I'd actually make a point to go back again. No frills, but no attitude.   It's quite nice to see something simple and not aimed at bourgeoisie in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, tasty, and quick food.    Usually come here when there's a craving for tabouli or humus.  The pita bread is nice and warm when it comes to the table.  I had a panini last time which was delicious.  Fresh mozzarella and nice warm, soft bread.  If you're looking for a quick bite to eat or a quiet place then I would recommend this place.  Vegan/vegetarian options.  There's also outdoor seating in a cute patio area if you want to eat outside and people watch."}
{"text":"I live so close to here and I don't know why it took me so long to try this place!!  First I'll talk about the service, I agree with most of the reviews about being understaffed because there was only one girl waiting on all the tables (not busy yet still not attentive to customers needs? Super nice though). I feel bad because I did notice the \"HELP WANTED\" sign, so they're searching!! The owner, on the other hand, is INCREDIBLY accommodating!!! Brought my dog and sat down with my friends (who grabbed a table outside) then the owner politely asked me to anchor him onto a tree on the sidewalk then suggested we sit on the sidewalk and put together tables for us :) options is always a wonderful thing!!  Now the best part, FOOD!! Let me just say that this chicken on the chicken salad I had was probably one of the best chicken I've ever had in my life-- tender, cooked perfectly. Tried my friend's hummus and dip (I forget what it was called but it was red) oh my goodness... So smooth, creamy yet bursting with flavor every bite!! Pita bread = perfection and warm.  Love this place!! Can't wait to try more!!"}
{"text":"Daphne Cafe is still a solid place for us to go and grab a bite to eat. Everything is always consistently tasty and the service always friendly. We still get the mediterranean dip with extra pita and really anything with gyro meat though we've had chicken, adana/lamb, and falafel. One thing that is great news for us is that Daphne Cafe is pup friendly on the patio so long as your dog is on a leash. It was a hot day on our most recent visit and upon our request they brought out a bowl of ice for our pup who loved it."}
{"text":"A bunch of colleagues and I just came back from dinner at this fabulous place. The food was delicious and the owners were delightful. To top it off we finished with Turkish Coffee, which was incredible, and the owners homemade rice pudding was to die for! What a hidden gem in Pittsburgh and being from New York, I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Little Mediterranean restaurant with good choices on the menu if you're craving falafel / doner / kebab / hummus / pita. It's more of a sit-down restaurant rather than fast food, you'll get table service.  The falafel I ordered was fine - I certainly had tastier ones (overall it was bit dry and I was missing some more yogurt sauce). By reading the reviews here I was surprised that \"friendliness\" was mentioned by almost every Yelper. I didn't get a smile and a rather cold sent-off when I paid my $9.10 falafel with a $10 - not sure if tip was expected!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch, best Mediterranean I've had so far in Pittsburgh! Everything was fresh and the service was quick and friendly. Outdoor seating is great on sunny days. This place is bomb diggity."}
{"text":"Ate there last night (Saturday) for dinner. BF and I both got the gyro (lamb) platters. There was a lot of meat and the sides we got were good - I really liked the bulgar pilaf and the salad had a light oil dressing on it which was yummy. The serving size was pretty great for the price and the food came out quickly.  It wasn't really very busy which was nice that we were attended to quickly. The waitress could use a little more pep, though. Overall, we are glad to have found a mediterranean place that we like. We will def be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. I loved the Iskender Kebap! The patio has a real nice ambience and the service was very friendly."}
{"text":"One chick working the whole restaurant.  That sucks, right?  But it wasn't busy at all.  At.  All. So the fact that my water wasn't refilled ever... Our hummus came out after 20 minutes.... The extra pita bread we asked for never came... She wouldn't even give us another menu willingly... was very irritating.    I'm a big fan of good service (gee... who isn't!?) but I tend to give A LOT of leeway to people because I was a server.  Today, it was hard for me to do so.    The hummus was actually really good and the pita bread was awesome.  Came out warm and moist.  The gyro salad was not bad.  I liked the meat, but it was a pretty simple salad.  I've had much more creative/better ones.    I think I'd give it another try because I did like the hummus, but I pray the service gets better because I may start throwing around some pita bread... if I ever got some extra slices!"}
{"text":"This ranks up there with one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! Hands down! I don't even know where to start, everything on this menu is incredible, very authentic! The outdoor seating area is comfortable!"}
{"text":"Daphne's has very tasty, healthy Turkish food and an especially cute patio.  I like dropping by in the summertime to sit in the sunshine and grab lunch on the weekend.  It's an under-appreciated spot in Shadyside-- I have never seen it crowded.  The interior is very casual and less welcoming than the outside. A few more decorations and music/ambiance would make it feel more like a sit-down place and les like a take-out spot.   One bone to pick--they charge (or used to charge) an absurd amount (maybe $6 extra?) to add a protein like chicken to their salads.  This seems really silly to me and disproportionately pricey; I hope they have changed that.  They have an excellent Greek salad and I'd be a much happier camper if I could get a little chicken on it and not pay $15 dollars, when everything else on the menu is in the $8-10 range."}
{"text":"So I'm currently waiting and NO ONE is here to help. There are two customers and it looks like the waitress only wants to serve me after the couple have ordered, gotten their food and leaves. This happens and I wait some more before a man (although very nice) takes my order in between talking on the phone. I get my food and I can't believe I paid $20 for this!   I don't know what makes Turkish food different from Middle Eastern food but it was dry. I only devoured it bc in a poor college student.   I'm most likely not coming back and I'm spreading the word. The waitress looks hella mad like she's their daughter and was pissed she had to work at all! The baklava was soggy and it was just a bad time."}
{"text":"I have eaten here now on multiple occasions. It's both a good date spot and family dinner venue.   The restaurants is family owned, which becomes clear as soon as you're greeted by the owner himself! Him and his wife run the kitchen, and it's not uncommon to be treated to a free glass of wine (if you forget to bring your own) or appetizer.   Speaking of appetizers, the Trio is excellent as it lets you sample three different appetizers. I recommend the homemade hummus, the Mediterranean dip, and whatever else you'd like to add. Everything is delicious and fresh.   For my entree, I without a doubt order the Iskender kebab plate every time. Delicious kebab meat and pita bread soaked in a buttery tomato-based sauce with fresh yogurt to complement it. So. Freaking. Good. It's a little pricey ($17) but it is absolutely worth it.   All in all, this place continues to top my list as a Pittsburgh favorite and one that I return to again and again."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food is always amazing. The outside seating is cozy during the summer. The service is kind of slow, so don't plan on having a quick dinner, but it's only slow because they make everything from scratch. This is a real family owned restaurant, which is a rare treat. Also, I have never had to wait for a table here which is amazing."}
{"text":"If there's a porch I can sit at that absolutely transforms the vibe and view of Ellsworth Ave into something close to \"romantic\"....bonus points!! Also, tiny Turkish coffees on giant Turkish gold platters with a delicious tiramisu of unknown origin...regular points!! Who knew this place was so neat - and affordable, too, judging solely by dessert experience and a cursory reading of the full menu. Should have asked who Daphne was."}
