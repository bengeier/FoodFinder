{"text":"Was here few months ago after the solar eclipse and liked where  this place was going. But just had a horrible experience just recently when the staff was flat out rude about my nephew bringing in outside food because he's picky and won't eat high scale food. Instead of making exception for his cystic fibrosis and letting the rest of us (6 in the group) order food and drink we were told we couldn't be served while the outside food was there. 100% a let down in the midst of great breweries and restaurants in the area. Highly recommend NOT going here"}
{"text":"The food was good,  but the service and  the manager were horrible!  14 of us were enjoying food, beer,  wine and our friends in the tent. When THE HEATER STOPPED WORKING, it was FREEZING, and we wanted to relocate inside. Even though there were at least 6 empty tables,  they would not let us in.  WHY?  Because we already finished eating. WTH??!!? Speaking to the manager did no good. He was a complete a**hole. We took our group and went to Triple C. They wanted our money, and treated us with respect. We will NEVER RETURN TO HYDE. First and last time for me!!"}
{"text":"Outdoor seating area was a nice area to have a drink.  Venue was busy because other breweries were not opening for an hour or so.  Not sure if staffing was prepared for business the day after Christmas but service was slow.  When our party ordered a couple of flights from the bar it took 15-20 minutes to be served and there was some rudeness from the staff.  Hoping it was just the lack of service staff and increase in business that caused the issue."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed myself at the brewery. Family friendly atmosphere...even dogs are allowed. Although I'm not a fan of beer I enjoyed my glass of win. The bathrooms were spotless. The layout was perfect. Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Terrible unfreindly waitress! Stuffy vibe for a brewery. No flights available for a slow Sunday night. Did not offer a sample of any beer, although there is a huge selection not able to try before you buy. Sold out of several beers and some food entries. It's a shame because the food and the beer I did have was good."}
{"text":"We visited a lot of breweries on our stay, and Hyde was one of the first that we tried. 

The space was really neat, a very cool indoors paired with an outdoor patio. Since it was cooler outside it looks like they cover the patio up for the weather and then open it up when it is nicer out. 

As far as the beer...none of us had the same beers and only 1 of the 4 brews the group had was drinkable. I didn't even finish my beer (very rarely does that happen). 

When I asked the staff questions I didn't get a lot of help on making a good selection. We were outside and it was decently crowded, but by no means was it \"packed\". 

Our friends later told us they had been here once before and weren't thrilled then either. To me the two experiences speak for itself. I wanted to love it!"}
{"text":"I went to the grand opening, which was a blast with an outside bar and live music, and then back last week for some happy hour beers.  I had a good experience - i love the big tables outside, but the bartender was pretty rude to me when I asked for a beer recommendation.  Other than that, the beer I chose was great, and it is dog friendly which is a huge plus!"}
{"text":"Fantastic beer and a cool atmosphere. Wide variety of their own brews and plenty of other local beers to try. The Hyde beers are unique and tasty. Worth a trip."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and my local friend brought me to a few breweries - this stop was a must as we biked down the rail trail. She raved about the Bloody Mary's with picked okra. I came to drink local crafts and was not disappointed (the Alorah Maple Ale and Lavender Skies). We also split some appetizers and the pimento cheese with bacon jam almost brought tears to our eyes. Round of applause to the potato/chorizo croquettes as well. We were even able to watch some March Madness on the giant TVs and had great bartenders. Not sure why this place only has 3 stars because I loved my visit and would recommend to any friend visiting Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun. My girlfriend and I stopped in on a late Sunday morning as part of a city brewery crawl. We had already eaten breakfast so we didn't get a chance to sample their brunch, but the place was certainly hopping at 11am. Tons of wide open seating space, large windows and doors that let the outside in. An industrial vibe to the inside that is tempered by lots of green plants hanging from the ceiling. 

They have a staggering number of taps to fit any palate. Our bartender was generous with tastes as we were unfamiliar with some of the offerings. Barley wine was smooth and rich, the wit was bright tasting and cloudy gold in color. Even with a sampling plank, we would have to return multiple times to try everything they have to offer, and if I was a local, I would."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hot spot in south end. It's right on the light rail and they have a large outdoor area which is perfect in summer! They have a really extensive beer selection - however, I find that they run out of beers frequently. Menu is just okay .. I wouldn't come here for dinner but would enjoy some apps here. Great for day drinking, brewery hopping, or a night out."}
{"text":"We ate at Hyde for Brunch on Saturday. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated quickly. Love the decor! Our server, April, was very attentive. The food came out quickly and was nicely presented.  Overall, delicious tasting food, & the service (server and food runner) was excellent!"}
{"text":"One of the newer breweries that popped up in the Southend is Hyde Brewing. It is a really cool place with indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is first come first serve and is open to having dogs. EVERYONE who goes pretty much brings their dog. It is a really cool atmosphere, with rustic and greens. Hyde also serves food, which include many small plate items to share with the table. On of my favorites is the Pimento Cheese dip. It was a sweeter pimento cheese that included a sweet bacon jam on top. Definitely a must get to share with some friends. If you get a beer, go inside. They have more options inside. Not too thrilled with their selection of beer, I haven't found one I like from Hyde but they also serve wine and other cocktails. So if you're like me then head inside and grab a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for Hyde Brewing! I've been here twice recently - once with the Goose and once with my parents - and everyone has been really pleased with the venue and the beer.

On a sunny Saturday afternoon, this place was HOPPING. They have a great outdoor bar set up, although they don't have all of their beers offered. No worries, the Goose and I got set with a delicious delicious delicious American IPA and a Gose. Great outdoor space with some shade and giant wooden tables to accommodate everyone.

I also had a really good time coming back with my parents during a week day. Hyde Brewing has 20 beers that they brew themselves. We sampled a few and they were all really, really good. I enjoyed the ESB and the Citric Haze, while my parents both opted for darker options. I also appreciated that they had beers from other breweries on their menu, although I definitely want to try more Hyde branded brews!"}
{"text":"this place started out like a nice new place we would try..14 of us there for a birthday party and sat out in the enclosed patio area.most of our group ate food and drank beers however the longer we were out there the colder it got, even tho they had a couple of space type heaters it still was very cold. we decided we wanted to move inside where there was heat and to watch the panthers game. we went inside and there were 7 tables free and nobody waiting to sit, so we asked to sit at two tables. we were told we couldn't sit there, that the tables were for people ordering food. duh we already spent tons of money on food but they still wouldn't let us sit..my wife asked to speak with the manager who apologized but wouldn't bend a finger to accommodate our large group. so we all paid our tabs, expressed our opinions and went across the street to Triple C where they were more then accommodating to ALL of us. Told the bartender there of my experience and he gave me the three drinks I ordered for free. Will NEVER GO BACK to Hyde and will give my money to Triple C."}
{"text":"A few friends and I went to Hyde Brewing for some early morning coffee.  LOVE the location and vibe inside!  Great for alcohol, however they are not and should not be confused for a place that specializes in coffee.  Their coffee menu is vague and scantly composed.  It requires you to have more than a novice understanding of coffee to order something from their make-shift menu by the register.  The lady who took our order was very patient and helpful with making our coffee ideas come to fruition.  The place is very warm and inviting, with plenty of places to sit.  The product they offer is very tasty!  I would certainly go back, but next time I would go for the alcohol options to see how it compares to the coffee ordering."}
{"text":"On a gorgeous weekday afternoon, my wife and I took our child on a train ride uptown to get lunch and walk around.  On the ride up we saw Hyde as the train made it's stop at the New Bern platform - and they might as well made the stop in the brewery!  After eating and walking around we got on the train and our son told us to goto the brewery (I swear!), so we jumped off at New Bern and rolled into the place like we owned it.

You enter through double glass doors into a covered outdoor area with long wood tables with planters in the middle of them.  Enter another set of double doors into the main bar area - filled with booths, high tops, and a long bar that wraps around to a coffee/espresso area.  Why you would ever go to a brewery and get coffee I don't know - but I guess the train station being there makes it convenient to people - but no one should rate this place based on a coffee experience!  

Our bartender was excellent - when we asked about getting a flight - he informed us of the $3 any Charlotte beer special - and basically sold us on getting 2 points each versus 2 flights for a little cheaper.  He knew the beer on tap, and started handing us samples before we could ask.  We selected our first beer and started to head to the covered patio area.  Upon seeing an outdoor picnic table area - we ran out there with the 2 girls that were enjoying the weather with their puppy.  

Our kid ran around playing with the gravel rocks that was laid over the area and watched the construction, trains and people.  We grabbed 2 more beers each after that and some french fries.

The Beer was tasty - not the best I've ever had, but much better than some other places.  The fries were good, albeit a small portion.  The weather was perfect, the bartender was awesome, and the girls at the other table were good eye candy for my wife to yell at me for looking at!  It was an excellent visit and we want to go back!  A great excuse to take your kid for a train ride!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place since it is a few blocks from my house. Food is very solid but nothing special for the price. The space is just great. Simply gorgeous. Mixed drinks are insanely overpriced. I generally never get sticker-shock when I get the tab, but when I opened the bill my jaw dropped. This is the type of price I would expect from a rooftop bar like Merchant & Trade but not from this place. This isn't Punch Room... come on. The staff seems fine but they have only one speed... slow. They are nice enough but again, very, painfully slooooow and appear to be lacking in service industry experience. When it is busy, as it usually is, this makes for a long frustrating wait. Bartender didn't know what a pilsner was. I'll be back because of the location but I doubt I'll ever stay for more than a drink or two."}
