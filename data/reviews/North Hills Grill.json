{"text":"Great food!  There were 3 of us in our party and we all tried different menu items.  The smoothies were delicious... Not overly sweet.  We tried the mango cream, island strawberry, and green mango.  Potato soup was very flavorful.  We also ordered chicken quesadillas, chicken+feta+apple+cranberry wrap, sweet potato fries, cheese steak sandwich with regular fries.  Everything was delicious and beautifully presented.   I wasn't a real fan of the styrofoam serving containers since we were eating there... Felt a bit too casual... But otherwise the experience was great and we will definitely return.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I don't know what ppl are saying about the service, my girlfriend and I stopped in and the owner was cool as s#*t. The food was awesome and came quickly. Plus there aren't many places where you can get a burger and fries and a humus wrap in the same joint. Enough said"}
{"text":"Delicious.  Have gone many times and yet to be disappointed. The fries are amazing. Only suggestion is do not get the fries to go because they get soggy in the to-go container (as any fries would)."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim and so glad I did. I had a Veggie quesadilla and a cup of Broccoli soup and it was DELICIOUS!! Made fresh while you wait and I could tell the ingredients were fresh as well. My partner had the Chicken quesadilla and she loved it as well. It was slow so w had a chance to talk with the owner who was very welcoming   We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Homemade broccoli cheddar soup was fantastic.  I had the veggie foccacia sandwich which is everything you could want in a veggie foccacia.  Absolutely delicious.  For a side I got the quinoa which I was not a fan of, but my boyfriend liked it.  He ordered the cajun chicken sandwich which he really liked.  His only complaint was that he wished there was sauce on it, but the chicken was flavorful and moist, so he ended up doing without.  He had the spicy black beans for a side which were good but not spicy as the name made them sound.

All in all, a really good and rather healthy place to eat in the North Hills, especially for the price.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Very good fresh food! Worth trying we will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"This place proves that you can't judge a book by its cover. From the outside, it doesn't look like anything special. Once you walk inside, you can see the extensive menu written on the wall. The offerings range from healthy (herbivore salads, quinoa, turkey burger with avocado) to the decadent (BBQ bacon cheeseburger). I've ordered from both ends of the spectrum and it is all delicious. It is very reasonably priced for the portion sizes and quality of the food. Overall, this is one of my favorite lunch spots and is good for when I need comfort food or want to eat some veggies."}
{"text":"First trip here for takeout on a Saturday night and it didn't quite meet our expectations, although we will be back.

My wife had the salad with fresh saut√©ed vegetables and Italian dressing. Very light, quality ingredients, and tasty from the bite I had and her reaction.

I had the Jerk chicken sandwich that really wasn't jerk chicken to me but still tasted good. Chicken was slight overlooked unfortunately but the red peppers and pineapple was a nice touch. Went with the sweet potato fries which was probably a mistake as takeout fries always end up not bringing crispy even though we live a mile away.

My wife went in to pick up the order and wanted to try the mixed berry smoothie, apparently the individual working had some trouble making it and you could tell, as it didn't taste great.

We love their menu though and will be back to give them another try."}
{"text":"I ordered a turkey avacado burger to be delivered.  The turkey was raw and pink and the avacado was a brown spoonful of something.   Coworker ordered the same thing and got the same as I did.  Tried to call them during business hours to let them know but they weren't answering.  Looking forward to being sick from eating raw and rotten food.  Thanks North Hills grill, you should offer sides of Imodium."}
{"text":"Ate here today for a late lunch. Had the Cajun sandwich and their fresh-cut fries. 

Wow! Everything was great. The sandwich was flavorful and the fries were fresh, hot and delicious! The service was prompt and helpful. 

Will for sure be back! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I generally am disappointed by the quality of food in the Pittsburgh area but I have found North hills little hidden gem. Great fresh food.  I have eaten here numerous times so far and am very impressed. Nothing I have had is frozen or from a bag. I love their steak sandwich. I was shocked to find it was real steak. I have also had their crab cake sandwich. It had lots of crab and very little filler. Delicious!!! Their salads are very fresh and not lacking in the taste department. I would def recommend this place for a good bite to eat. Serving sizes are huge and prices are very reasonable for what you get too!"}
{"text":"Horrible Food! READ ON Dirty, Too big of a Menu, 2 young girls operating the place clearly did not know what they were doing, smoothies are not fresh natural ingredients, they use aldies ice cream and store bought juice, it was a cold rainy day and it was even colder in the place, the floor was so sticky i almost lost a shoe, the entire place was just very unappealing ascetically. and the bathroom was even worse.

I ordered a smoothie, which taste wise was acceptable, but like i said it was not fresh ingredients, the tortilla soup looked disgusting and was disgusting. i took one bite there was no chicken, just water with soggy chunks of bread, plastic like cheese melted on top, i also had a Reuben the corned beef was overcooked and dried out like jerky, not the jerky you buy at the store. the kind of jerky that the cowboys took with them crossing the west.

I was very surprised to see so many positive reviews. I eat out often and i have never been so appalled with a meal that i had to create an account and give it a bad review, until today. first of all, as soon as i walked in i thought it looked like a dirty disorganized dump, but tried not to judge a book by its cover, They offer way too many sandwiches delis that are good specialize in maybe 8 sandwiches"}
{"text":"On my first visit there I was impressed with the quality and price of the food. However, I was really taken back by all the Styrofoam and disposable things they use. The only thing that wasn't disposable was the basket that  my food came in. Not all foods are served in a basket. Such an expense and a waste. When I first walked in that was my immediate impression-what a waste. Everywhere you looked there were Styrofoam cups, plates, disposable silverware."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, salads, and soup. It's amazing one guy in the back can make all this great food. Highly recommended. Check them out. Oh, they make very good smoothies with fresh ingredients. You get a discount if you add it to your sandwich. These fries are excellent as well, both regular and sweet potato."}
{"text":"My husband I I went in for the first time a week ago.  I ordered the fajitas and my husband ordered a burger.  The fajitas were good and I got a ton of food so much so that I wasn't able to finish most of my fries.  My husbands burger was a good size but he informed me that it didn't have much flavor. 

I can't wait to go back and try a wrap and a smoothie.  So it's a good place to get a good meal for a good price."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for delivery on lunch and realized everything that delivers in North Hills was a bunch of pizza and other unhealthy crap.

I've passed the Grill many times so I decided to order there since they had healthy options! I got the Buffalo Chicken Salad wrap along with a cup of soup (it looked like a quinoa chili?). I'm very particular about my wraps, and theirs was delicious! They used real grilled chicken, not questionable breaded meat, and their veggies were super fresh. The chili was delicious too! 

Plus - their delivery is free! 

There aren't many healthy delivery options, but this is definitely one of you're looking for lunch!"}
{"text":"After passing by this place, I finally stopped in. Food is good, fresh, and fast. Can't wait to try more things."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and my daughters and I absolutely love it.  With one super picky eater and one adventurous eater, finding a happy middle is tough.  

The kids menu has a nice selection: hot dog, chicken fingers (love that these are grilled and not breaded), quesadillas, and such.  You get a side with them that includes choices from applesauce and fresh fruit.  Both my girls adore their smoothie selection as well.  I've had two different salads now and have been very pleased.  Everything is very fresh and isn't your typical iceberg lettuce thrown in a bowl.  Other menu items include wraps, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  Great selection and the prices are very reasonable for what you're getting.

The decor itself is very fresh and inviting.  My daughters especially enjoy the wall art.

Try it out!  You'll like it."}
{"text":"North Hills Grill is unfortunately in a location where several businesses have tried and failed.  This is the first time I've actually had a chance to try one of these businesses before it was no more.  I hope North Hills Grill, a friendly family-run business, finally breaks the streak.

Why? Several reasons. Most importantly, it's on my way in to work so I can pick up dinner on my way in before an overnight shift.  I can also currently use my Just Pay Half Hot Card (https://www.justpayhalfpittsburgh.com/index.php?positionID=2927). But even better, the food is great.  I've tried the Chicken Caesar Wrap, the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and the Buffalo Chicken Wrap.  Each sandwich comes with a side and I've tried the Chicken Dumpling Soup, Fries and Fruit Salad.  Everything tastes fresh and homemade and I haven't been disappointed by anything (though the fries had a bit too much seasoning for my taste and burger was a bit messy).  Oh, did I mention they also make fresh fruit smoothies?  I've only tried the Mango but they offer a wide variety of flavors.  

I hope North Hills Grill is here to stay because I plan on returning as often as I can to try a few more of the sandwiches, sides, salads and smoothie flavors.  Stop in if you're nearby because I don't want them to go away!"}
{"text":"Really great food and extremely friendly service. Our meals were excellent and prepared quickly. The handcut fries were the real deal and crispy and hot! Lots of menu choices and we will definitely be back to try them all!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious lunch. I really wish that I would have tried this place before. I had the chicken quesadilla with black bean salad and opted for a 2nd side of quinoa salad just to try it. I have enough leftovers for 2 more meals. My other half had the steak sandwich and french fries and enjoyed it also. The mango cream smoothie was refreshing. Very reasonably priced for the amount of food that you get. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today with my father for lunch.  I had been wanting to try it since it had opened and whenever they helped a local race which was for a good cause, I made sure to head here.  The inside of the restaurant is inviting with wood floors, table with red tile tabletops and a bright blue couch that you can chill out in with magazines in front of it.  They also had their menu written on the wall which I found to be pretty cool.

For my entree I decided on the grilled caesar salad wrap.  I was pleased that I was given the choice between a wheat wrap or a regular wrap and it also came with a side.  The sides impressed me as they had a quinoa salad, spicy black beans and fresh cut regular and sweet potato fries, some of which seemed healthier than your normal selections.  I ended up choosing the quinoa salad which had quinoa, carrots, celery and red peppers in it.  It was pretty good and I ended up enjoying it.  My wrap was also good, warm with grill marks on the wrap and plenty of chicken and lettuce with the perfect amount of caesar dressing on the inside.  I was also able to try some of my dad's food and he ordered the reuben with fresh cut fries.  The fries came out warm, were salted perfectly and tasted nicely while he reuben was also good.  I thought that the amount of food given to us was perfect, enough to fill us up but no so much so that I would have to overeat to finish it.

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  I was impressed by the healthy options and quality of food that they had and I am looking forward to taking my girlfriend here."}
{"text":"I was in the area for lunch and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! I had the black bean burger with quinoa salad and a drink. It was $9 and was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I stumbled across this place on a Monday afternoon. We saw the good yelp reviews and had to give it a shot. We were surprised right away when we walked into the restaurant and saw how tiny it was. We estimated it at about 850 square feet.  Maximum capacity holds about 38 patrons. You got the feel that you were in somebody's living room. 

This place is also a smoothie bar so with our meals we ordered two smoothies. My wife got a gyro, I got a bbq bacon cheeseburger and the kids got a cheeseburger and chicken tenders. The food was excellent and the smoothies were delicious! Their French fries that came with the meals were like the potato patch at Kennywood. Our meal came to $32 so that's pretty reasonable. If we are ever in the area again we'll be sure to go back."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch one day and the food was pretty good.  It doesn't seem like much when you drive by (and if you know the area there have been many things in there over the years), but this is a nice little place.  The only problem we had was when we went there on a return trip, after they brought us all our food, they realized they forgot one of the orders in our group.  Because we were on a time constraint, that person didn't get to eat and was bitter (which I understand why).  That was the only bump in the road that we have encountered.  Basically, it's a nice little place that isn't extremely large but has decent food."}
{"text":"I am disappointed that I never realized this was here until recently. This place is a gem and you should RUN not walk here for a delicious, easy, affordable, meal. 

I encourage you to get up now and go. I stopped eating my buffalo chicken wrap (that I had the option of wheat wrap) to type this. You get a choice of 6 sides and all looked yummy. I know this because I stared at the food that was already on other people's tables.. Creepy but true. 

The grilled steak sandwich is actual large steak pieces and equally as delicious. 

Seriously, a gem find and I am eager to come back. 

Must finish eating now!"}
{"text":"This is a really unassuming place, where you literally just drive up to the door and walk in. But the food and smoothies(!) are pretty awesome, at least beyond my own expectations. We had a steak fajita as well as a Pittsburgh salad with chicken. Interestingly, they actually turned out to be pretty similar in terms of contents, with a lot of the same vegetables. The raspberry vinaigrette dressing and salsa, both of which were great complements, differentiated the two. The accompanying fries were crispy and well done, and portion sizes were huge. Finally, the smoothies were so tasty and creamy, all made from scratch with lots of real fruit."}
{"text":"This place is great! Perfect location for me, healthy & tons of options and very friendly. I got the buffalo chicken wrap with sweet potato fries. Delicious. I can't wait to try a smoothie. Will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Spending our Saturday regrouting  countertops is not necessarily the best idea when you have a whole family to feed. With this in mind we were on the outlook for healthy good lunch. Northhills Grill has been on my radar for quite a while and we took this opportunity to have a nice sitdown lunch. 
The location is easily accessible to the North Hills by Rochester Road and Route 19. The Decour is simple very IKEA-ish with bright colors and fun food pictures. The menu is written on a whiteboard wall and supports vegetarians to carnivores.
You order at a station, they prepare your food and bring it to the table. Food is prepared expertly but served in to go boxes. I assume this is because most of their orders are to go. 
I ordered the Santa Fe chicken salad in the seasoning on the chicken was perfect. My darling husband ordered the chicken Apple wrap with quinoa salad. The wrap was very flavorful with the Chrisp sweet apples and chicken. We also ordered two kids meals both of them had the one dollar upgrade to change a soda to a smoothie. My kids really love the smoothies and I love the fact that they were not drinking soda. One kids meal was grilled chicken tenders with fresh-cut sweet potato fries. The other kids meal was a homemade hamburger with cheese and wedding soup. I swear my kid could live off of wedding soup. 
My only wish for this place was that it was a little bit more sit down friendly. The floors were a bit sticky and I made sticky shoe notice  walking all the way across the restaurant. We will be going again and ordering out, I found the food to be much better than Panera's and a lot fresher."}
{"text":"The food is terrific! Fries are fresh cut and seasoned perfectly. The salad was fresh and tasty. Smoothies were delicious.  I wish I had tried here before. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. The food is amazing and geared more towards healthy eating. Not completely but just enough. The smoothies are delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the Cajun chicken sandwich and fresh-cut fries for lunch today. Both were amazing. The chicken was tender and spiced just right and the fresh-cut fries were awesome. I love me some fresh-cut fries and they were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I also got a drink and my bill totaled $9.50. That's a sub, chips and drink at Subway for comparison's sake, so I didn't mind the price tag one bit. It's always nice to throw a mom-n-pop shop a little business and I'll be happy to again.

My only knock on the place was the grooves in the table collect some grime and they needed more attention. Dirt in the dining room can raise concerns about the kitchen, but it wasn't real bad so I wasn't too worried. Other than that, it was awesome.

EDIT:
Just a heads up: when you check in here, you're given a $1 coupon from Yelp to use here. They don't accept it and were mystified why it was offered. So, don't be expecting that $1 off anytime soon.

Also, they really need to use table clothes or to reseal the table tops as the grime in the creases is kind of nasty to eat on."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. Definitely a hidden gem worth checking out. Many different options for sandwiches and wraps with healthy options for those of us who care. Amazing what you can find when you are from our of town and lost. Definitely worth the stop."}
{"text":"GOODNESS...
What a hidden gem! I've driven by this location numerous times and never thought to drop in but I sure am I glad I did today!

I ordered online using the yelp EAT app and headed to the North Hills Grill. So convenient. Only word of caution: the EAT app is not most up to date on what delicious items they have to offer.

The establishment is so clean and the lady behind the counter was very nice. She made sure my food to go wouldn't leak or spill by double checking for me. Such attention to detail!

Now to the food...

Wow wow wow. Honestly, I didn't expect such a high quality gourmet salad. (I got the berry salad with blue cheese, grilled chicken and almonds) it was delightful. The berries were fresh and plentiful. Not haphazardly thrown in just for color... A true generous amount. And the dressing tasted homemade and was a perfect blend of sweet, tart and savory. I also got the stuffed pepper soup which was so hearty but not gross-greasy if you know what I mean. Very flavorful. I ate every last morsel. 

Check this place out. It is one of those places where you will see hard working people putting out high quality food with lots of attention and pride."}
{"text":"Really loved this place, all the food was so good and you could tell it was real and made fresh. So sad they closed, I used to go here all the time :("}
{"text":"Huge assortment of healthy, tasty food. Free wifi. Fair prices. Friendly staff. Recommend this for anybody passing through North Hills, or makes a great excuse to go to the area!"}
{"text":"I've been in need of a serious smoothie and sadly I did not feel this place delivered.  I feel like it's trying to provide a healthier food option for lunch but I felt like the menu was small and the items weren't even really healthy.  If you're watching your calories I'd keep searching.

Not very vegan friendly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late(ish) dinner last Tuesday. Loved the casual atmosphere, and obviously freshly made food. My wife had the reuben, and I had the caesar chicken wrap with sweet potato fries. We left full, and happy! It's a great option for those looking for lighter, healthier but tasty fare.  The prices are reasonable, and the service is better than most places in the area.  It's great to see a smaller, local business produce a good product, and I hope they remain in business for years to come!"}
{"text":"North Hills Grill is a gem of a place, with great lighter fare. Everything is freshly made. The quinoa salad is to die for. Staff is friendly and kind. Be aware, this isn't McDonalds, so you'll have to wait a moment for your meal to come out. You won't starve."}
