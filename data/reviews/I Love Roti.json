{"text":"I bought roti and curry from these guys before and found it to be pretty ok. I hadn't gone there in over a year until last Saturday. I was very disappointed to say the least. The curry was tasteless and the potato balls were plain and unseasoned. The must have been a change in cooks or something. The place is called \"I love roti\" so I expected, as before, tasty rotis but it was terrible. Oh well on to another place. What a pity!"}
{"text":"I love this place - has the best roti in all of Pickering. The roti is perfectly layered with crushed lentils in between and the jerk chicken was amazing"}
{"text":"I went there today for lunch and I was very disappointed the was the woman at the counter. I specifically asked for the curry goat with Roti and asked her twice to add extra hot sauce for me as I eat really hot food. I came home looking forward to have a meal as I was so hungry and to my disappointment the food taste really bad. I have eated"}
{"text":"They make the best Curry Chicken Roti that I've ever tasted.  Nice, juicy, perfectly seasoned chicken breast and potatoes.  It is a little drive for me and well worth the trip.  Next time I will take a picture and post if I can hold off from eating it up long enough to get a picture."}
{"text":"Great roti/dhalpourie, they have lunch specials and the doubles are good too. Favourite is the curry goat roti. They also have jerk chicken, beef curry, chicken curry on rice and peas or white rice or roti. Amazing customer service here."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre . I know good tasty Guyanese food . Went in at 11 am  couple seemed to be unhappy ,perhaps  though a bad day outside of work ? Who knows . The huge framed picture  with  Trudeau  with his hands around her and her husband though shows that they do smile for some individuals .  And as they dont have a written menu , it all on the wall and I could not see it  the woman seemed upset she had to help me . Even though I told her I could not see the menu due to my eye sight .  My kids are 5 and 6 and have been trying various foods recently and all the owners we met so far  went out of their way with customer service , Helping to explain foods even to my kids and I .  LOL lucky my kids were not there. Because to help me seemed like a bother, far less kids wanting to be treated as customers as well ,right ?  At that time when I ordered I was the only one in the store . My kids opinion : I recommend Rolands in Pickering or Timerhi's in Scarborough  over this,more selection .Sadly though I think its all comes down to first impressions . And treating every customer the same with the same experience of \"Friendliness is key   MY kids review based on taste alone below http://youtu.be/8FrPR0EOcxY"}
{"text":"I Love Roti is one of those strip-mall hidden gems.  Expect warm and friendly service from the lovely Guyanese woman who also runs the kitchen.  I  stopped at I Love Roti while travelling through the region on a Saturday night.   My friends went to the generic, Chinese mega-buffet next door. Mine was the better choice (and my dinner one quarter the price of the mega buffet).  My curry goat with rice and black beans was excellent.  Reminded me of similar meals I've eaten in simple kitchens in Guyana and elsewhere in the Caribbean.  Tender meat and potatoes were smothered in a sauce that was rich and aromatic.  The curry was not terribly spicy -- probably in deference to Canadian palates -- but you can spice it up in a hurry with the pepper sauce that's on every table.    Prices are amazingly low for the amount of excellent food they serve.  My main dish and drink cost less than eight dollars and I had to take half home with me because the portion was so huge.  The menu has a ton of different choices for curries and rotis, including vegetarian options.  I wish I lived closer.  I Love Roti is yummy."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today when I was randomly doing field work in northern Pickering.   I had the very tender boneless chicken roti, freshly made and smothered in the rich and spicy sauce. My co-worker liked his veggie roti very much, too. Trust me, it was the best part of our day in Durham County.  Cheap and delicious lunch special, cheerful serving lady and cook, smiling, happy customers. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be sure to return."}
{"text":"Great family owned spot I always get a dozen Pholourie it's delicious with their chutney sauce. It's cheap but good which is a rare combination. The only other item I ever really get here is the chicken Roti which is fantastic, always get extra gravy on the side if taking to go."}
{"text":"I looooove I Love Roti!  Been coming here for many years and always get a fantastic meal.  I'm not as close as I used to be, but any time I'm in the area it's a magnetic attraction.  Recently had the doubles for the first time.... where have you been all of my life??  I only discovered doubles more recently, but these are the best I've ever had.  I usually order beef roti.  The roti bread is soft and freshly made, and filled with deliciously seasoned tender beef and lots of gravy.  Excellent value and lunch-size portions earlier in the day."}
{"text":"\"I Love Roti\"? There is little doubt in my mind that the name of this establishment is meant to reflect the attitude of the cook and servers, not the clientele. They most definitely love roti here - and as soon as they pour that lovely bowlful of aromatic gravy over your dhal puri roti - you will understand what I mean by that.  The distinguishing characteristic of I Love Roti's preparation is that the rotis are served \"wet\", with a thin and perfectly spiced gravy cooked tandem with the filling poured over top. If you've ever been disappointing by a dry, bland and crumbly roti and found yourself reaching for the extra pepper sauce and/or a glass of water, you will hardly miss either here. For their impressive size, the rotis are perfectly textured and filled throughout with just the right roti wrap to filling ratio.  My recommendation would be the chicken stew roti, which somewhat eschews traditional Guyanese/Caribbean flavors for a lovely thyme based chicken stew that tastes so comforting and universal, you'll crave it independently of any sudden pangs for roti/Caribbean. It's now competing with Gandhi's roti as a candidate for my last supper."}
{"text":"When I saw a review posted in the main feed last month, I added I Love Roti to my Yelp bookmarks... or as I like to call it, my 'To Do' list. Then, another review came up last week and I thought, why deprive myself any longer?  When we arrived, the restaurant wasn't too busy but there was definitely a steady stream of customers arriving for takeout. We had decided to stay for our meal.  I had the chicken breast with rice and beans and my husband had the lamb with rice and beans. He was hoping for goat but it wasn't unavailable so they were offering lamb as a substitute for the same price. Both meals included a pop and were $7.75 and $7.95 respectively. We also ordered a dozen pholourie which came with an wonderful apple chutney.  First of all I have to say... this was by far, the best pholourie I've ever had! These tasty little bites of happiness were so light and airy I could have easily had the whole dozen all to myself - in fact, next time I think I might! The apple chutney was also delicious and a nice change from the typical mango chutney or tamarind sauce I'm used to having. The chutney had just the right amount of heat to it but if you're someone who's not used to it, I suggest having a cool refreshing drink close at hand just in case.  For my dish, I requested extra gravy only because chicken breast can sometimes be a little dry but I can tell you, that was not the case this time. I was actually surprised at how moist and tender the chicken was. The lamb my husband had was also delicious but let's face it, you can never really go wrong with lamb.  The portions were huge, more than I would have expected for the price and the service was excellent. A solid '3-star, A-OK' for now."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is busy.  great location but food is gritty and Roti's are not that great.  All male truckers eating at this joint.  Man,  i wish they knew about Taste of T&T."}
{"text":"I have been coming to I Love Roti for years, and absolutely love the place.  I nearly always order the same thing, the boneless goat roti lunch special, always with gravy (on the side for to-go orders).  The goat is always tender and the flavour is perfect.  The lunch special roti is a very generous portion and a great deal.  Occasionally, I will order the jerk chicken with rice and beans; the chicken is always moist and falling off the bone delicious, but not particularly spicy.  If you really want to spice up your meal you can add some of the homemade hot sauce, which will just about knock your socks off!  There is always hot sauce at the tables, and you can request some on the side if you're ordering to go.  Staff here are always friendly, and the roti always delicious.    Love it!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Yelp review and was salivating for some Roti.  I ordered the shrimp roti and a diet Coke.  Meal came to just over $10.  Roti came dressed in Curry sauce and was a nice blend of potatoes and shrimp.  Lots of the nice sauce to soak it up!  Mmmmm just the right spice and excellent flavour and value!"}
{"text":"My dad and I couldn't decide what to do for dinner, so we came here after I'd looked at the great reviews below. I've never had roti or curry, so this was an entirely new experience for me.  They have lots of specials and it seems you can get the lunch sized dishes just about anytime. I ordered the goat curry with roti, my dad ordered the jerk chicken with beans and rice and we ordered a chicken stew with roti for my mom to eat later on. All of the meals came with drinks and the total was around $24, not bad for three people to eat dinner!  We didn't eat in, but the restaurant itself was ok, nothing to write home about. There was two people working, the Guyanese woman who was running the kitchen and another younger guy that took care of us at the front. He was really nice and knowledgable and answered the questions that we had about portion size and spicyness (my mom is not into spicy so we wanted something simple and plain for her).  We had to make a few pit stops before we got home, but even after that, our foot was still hot (and we came from across Pickering, two highway interchanges away). Mine was absolutely yummy, the roti was fresh and soft, and I basically didn't need a knife to cut through the goat and potatoes that were inside my roti. I wasn't able to finish all of it even though I was starving and  had the rest of it two days later - dear lord it was even better then! My dad's jerk chicken was good but he does enjoy spice and found that it wasn't hot enough for traditional jerk chicken. But he ate it all up and commented that it was indeed very good. My mom also enjoyed her chicken stew and noted again that the portion size (she got the lunch size) was huge even for her. We got hot sauce on the side with ours, hot enough to blow your head off if you're into that sort of thing.  Overall, I was pretty pleased with how much food we got for the price and how very very good it was. This was definitely a good first-timer experience and I will return to have more of that scrumptious goat curry again!"}
{"text":"Been here many times and always love it. The poulorie is amazing, dipping in the sauce. The roti itself is awesome love coming here and the host is amazing."}
{"text":"Was in the Pickering area around dinner time so might as well grab some food before going home. I remembered passing by a few roti places and decided to drop into this one after seeing decent reviews on yelp.  The service was friendly it wasn't busy when I got there. Looks better than other roti places that I have been to that was like a hole in the wall.   Ordered the goat roti and one of the first things I noticed was the smell. There was a burnt smell to it even though the skin wasn't considered burnt. Bit into the skin and you can taste there is a slight burn taste not sure if it is the residual taste from the previous item on that cookware. Overall the skin (if it wasn't burnt) and the curry were ok and there were plenty of goat in the filling. The disappointing part was the goat. The goat is suppose to be the star of the roti but it was bland. All I can taste was the curry and the skin but lack any taste of the goat."}
