{"text":"This is exactly the kind of place that the downtown Concord area needs! Food was great and different than the typical BBQ and Burger places we have in town. 

Try the Crepes!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this new place out. We love crepes and they did not disappoint here. It's a cute little location. The staff was nice and attentive. Food was great. Lots of savory crepes to chose from and sandwiches too. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Love love love the crepes and the French onion soup!    Looking forward to trying some other dishes next time we come....which will be next week!!"}
{"text":"This find on Yelp is a true culinary gem in Concord. The food and ambiance is great. They even have French background music playing. 

Our waitress, Alex, was very courteous and recommended the crab stuffed mushrooms that were delicious. 

The crêpes were as good as the ones we had in Paris. The quiche aux épinards was also exquisite.  

I would most definitely recommend this place. It's worth the drive and we will most certainly return."}
{"text":"My Cousinsisters and I had a wonderful lunch. The escargot is to die for and the scallops are delicious! The dessert crepes are sweet but very good. Francois, the owner, is such a gentleman and knows how to treat his customers. We are so glad to have found this French gem in the heart of Concord."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great potential!  The dishes were delightfully prepared.  The snails were AMAZING.  The scallops were fresh and perfect.  The sauces for both dishes were spot-on as well.
The ambience is really quite nice, though the first round I sat on was wobbly (and has been since it opened).  
They desperately need to fix their wine list (seriously lacking anything to pair with incredible food, is such a shame).   
Service needs improvement as well.  Perhaps, because I was the only one there and they just didn't care. 
Step it up and this could be a destination place ... like going to a Parisian restaurant, without having to pay for the air fare. 

Sante!

{"text":"A real gem in the heart of downtown Concord. The sweet crêpes make this a dessert destination, and the savory crêpes make it a standout restaurant among a growing set of eateries and pubs that have  revitalized this sleepy city center.  The portions are ample so consider sharing, maybe with a side of spinach quiche.  I've now tried close to 10 items on the menu, and have been pleased with them all.  The Crêpe Citron and Salmon crêpe may be my two favorites.   Props to François and his staff for always being friendly.  So glad to see this addition to our downtown."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch and everything was delicious from the French onion soup, the spinach quiche, to the French dip.  Looking forward to trying their Brunch on Sunday and this place is a welcome addition to downtown Concord."}
