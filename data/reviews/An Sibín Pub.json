{"text":"I really enjoy stopping in for a pint or two. Kelly is awesome. Just a great place to chill out and the staff is always nice. I have eaten a couple of things off the menu, my fav is the eggplant parmesan sandwich. I know, I know, eggplant parm at an Irish pub? But it works, it really does. Especially after a few pints! :)"}
{"text":"Dishonest & deceptive Craft Beers  I wanted to like this pub but could not due to their dishonest list of Craft beers they have. It made me think if they are dishonest about this, what else they might be dishonest about.  Look at the attached picture and you will see they serve Craft Lagers and Ales:  Rolling Rock Goose Island Both of these are owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev, www.ab-inbev.com .  Creemore Springs Brewery Limited is owned by Molson Coors Brewing Company.  This is deceptive marketing to trick people into thinking they are drinking a \"Micro\" brew but they are not.  One definition of An Sibín Pub is a shady bar. I will add unethical to this definition and will not be returning."}
{"text":"We ordered cheeseburgers and they came without cheese. They just put on cheese and returned same burgers/plates to table which everything on the late was then cold. To top it off - they overcharged for the Bloody Caesar - menu and board outside said $4 - they charged us $5. Would not recommend at all. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Pretty average. Fine if you live in the neighbourhood and want some pub fare. Not worth travelling for. Staff is polite."}
{"text":"Pretty decent beer selections from Canada and Ireland, ciders as well. I tried a Sherwick (I think that's what it was a called), and it was the best of the other ones (it wasn't as heavy).   I ordered the Shepards pie which was delicious (aside from needed a bit of spice). There was a ton of lamb meat (my first time trying lamb) which was soft. The mashed potatoes were creamy. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  Go on a Friday night, they have different bands who are always amazing! (And really fun to dance to after a couple of drinks).  The service has always been amazing. They take reservations for large parties on busy days at peak times, which is great.  They have a good selection of beers, always fun to try new ones, and the food is pretty good... Although we've usually stuck to appetizers so we can share something to nibble on while we have a drink.  The service is amazing, and the staff is so friendly! A great pub to go to when you don't feel like going all the way downtown of a Friday or Saturday night!"}
{"text":"Good place to catch the game. Tons of TVs and good drinks to select from.  Food was surprisingly decent, tried the fish and chips which is a good size. The other people in my party got the Fried Chicken sandwich, Pulled pork sandwich and I believe it was the daily special. Not sure what it was thou.  Place was spacious but lack waitress.  Only 2 in the whole place and it was more than half full.  So service was slower than expected but our wait staff was friendly and patience."}
{"text":"I liked An Sibin as soon as I arrived. The layout is interesting with the loft overlooking the floor below as well as the stage. Even though we left before the band started playing, the atmosphere was starting to peak as drinks flowed and the music helped people feel good. The food is standard pub snacks served quickly without any pretension which hit the spot. The beer is good and cold and the view out the window facing Broadview show how this area of Queen St. east is starting to fill out nicely with restaurants and bars like it deserves. An Sibin is a bar worth a trip to seek out, and maybe even help introduce you to a surprisingly cool and fun neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Tried the food here recently and it was really really good. Had a Bacon, cheddar and fries sandwich (fries right in the bun). What could be bad?"}
{"text":"Ahhh, the Shebeen.   I've now been back several times for some late night drinks. Drink of choice is usually various ciders. Yum.   On Saturday nights they have lively, jiggy, happy, familiar live music playing. It's usually tunes you know, with maybe a fiddle thrown in the mix to jig it up a bit. Makes ya wanna tap your toe and order another round.  They do have a late night menu too, in case you get a wee bit peckish. Mmm.... curry fries. (And just in case you miss the kitchen and it closes on ya, there's a pizza pizza 1 block west on Queen.)"}
{"text":"Staff have always been kind and courteous when we have gone in for drinks. Hope you guys get your patio up and running for the warm weather!"}
{"text":"Judging from the crowds, this place is a hit.  But I wasn't really impressed.  Sweet potato fries were raw inside, and the grease tasted old and spent.  Irish corn dog was novel, but uninteresting.  The Irish stew came in a giant serving and looked delicious.  I never got to try it but the woman who did order it stopped eating after only a few mouthfuls.  The place has a very high ceiling which seems wrong for an irish pub.  A loft sits a good 25ft above the main floor.  The differences in height might explain why they seemed to be having a hard time with temperature control.  Fans were whizzing at high speeds and the night air was blowing in through windows at a freakish gale force.  This made the place quite cold and uninviting.  Overall the atmosphere says \"frosh week hot spot\" which seems wrong for the neighbourhood.  Servers were challenged to keep up with the demand for service and our glasses went dry a few times, but the servers were all lovely and even though it was hard to catch their eye, their cleavage made the wait more bearable.    I'll be back for the Guinness at some point, but it will a long time  before I try eating here again.  Update: Based on feedback from the owner, here are a few corrections to this review:  1) The loft is 15' high; and, 2) There is only one ceiling fan.  Also, I've been informed that the heating system is working better now."}
{"text":"The Sibin is one of the best locals in the city.  Pop in for a pint or 3 with large groups, small groups, or even alone. The menu is great as is the food.  The owners and staff get involved in this great little neighbourhood of Riverside (NOT Riverdale, thanks Yelp).  A local pub is where you can go for great ambience, great music, great service, good quality food and a large selection of beverages. The Sibin has all of the above."}
{"text":"Dropped by An Sibin during a pub crawl. Appeared to be a lovely irish pub.  I didn't eat anything, but they do have a pretty good beer selection.  Pretty empty on a Saturday afternoon, but I imagine it gets lively late at night."}
{"text":"I went to this pub for the first time recently.  Having never gone to The Real Jerk, I can't compare the two, but I do have some notes.  Right off the bat, I'll admit I didn't eat anything.  I avoid gluten and dairy, and everything had one or the other, or a combination of the two.  But I did enjoy some drinks with friends, and the food they had looked (and smelled) legitimately good.  However, this pub is damn cold.  Like, we're talking keep-your-jacket-on-because-it's-warmer-outside cold.  I don't know why this is, but all I know is that I spent two hours shivering.  I appreciate that they've chosen and are sticking to a celtic theme. That being said, the washroom signs are wicked confusing.  They have \"Mna\" and \"Fir\".  Needless to say, there were many gentlemen using the \"Mna\" washroom, despite the fact that it was the ladies room.  Granted, there was the world's tiniest drawing of a lady on the door, but I think this needs to clearer.  It is a pub, and not everyone has eagle-eye vision after a couple pints and I know I personally don't feel comfortable encountering men in the ladies room.  Service could be a little faster.  It was relatively busy for a Wednesday night, but I felt there was a lot of waiting, especially when it came time to pay.  All in all, I'd visit again if my friends were going, but it's not going to be a priority stop for me personally any time soon.  UPDATE: One of the owners wrote me a letter to address some of the issues.  Apparently the heat is working now, and they are going to address the washroom sign issue.  As well, there are apparently gluten-free menu items (and are marked on the menu), though I admit they weren't super clear the first time I came in.  However, I will take his word for it, and bump my review from two to three stars until I get a chance to come in and try it again."}
{"text":"our group gave it 2 stars...but only because we liked the waitresses accent. at this rate i can't see how this pub will ever replace the irie island cuisine and vibe of the real jerk."}
{"text":"We've been back to this place on other occasions and each time the service has top notch. The food is delicious, try the fish and chips or the shepherds pie, love them both. It's always a great time at the Sibin."}
{"text":"Was in the neighbourhood on a Friday at lunch hour and thought we'd give this a try.  Kitty-corner from Jilly's (strip club) the location is a bit of a question mark, but it's on a decent stretch (at least during the daytime) of Queen, with streetcar access, right on the intersection with Broadview.  Interior is standard pub style, they seemed to have an upstairs area too but we opted to sit by the window.  Not many patrons at lunch hour.  Perhaps at night when the strip club patrons come over they get more?  Hmm.. suddenly feeling like I should've washed my hands before leaving..  Food: - Soup of the day was mussel soup - very nice actually, a smallish portion but the flavour was pleasant, not overly seafoody, and the mussels although small were nice and tender.  4/5. - Side of dense bread - I'm forgetting already what type of bread this was, but got it with the soup and it was pretty standard, though good for dipping in the soup. Also good with just butter (though the butter was hard - note to restaurant - leave butter at room temp!).  3/5 - Wings with fries - fries were great, but wings?  Nope.  Overcooked, and not much meat..  The dip they provided was nice, but the wings themselves were a let-down.  4/5 for fries, 1/5 for wings.  Service was prompt, friendly - no issues.  Overall an 'ok' experience.  Soup was decent, bread was ok, wings were a let-down.  I wasn't my usual careful-self about checking what foods were recommended here, so partially my fault - but then I suppose we should rate a restaurant on more than just it's best foods to get a good picture.  In our case, it was a spontaneous decision to eat here, so we didn't have the luxury of reading up on reviews prior to coming in."}
{"text":"For me, a quick, first-impression lunch left the place wanting.  Yes, the beer selection is a Disneyland, and I'd definitely return for pints upon pints.  But my reuben (the first I've had in years and was eager to enjoy) was a total letdown, despite my server praising its virtues to me. Look... if I can finish a sandwich in four bites, if it's as thin as a small paperback novel, if the so-called sidedish (and mostly overcooked) fries take three times the space on the plate as the main... dude, something is seriously wrong.  I don't expect to leave from a meal still hungry, and I don't my expect my $10 sandwich to be an hors d'oeuvre.   Two stars is generous."}
{"text":"After a painful legal battle with the building's owner, out went longtime neighbourhood icon The Real Jerk, and in came An Sibin Pub, an Irish pub that has quickly become a popular neighbourhood hangout.  There are a crazy selection of beers. When there's an event or big game going on here (traditional musical nights is popular) this place is definitely a-rocking. Otherwise, it's not much of an atmosphere in the ridiculously large space. Nothing I presume, a couple of pints cannot solve--$5 for many drinks between 4 and 7 pm.  {TTC: 501/502/503/504 streetcar to Queen and Broadview. South-east corner. If you find yourself hanging out with riff-raffs and watching strippers doing their thing, yeah, you're definitely at the wrong corner of this intersection.}"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on Friday night.  It was ok, they had a pretty substantial snack menu.  I had a bailey's irish cream coffee which was delish.  My companions had guiness and wine.  I miss the Real Jerk though."}
{"text":"This was a perfect pub experience! I had never been and was looking for somewhere casual to take a family friend to dinner and a quick beer. We arrived early at around 5:30pm and it was Happy Hour. House wine was only $5 a glass and pints between $5-6. Amazing prices. Having a health nut with me and a myself having a number of dietary restrictions I ordered the Large Green Salad, and she the Large Arugula Salad. Both were delicious! They were so fresh and portions were great.  Our family friend ordered the Bangers & Mash and ate every bite. He also ordered a side of the Irish Soda Bread (which comes toasted with butter).  We had amazing service from our Server who was attentive and extremely friendly.  Thanks for a great experience! I'll definitely be back for another happy hour soon."}
{"text":"Spent a leisurely Sunday afternoon in the company of some old friends who live in the neighborhood.  They wanted to check out the \"new Irish pub that took over from the Real Jerk\".  I think that's how I described in to my cab driver coming in.  At least folks won't have a problem finding it...  Here's what worked- menu was interesting and uncluttered with wings and nachos, as the server was quick to point out.  The Butter Chicken Naan quesadilla was interesting, and the fries were fresh cut.  Everything at the table looked and smelled great; no complaints from me mates.  Beer selection wasn't bad, but I thought could have leaned more Irish, or perhaps had a Cask offering.  The servers while friendly, seemed more interested in their smoke break than prompt service.  On a couple of occasions, the smell of cigarettes from two of the three servers (why three servers in a 90 minute sitting?) was a bit gross... but they were friendly.  There was a musical accompaniment that was nice, three fiddles and a guitar.  Had an authentic Céilidh feel to it.  And I really liked the fact there were kids at the pub.  This is a good thing, food, laughs, drink and music, and young ones dancing.  Very cool.  What confused the vibe were the three TV screens.  They were showing football, which was great (I like football), but not really meshing with the vibe of an Irish pub.  Also, saw the note from another reviewer about the lack of heat- well that has been addressed, but don't take the booth by the door, the wood benches were built over the radiator, and my friends both complained of \"sweaty bum\".  LOL.  Next time back in Leslieville, I will stop in again and sample more of the food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night, food was disappointing. Going in expecting just some good old pub food, everything was a bit of a let down. The curry was spicy, but the flavour wasn't great. Tasted just like curry powder, and not much else. Disappointing! Especially for $15. My friends burger was dry and almost burnt. Overall, probably wouldn't come back here to eat, but as a pub its fine."}
{"text":"Pubs are aplenty in this area, with fancier bars and themed saloons up and down the street from this location. However, we were drawn by the cozy but slightly kitschy interior and the promise of Thirsty Thursdays. Tall boys, house wine and premium spirits are all $5! The service is fat and friendly, whipping around constantly but can be flagged down easily if you need anything. I had the fish and chips which came with a large piece of dense haddock filet, fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce. I didn't like the fries since half of them were on the limp and sad side, but the fish was solid with a good batter. In all, a good place to grab a drink and watch a game on the multiple flat screens... but don't expect to be blown away by the food."}
{"text":"Popped in last night for a pint and quick dinner. Not sure about the other food, but the special of Bison pie was INCREDIBLE. The bison was tender and packed with flavour, the veggies were hearty and plentiful and the crust was devine.  The drink selection was good and fairly priced, and they had a great live band that people really seemed to be getting into (dancing and the like).  Good food, decent service, and a great atmosphere. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"LOVE the An Sibin. It has become my Toronto \"Hurley's\"   Food has been great every time, including this visit.  Even though it's 245pm on a lazy Wednesday afternoon the vibe is great, with a classic mix of rock and more traditional Irish tunes.  The Guinness is good and cold, and the beer selection is good enough for the craft beer lover in me.  The party nights I've been here are an absolute blast. The live music has ALWAYS been fantastic.  Great spot!"}
{"text":"Bah!! Two thumbs down!   There is nothing actually wrong with this place. It draws a crowd, it's family friendly, the food is decent and prices are inline with similar places - it's an Irish pub, so it is what it is. What I don't like is that they took a big space, painted it boring colours and did very little to make it unique. It might as well still be the real jerk Jamaican restaurant with different colours. I hate missed opportunities like this."}
{"text":"Came here for a little birthday celebration this year and was able to secure a great table in the balcony. This provided a great view of the band and perfect people-watching conditions. The vibe was cozy, but not overcrowded. The band played lots of \"oldies but goodies\" with some mainstream songs thrown in.   There are plenty of food options, but my friends and I decided to share a bunch of appys. The pigs in a blanket and smoked salmon were the two biggest crowd pleasers. Pigs in a blanket, who wouldn't love sausage wrapped in pastry? I'm not sure if I want to meet this person if they exist. There's a wonderful corn and tomato relish that comes with them that adds a freshness to the pastries and some needed moisture. Better than dipping in ketchup! The smoked salmon was layered on to pieces of toast and drizzled with balsamic reduction. Yum! I wish I had some right now!"}
{"text":"It is my local. Nowhere I'd rather be. A great place with fun staff,  good prices where I feel comfortable.  Food is surprisingly tasty and rotating taps make it a treat. Maybe the best wing dipping sauce around."}
{"text":"Mehhhhh. I dont know, i wasn't a big fan of the Real Jerk to begin with, so i don't really have an attachment to the building. I think they have done a great job renovating it, Jerk was looking pretty tired, and the food was awful.  Drink selection is pretty good, but I wasn't really happy with the food. It is typical pub sorta food, with an obvious tilt towards Irish/English fare. I had the steak and chips, wasn't a big fan of the whiskey/peppercorn sauce that came with it. The serving was a good size though, and staff was quick to refill my Harp."}
{"text":"VIBE Gentrification is inevitable but I can't say I was at the old Real Jerk all of the time, so I don't know if it's fair to complain. I think i'm just nostalgic for a bit of Leslieville past which The Real Jerk represented.   The first thing I noticed was a smell when I came in. Not sure if they're trying to wash away that jerk chicken smell with Guinness. I guess it's working?   On a weekend night, it's also INCREDIBLY loud with the live music. The live music and people dancing adds to the good times vibe but good luck if you're trying to have a conversation nearby.   THE GOODS Lots of different beers on draft. My new trusty drink is no longer Heineken (I know, I know. Head in shame) but it's Blanche de Chambly. Two Blanches and a gin and toinc added to $20.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  It's a nice place to hang out with friends but not being able to remember the pub's name is not helping! I think I like smaller places so I'd probably to go to Prohibition, Riverside or Roy's in the area. There are a lot of options now!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day with co-workers (we actually had planned on going to Dangerous Dan's across the street, but it was closed). It's a typical Irish pub, spacious inside with lots of TV's. The menu wasn't huge but they did have a nice selection of food, you could definitely find something interesting. I wound up getting the Dublin burger, 8oz with cheese and bacon on a nice soft bun. The burger was almost like a baseball, it was massive! Usually big burgers like that have a tendency to be dry and gross but this burger was not at all. It was very good and I enjoyed every bite. They had great fries as well, I like to call them \"vinegar fries\" since they are the kind that taste the best with some Malt vinegar.  Since we were there for a work lunch, we didn't really pay attention to the huge selection of beers - but the beer menu was bigger than the food one! My coworkers got the daily special which was a pork roast sandwich with mushrooms and they all loved it. All in all, not a bad substitute for our original destination. I still want to try Dan's though.... :)"}
{"text":"I guess this is my local, so I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before now. This place ain't fancy, but it fits the bill if you are popping in for a pint. I usually have a Foundry cider which is on tap. I have only eaten here once and it was on a Monday night for their wing special. I think it was $6 for a pound of wings which I thought was good value, and most importantly, the wings were tasty. The atmosphere is laid back unless there is a live act which can get a little busy and loud though it is still a preety decent venue."}
{"text":"Happy to see a bit of Irish in the east end. Lovely service. Standard pub food. I wish I could say more but it really didn't stand out in my mind."}
