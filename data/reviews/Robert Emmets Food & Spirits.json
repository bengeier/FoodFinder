{"text":"Super cool \"watering hole\". The bartenders and cooks are the Greatest! Coldest beer in town, friendliest staff. The food is Awesome! They have darts,Pool tournaments, karaoke, and a huge smoking patio with TV's and heaters in winter and misters in summer. The Greatest bartender in the valley works there and her birthday party is Saturday night the 9th of January. Come wish Audra Renee Anderson Happy Birthday."}
{"text":"super dope locus come spend you money here you wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great place!  Love the dive bar atmosphere.  The bartender Tanya was super nice!  The food was really good and the draft beer was good and cold.  Definitely going to visit again.  Has two pool tables and two dart boards if you need something to entertain you.  GREAT PLACE!"}
{"text":"Very awesome place! Nice people and they make your drinks just right. Come on by you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough that I LOVE this bar.  The food is amazing, the wings are a def item to get, cripsy enough skin and juice well cooked meat inside with bomb ass sauce.

The bartenders are extremely friendly, love return customers, and can make you an amazing cocktail that will get ya going, I recommend the Jungle Juice!

Then we have Karaoke and Trivia hosts who are let me say the bomb dot com.  They are friendly, exciting, want to involve everyone and make sure everyone enjoys themselves!

It may be considered a dive bar, but it's fun, relaxed, the patrons are so friendly and plenty of people to meet n greet that you just have fun with it.  It's my bar."}
{"text":"A complete blast to hang out in! The cheese burgers that come out of this kitchen are huge and delicious and the bartenders are always friendly! LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This is DEFINITELY a bar - not a restaurant.  I wish I'd read the small print a bit better before hauling my family there on a Friday for happy hour.  Was definitely dark and we were a bit put off by being pounced upon immediately for fundraising raffle (before our drink order); though I will say kudos, the waitress came by right away with a big smile ready to please.  I would definitely go back here, but make no mistake, it is DEFINITELY a dive, but looks like a FUN one, and I am looking forward to trying the food... 

Almost forgot - there was MINIMAL seating left by the time we arrived, a Friday at appx 5ish.  Two round tables with four chairs a piece and then TWO HUGE TABLES were reserved for some private party.  So.. we'd have to sit at the bar which my senior citizen mother was not going to be doing."}
{"text":"Oh man, i used to go here fairly often years ago. I went there this Friday and had a blast. Jen, our waitress was friendly and got our drink and food orders quickly. She also kept tabs on us, made sure our experience was fun and made us feel well taken care of.

The patrons seem working class, a very friendly group. We had Karaoke that night. Great song variety.

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ok, so I chose this place because I needed a place in Glendale to be my 'usual stop' if I have to be here a while.. but I have a feeling Robert Emmet will not become it.

I have nothing bad to say about this place, but for being an \"Irish\" joint (and the \"Irish\" should be said very loosely) they have nothing 'not domestic' on tap. Budweiser and cheese burger may please the masses, but then the image might be stretched thin.

However, this been said its a friendly crowd and I am drinking my sulk beer in peace. And I am here early, so this place have potential.. I just don't see it. But considering I was looking for a dive, this isn't bad.

.. und das ist nach der Kritiker"}
{"text":"You have to be a regular here to feel welcome. If not you feel like kind of an outcast. Food good. Atmosphere questionable. Bartenders are very kind but take a lot of smoke breaks. Asked for our bill and bartender came back with a vocal price, no ring up just a vocal with what we owed, then disappeared for 15 minutes and we had to ask the other to ring us up. Nevertheless, kind and good hearted. Left feeling sorry for this place and hopeful for the patrons and their futures because the expressions looked bleak and melancholy; plus the bar, floors, and beer trough look like they could use a good scrubdown with bleach and hot water. Wish you the best but this veteran traveler won't be looking back."}
{"text":"Seriously!!! When I Came into this place I thought it was kind of cool we sat down at the bar. I ordered a gray goose on the rocks which was in such a tiny little glass and then a Guinness i then asked the bartender to make my two friends whatever he wanted. After that I had another Guinness 5 shots of apple pucker one shot of Patron and one Jäger along with three shots of water.  That was it. I asked for my bill it took FOREVER!  Then when I finally received my bill it was $146.00. How is this possible?  The bartender then got pissy with me. I serve and bartend and never have I tried to rip off a guest. I wasn't drunk. As a matter of fact me and my 2 friends drank those three shots of water. Which was supposed to be a pretend shot. I guess the other two shots were for the owners. Some girl and some guy.  Anyway I asked the bartender how much a shot a Jäger was. He said $4.50.  So how is my bill $146.00.  He combined a tab with some other guy that we met there. Unapologetic or anything my bill ended up being $50.00. In the future I will NEVER BE BACK.  And anyone new who comes in and try's a new bar, watch out!  Their are thief's among you.  You might pay $19 for a Guinness and $15 for a shot of water!"}
{"text":"stopped in during a visit to arizona. my boyfriend had an interview for a graduate program at a nearby school. I would love an opportunity to work here - as he was JUST accepted into the program!!!"}
{"text":"Nice size little divey bar near downtown Glendale. Very casual place; pool tables, poker games some nights, greasy bar food and affordable drinks. They have a patio too for smokers."}
{"text":"We were looking for happy hour to hit up before a concert at the Pavilion...... which there is very little out there, any suggestions?

Anyway this is how I scored them 3 stars.

1st off their website said they have Happy Hour on Saturdays.  They do not, only during the week. -  loose 1 star.

2nd Bad services. Once we received our drinks it took forever to get a sever to come back. - loose 1 star.

3rd My whiskey sour was all sour and the same with my friend's vodka soda, all soda..   - loose 1 star,

We ordered burgers and they were very good. - plus 1 star.

All and all this place is a dive with cheap prices. I would come back here for beer and burgers. The crowd is something i'd expect for the location. I wouldn't want to walk out to my car alone at closing time."}
{"text":"I call this a \"dive bar.\" But really is my neighborhood bar. Not as divey as one would expect with this label. It is clean, nice, and the people rock! They love their loyal customers and treat them well. You will find me there with fellow west valley Twitter folk on Friday and Saturday's tossing back a pitcher of cheap beer and top shelf whiskey."}
{"text":"As Historic Downtown Glendale begins a slow ascent to west valley relevancy, it needs a nearby watering hole where thirsty patrons can party til 2am.

Robert Emmets could be that place.

This old dive has been around longer than I have, and it's shown by camaraderie of their silvering clientele shooting pool with the influx of young, attractive patrons. When my friend and I walked in, we were greeted by both the bartenders, and tons of the customers. It's a warm, inviting atmosphere dedicated to fun!

On the inside: Pool tables, a large bar, and a few TVs. Vintage Budweiser gear adds a nice charm. Bartenders (Jenny & Jim, I think?) were not just a pleasure to be served by, but they can hop on the mic and sing some mean karaoke. 

The patio is where this place really shines. In the summer, it's cooled with a perpetual shroud of mist, so that I can get some fresh air without burning up. This is where the sports watching happens at high volume. It's fully enclosed in a giant gate, which adds to a feel of exclusivity. 

Some of you might be a little skeptical of the location, but I have to point out...they probably couldn't afford some of the homes lined with palm trees just a stone's throw north. Venture out of the usual strip-mall part of Glendale, and get in on this up-and-coming part of town."}
{"text":"Went to @robertemmetsaz with @mikescott8 and @dsrthoney. My second time there.

Nice place. Has a good neighborhood kinda feel to it I appreciate.

Had some food this time, prepared by the wonderful Danny, who tears it up in the little kitchen.

I had a burger that was supposed to be pretty hot, and had him add bacon, then I put some Tabasco on for good measure.
(I like my burgers to make me sweat)

Let me tell you, that was hands down one of the best burgers I've had in my life. The patty was huge, and the cook time was perfect. (They never even asked how I wanted it)
I mowed through it so fast I think people wondered if I tasted it at all.

The fries were pretty good, too. But the nachos, those were awesome. I only had a few, but delicious!

It was a Wednesday night, and they were doing trivia. Their trivia night has an advantage over many other places; you can win real prizes.

First prize gets a $25 gift card to Robert Emmet's. Second prize gets a free pitcher of beer.

You have to have at least 2 players on your team. The questions were pretty tough, and I don't think I'd have won.

The dude running trivia is kinda loud, so if that bothers you, skip Wed. night.

Otherwise, get thee to Robert Emmet's post-haste, and enjoy thyself! And if you see Bobby or Lea, tell 'em Vern sent you."}
{"text":"Great bar go to if you want to chill and have great memories . I'm from a small town named Yuma this place bring very good memories. The staff is great I hear the food is great too . If you looking for a chill place this is the bar for you ."}
{"text":"The hot wings were good and our server made good drinks, but the bartender made horribly weak drinks and was a dick about it when the drink was sent back. he said \"there's a full shot in there, if she wants more she can pay for it\" I'm not sure if my friend being the only black person in the place has anything to do with it but the bartender treated me ( a pretty, white, blue eyed female) differently. On top of all of that a small was cranberry vodka was $9!!!!"}
