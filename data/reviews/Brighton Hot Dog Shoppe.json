{"text":"I was really excited about this place because I love diners and mom and pop shops. We grabbed a seat, and I ordered cheese fries (yum! oh wow) and my friend ordered a cheeseburger and chili fries.  The waitress was very nice, but she wasn't very knowledgable with the very simple menu and somehow managed to mess up our order. My friend asked for chili fries, and they came out sans chili. He also asked if the toppings on the burger would cost extra. She said \"Um, I don't know sorry,\" and then stood there and waited for us to order, not asking or checking or anything. I said \"they're free... it says it right on the menu...\" Super weird!  But it totally has its charm, and getting an order of fries wrong somehow seems to compliment the charm of a quaint hot dog diner. The owner or manager at the check out was super friendly, and they let us put the tiny bill on a card without complaints. I'd still totally come here again, especially with those great prices!"}
{"text":"My wife brought dinner home from the Brighten Hot Dog Shop.  She ordered 2 double cheese burgers with bacon,  lettuce,  and tomatoes. When she returned with the food my double cheese burgers were plain so we called and spoke with whomever was in charge. The manager on the phone said that the burgers would be corrected and that I could come back with the incorrect food. I left my family to pick up the corrected food. When I arrived in the drive-thru I explained  who I was and what needed to happen. The employee  went to the manager and mentioned why I was there and handed her the container with the cold plain double cheeseburgers. The employee chuckled to the manager before returning with what I thought was the new (fresh) double cheeseburgers. When the associate handed the food back she said the corrected cheeseburgers were in the second container. I said thank you and pulled off. When I arrived back to my family 5 minutes away and opened the containers the same cold double cheeseburgers were in the container.  In the second container was the missing toppings from the initial order that we paid for.  I called the Brighten Hot Dog Shoppe immediately  to speak with the manager about the cold food that was given back to me.  The associate on the phone said there was no manager working and no one was in charge.  I said fine but giving someone cold food and condiments is not the correct way to make it right. My wife is a General Manager of a restaurant  chain and even commented that she would have made it right by producing fresh and hot food not give the condiments in a second container with the cold burgers...  I have rarely been treated this way by local food establishments in Pittsburgh but felt the need to leave this detailed review in hopes that corporate or franchise management will read and correct this type of behavior. Next time my family of 6 will take the business elsewhere.  This was a $50 profit for the Hot Dog Shoppe now lost in the future."}
{"text":"Consistently great cooked to order burgers and fresh cut fries. Clean. Owners are great; friendly truly devoted and on site. Prices spot on"}
{"text":"Come on, 4 hot dogs, a large French fry and two drinks for $10?! What else can you ask for?  Old school diner feel (reminds me of Coney Island back home) with steamed straight from the bag rolls, simple toppings, and shoe string fries.   No fancy gourmet things here and absolutely delicious.   Just a note, when they ran my credit card they didn't have an entry for a tip for my waitress. So make sure you have a couple of bucks if you plan on paying with a card."}
{"text":"This is my kind of place. The people there are incredibly nice, the food is delicious, the coffee is hot and made to perfection, they serve breakfast and dinner and the prices are as low as I have seen...anywhere (including fast food joints). What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place has saved me hundreds, nay, thousands of dollars.  Let me explain.  When being sent grocery shopping to the local Iggle by my wife, I always stop off here for a few cheese dogs, and maybe some fries.  Instead of impulse buying in the grocery store, Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe fills me up, and I stick to the list!"}
{"text":"Wow. The burgers are so cheap but the quality of the meat is on par with 5 Guys burgers. I feel kind of crazy saying that but it's true. The only difference is that 5 guys offers a thicker patty and more toppings for 3x the price...  Definitely recommend this place. I want to literally drive back and get another burger. They also offer hot dogs and milk shakes... nah imma get the burger again. You can't that taste for $3."}
{"text":"Great burgers, fresh cut fries, family owned establishment. this is a wonderful place and a great alternative to McDonald's. The prices are good and I love the food here."}
{"text":"I love BHDS to an extreme degree. Upon transferring to my new job in Moon, my coworkers warned me about getting addicted to this food. I'm here at least 3x a week because it is affordable and satisfying.   I typically get a dog with chili and onions and and a kraut dog. Everything from the weenie to the bun to the toppings coalesces into a savory bite each time you dig in. The French fries are prepared fresh, as soon as you order they throw a new batch into the deep fry.  There is also a tray with salt and pepper, vinegar, crushed red pepper, and my favorite: Frank's hot sauce. Everything you could want out of a hot dog place lies within BHDS."}
{"text":"Great little shop seems family owned, very nice people. Food is great for a hot dog the chili dogs are where it's at.  Only complaint is the weak generic ketchup, come on its Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Roll up, roll up for the Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe experience! There are quite a few locations to choose from, but the one on Noblestown Road is my regular stop. Now, if you know Pittsburgh, you know its residents have a love for the hot dog. All sorts of hot dog eateries have come and gone, but Brighton Hot Dogs (as I like to refer to them) has been a mainstay, and rightly so.  The hot dogs have their own unique taste, and that's key to any successful hot dog joint. Hot dogs you get at restaurants shouldn't remind you of ones you can make at home. To me, they should be better than that. When I think of great hot dogs, I think of cheese Coneys from Skyline in Cincinnati, or Yocco's hot dogs with their funky chili sauce out in Allentown, PA. Brighton fits this bill as well. The flavor of the hot dogs they use is unique on its own. They certainly don't taste like any of the supermarket majors I've had, which is a plus.  Like Yocco's, Brighton Hot Dogs' chili is a thinner type of chili sauce than a full-blown meat and beans type of chili. It's there to complement the hot dog, not overwhelm it. The consistency is spot on. Add some mustard to it and you have one terrific chili dog. I usually get a pair of them.  The hamburgers are also good. Now, these remind me of the types of burgers I would grill up myself, and that's just fine. It's a basic burger and you can get whatever myriad toppings you'd like on it. I usually just go for mustard and ketchup and some lettuce. It's not a huge gourmet burger, but it's tons better than anything McDonald's or Wendy's are serving just up the street. The homemade taste is what counts.  Of course, it wouldn't be a Pittsburgh eatery if there weren't fresh cut fries. Lo and behold, Brighton has those, too. It's funny, when I moved from Pittsburgh for a few years, the one thing I seriously missed was fresh cut fries everywhere. You just start to take them for granted after a while. And when you move to a place where everyone uses frozen fries mainly, you really start missing them. Anyway, Brighton's fries are tasty and as often is the case around here, go great with some vinegar on top.  I've also enjoyed the breakfast here, and this place definitely gets crowded on weekend mornings. Heck, you can't beat the prices for all the food you get. The pancakes are awesome, as are the eggs and sausage. It's a basic breakfast menu and it satisfies greatly. Brighton Hot Dogs is really about getting good food at a sweet price to its customers and not about bells and whistles and all the sort of things that jack up the price of a meal for no real reason.  One of my favorite things at this location is the wacky drive thru speaker box they have inside the restaurant. It looks like some sort of relic and always seems to be turned up to 11. It adds to the low key and charming atmosphere.  The staff is always super friendly and the food is always served at a decent pace. The prices are perfect (the combo number one is two hot dogs or a hamburger however you like plus fries and a drink for six bucks) and the food is really good. So if you like hot dogs or groovy breakfasts at a nifty price, Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe is the place for you. Sometimes the classics need not be improved upon."}
{"text":"My wife and I walked in one day, and asked if they could make a Chicago-style hotdog.  No one knew what we were talking about.  Makes sense, though.  None of them were from Chicago.  Man, are those hotdogs good!  I'm sure they make good dogs.  Maybe think about hiring someone from Chicago to make them."}
{"text":"Pretty average place.  Disappointed that they weren't casing franks.  Surprised a hot dog place would serve a generic hot dog.  The chili was pretty flavorless and the onions were almost ground rather than chopped.  The only thing that got them to three stars were the fresh cut fries."}
{"text":"Good hotdogs & fries. Very consistent. Always get it with the cheese sauce. Clean little shop."}
{"text":"Affordable and delicious.  Pretty much the same as all of the other Brighton Hot Dog Shoppes around here.  Maybe a little cleaner than the other locations.  Not that that says a whole lot."}
{"text":"Classic grilled dogs on steamed buns.Hit the spot. I want to come back and try the breakfast. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent dogs and burgers. And all u can eat ffs. And  very reasonable price will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The hot dogs here are consistently good, and so are the french fries.  I do wonder that they don't offer anything a little more upscale or gourmet.  It's your basic ballpark hot dog with chili, cheese and/or onions.  If you compare it to Station Street, then you notice that the food here is lacking anything creative or special.  But over the years, this shop provides a clean space with a hot dog that time forgot."}
{"text":"Cute little shop, and the hot dogs taste great (although to be honest hot dogs aren't exactly easy to screw up). Still these hot dogs were pretty excellent, the condiments were fresh and the fries tasted good too. Also the prices are definitely on the affordable side. Great experience all around!"}
{"text":"Service is bad.  I ordered a large chili and cashier rang it up large chili fry.  I told her I just want a large chili.  She said ok.  My order came up and it was a large chili fry.  I told the cook and she said that's what you ordered.  What is so complicated????"}
{"text":"Love coming here when we visit Pittsburgh. The food is very tasty for the price point. Where else can you get six hotdogs, a cheeseburger, French fries, and a drink for less than $16. If I were local I'd eat lunch here a lot!"}
{"text":"since im from New Brighton (home of HDS) I was the happiest girl alive when I heard of one in Pittsburgh, since I call Pgh home now. The food is amazing, absolutely  amazing! My mom said that while pregnant with me she lived off of HDS so I think that's why I'm a little addicted :)"}
{"text":"So the best part about this place is definitely the Prices. If you're looking for a cheap quick meal and are tired of the typical fast food joints, the hot dog shoppe is worth a try, but don't expect to be amazed. Nothing on the menu really jumps out. I like the wedding soup, but it's probably canned, hot dogs are hard to screw up, and the burgers are reminiscent of a school cafeteria lunch item. The only thing that I really don't like on their menu is the cheese sauce, canned and sits in a hot pot all day.  Overall, a decent value, but not a life changing experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. Cheap and good food.   I have a family of 7 and eat for around $30-$35."}
{"text":"Still lovin' Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe. This one is as good as all the others. A chili dog and some fries from here always put me in a good mood. Very cheap as well and nice employees."}
{"text":"Went here with my coworker for a quick lunch- I got 2 hotdogs with sauerkraut on them and a cup of beef vegetable soup with a drink for less than $8.  The vegetable soup was fantastic!! Homemade and tasted like it was cooked low and slow. Yummmmm!  The hotdogs and sauerkraut were also very tasty. The wait was a little bit long, but it was 12:30 and for lunch I am happy to see that people are still loyal to local spots instead of the many chain restaurants/fast food on Noblestown Road."}
{"text":"A good Brighton Hot Dog Shop. They get the hot dogs right and the fries are nice and crispy."}
{"text":"They have hot dogs, hamburgers, and fries....they do a few small things and they do them well.     It's no 5 guys but if you want a hot dog and some fresh cut fries it is worthwhile to hit the place up and grab a bite to eat.    The biggest bonus to this place is they have plastic cups that will pile up in your cupboard until you eventually have to donate them."}
{"text":"What a treat to have one of these Beaver County staples right here in the city!  This is a large location and hey do offer a drive thru window. The food is always delicious here!  In an area with lots of chain places it's refreshing to see more of a mom and pop type place."}
{"text":"Being a fan of the location in Rochester, I decided to give this location a try since it's close to my work. I was (once again) impressed! Not only by the prices, but the quality of food. I got two burgers and fries all for less than $10. Both of the employees were lovely as well. The decor inside is a little old fashioned, but it gives the place that character/charm. It makes you feel comfortable."}
{"text":"You haveeee to get the chili cheese fries omgggg! They're super generous with the potions too. Their hotdogs are average but the chili cheese dog makes me droll. Highly recommend for a quick, cheap, tasty stop!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the other Reviewers are talking about. Just because its cheap doesn't mean it taste good. I'd take quality over quantity any day. Soggy greasy fries, watered-down cheese,  and if thats chili, I'm a playboy center fold. Barely editable and not at all worth my drive from the Northside and back. Very very disappointed. Recommendation---try Steve's or JR's hot dogs on Federal St Northside. If they're closed and its the weekend, either make another choice or go to Original's in Oakland. Right now I wish the hell I had."}
{"text":"This is sweet little place that serves a great hamburger, hotdog, shakes and handcut French fries at amazingly low prices. Hubby and I ate for about $10. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because hubby said bathroom wasn't as clean as it could have been."}
{"text":"Ummmm how have I never heard of this place until now? Literally the best thing ever. Such great prices and such great food. If you leave without a milkshake then you're insane. The chili fries were a little gross, but the burger and hot dog were on the money. This is a Pittsburgh staple that you have to check out."}
{"text":"Wow.  Excellent Dogs & Cheeseburger.  The menu isn't huge but who cares?  It's Hot Dogs, Cheeseburgers, and Shakes.  Everything was wonderful!  It is a hole in the wall but my family loves those that have really great food!"}
{"text":"Wow what a great find. Got 2 chili and kraut dogs. The dogs where fantastic and the prices $1.55 each what a deal. Quick friendly service. Great place for quality cheap eats."}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers, and the kids really dug the hot dogs.  They have family meals that seem really economical.  The fries with cheese were fantastic, loved the cheese & glad it wasn't the cheap runny nacho stuff.  We left stuffed w/ a family of 4 for $20.  I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Fans of BHDS that we are (Kay used to work for 'em too), we had to call on this location since I'd never been to it before and because our stomachs were rumbling with hunger after a long Sunday afternoon of shopping, movie-viewing, and general errand-running.   Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe's hallmark is obviously their wieners (the cashier chuckled too when I ordered one by that synonym), but crikey if I don't think their tidy, tiny, economical, filling, show-stealing cheeseburgers are what really improve my mood. Cooked flat and crispy without sacrificing moisture, when diners have their burgers topped with their unwaveringly savory and mildly sweet chili and diced onion, The Redhead weeps for her father's larger burgers fall beneath The Frank's fresh ground might.   Have that same red lava ladled onto a batch of and ideal hay-pile of their slightly brittle french fries, and your troubles will melt away for a short time.   And yes, most of everything BHDS puts out is prepared daily and freshly, either on the premises of each satellite or at a central processing facility.   This isn't gourmet. This isn't Franktuary or Station Street gouging the upwardly mobile with pretension, gentrification, trendiness, and sheer fraud. This is just honest quick-serve food made the way it used to be 50-60 years ago, well before The Clown became insane with wealth and power. BHDS doesn't try to be anything it is not and comparing it to more upmarket restaurants of its kind is foolish and lazy.   Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe beats (embarrasses?) its competitors by maintaining a menu that is brief, tasty, and philanthropically affordable. I only hope BHDS doesn't become too big for fear of the quality dipping."}
{"text":"Frank (their mascot has a name after all) has made it into the outskirts of Pittsburgh. Short on funds on a Friday night, Kay and I decided to come to this one since we hadn't been to it yet. Besides, we wanted to verify its existence. Who knew there was a BHDS  fighting it out with the other fast food chains on the border between Greentree and Crafton?  BHDS is offering a hot sausage sandwich for a, err...limited engagement, and it's a tender, spicy winner of a weiner topped with onions, tomato sauce, and diced green peppers.   We spoke with the manager here, and according to her, she makes a dollar more an hour with BHDS than she did with the neighboring Wendy's. How about that?  May the Redhead eat her prissy little heart out. BHDS remains the very best example of what fast food can be.   P.S. The employees and patrons alike were rather amused to find that we were BHDS fans and were astonished when we told them there were more out in Beaver County. Furthermore, they were really tickled when Kay revealed that she was once an associate.  \"We thought this was the only one,\" an elderly gentleman said before heaping praises on BHDS's quality, variety, and low prices.   P.P.S. If you are nearly broke and hungry, please stop at a BHDS instead of a McDonalds if you are close to one. The evil clown makes enough money but doesn't make food nearly as good as BHDS. He must be stopped!!!! May Frank be victorious!   P.P.P.S. BHDS makes their own collectable cups. Kay has one with the American Idol judges all \"frankfurtered\" out. Their latest cup is a tribute to the sit-com \"Cheers.\"  P.P.P.P.S. They have drive-thru!"}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch between two meetings nearby.  It your are in a hurry or just want a good dawg and fries, this is a good quick place."}
{"text":"This is 'dah bomb' for Pittsburgh food places. Primantis is overated and Mike and Tony's is spread too thin. Great place. Great food. Great service. Great Franchise. Every shoppe has an individual feel and is deeply burgh through and through. the cups are scary and AMAZING. The Moon TWP Hot Dog Shoppe is by far my favorite. Part of the Town. Part of the 'burgh. LONG live it!!"}
