{"text":"Amazing food and one of the best long islands I have had-ever. The cigar smell is a downer but it was quickly forgotten after 15 min. 
Amazing food for a sports bar (had the beer battered taco)!"}
{"text":"$22 for wings and 1 IPA pint
Wings good
Beer kinda cool not warm certainly not cold.
Service not very warm or out going. And why is the til/cash drawer left open?"}
{"text":"The guy who waited on us was really nice, so I feel bad not giving this place a better review. It's an ok place if you want to get a beer I guess, but we did not enjoy the food. Sandwich was mediocre, The side salad was alright, but terrible onion rings. The place has older furniture in it, but it does have allot of tv's and horse betting if you are into sports."}
{"text":"I love this local bar and grill. Food is great something for everyone. Try the Ribs, burgers or wings, my favorite salads is the gorgonzola !
Kari and her team are the best...friendly and accommodating ..!!!"}
{"text":"Great place with the new ownership. Lots of new additions and the food is finally good again."}
{"text":"I would return to this place without hesitation but it's not necessarily the best in the valley. I LOVED the food - the grilled chicken sandwich was worthy of a much higher price tag and for $9 it was a steal. I do however wish that they would have a larger selection of \"craft\" or local beers and the service was a bit scattered. A few minutes to decide what beer that I wanted would've been preferred rather than a server hover as soon as we were seated. All in all, nice people, great food, and cool environment. Not overbearingly sports bar-esque but you can still watch the game."}
{"text":"It has been months since the last visit and, sadly, the new name has not brought improvement.  The menu is overhauled and underwhelming.   I'm rating a full star higher than deserved because the tater tots were delightfully hot and crispy...unlike the rest of the entree, which was sent back.  Maybe having three different servers complicated things.  Indulge at your own risk."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first and last time today at lunch. The waitress was not friendly at all. Found a long hair in my pork cheese fries. The waitress sat in a booth a few booths behinds us and used her hand to wipe her nose and then went to the next table. In their defense they did not charge me for the hairy fries......8-9/17.. Update since I received a reply to my review from the owner. I will give it a second chance everyone deserves a second chance right. I will  post my second review soon."}
{"text":"Flightless Wings are great!! Drinks are well made with great service. They have pinball, pool and off track betting too."}
{"text":"A friendly neighborhood bar this is so much more! New ownership with updated menu which varies from wings to burgers....salads to sandwiches. Thumbs up on the new menu. Lots of TV's everywhere you look so there is no bad seat in the house to watch your favorite sporting event. Also, they now have new college & NFL football specials and better yet ice cold beer. An establishment you should definitely check out. Can't wait to go back. Hope to see you there!!"}
{"text":"All baseball fans should come to this restaurant after their games especially games in Scottsdale. This place would be great for Diamondback, Colorado Rockies, and any fans in the area. This place has numerous large screen tvs to watch various sports including baseball, basketball, football, etc. I don't live in this area but go out of my way to come to enjoy the food, drinks, and atmosphere. All the servers are wonderful as are the bartenders. The manager welcomes all with her warm smile. This place has become our favorite restaurant in Arizona and that says so much."}
{"text":"We were rushed out which is strange considering the bar was almost empty on a Friday night.

My husband and I came here ordered a couple of drinks. He ordered chicken wings and I had the eggplant sandwich. we were sitting in a booth with only three other booths occupied and a couple of people at the bar.  After we were finished with dinner and before asking us if we wanted more drinks our waitress gave us our check. We were ignoring it because we wanted to finish our drinks and ideally order more but she kept on coming back to see if we paid that finally we ended up paying since she seems that she just wanted to leave even though it was not even 10pm!


Life too short for bars that rush you out. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding. The food was slightly above average. It wasn't the most beautiful clean place I've ever been"}
{"text":"Smells like a bowling alley inside and a cigar lounge outside (thanks in no part to the neighboring business). Bright side is... the food is very good and the draft selection is ok.

Service was very good, food was delivered quick. No complaints other than the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I did a yelp search for mac & cheese and this place had such cheesy goodness that i didn't even think to take a photo before wiping my plate clean. my boyfriend ordered a turkey rueben, but it turned out they were out of turkey. he got a grilled chicken sandwich instead, which he said was ok. i ordered a yelp $0.01 drink special, and was disappointed when the bill came back without the drink special price and with my boyfriend's sandwich incorrect. they fixed it quickly, though, so all is good. i do believe we will be back."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE their salads! Reasonable prices, lots of room, good food! Great daily specials! Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Lots of locals that booze it up pretty good, friendly people nice bartender.
Food prices are kind of high for burgers otherwise ok.....$8 would be good at least for a happy hr price."}
{"text":"Came in here late night just for some food and a beer. Turned out to be pretty good. Typical sports bar. Kind of hole
In the wallish but clean enough. Had the queso and chips and fish tacos. Surprisingly good. No problems here if you wanna grab some bar food and a beer. Plus aviation is cool"}
{"text":"Cool new spot in Scottsdale! The new owners have really changed things up a bit! Come in with the family and ask for their new children's interactive place mats!  Keep the kids busy while you watch the game and enjoy a great burger!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area, and this was one of the first places I checked out... In the past 3 months I have been here several times.. Service rocks!!! Friendly,informative, and very accommodating!  
Sciracha/honey wings grilled are the bomb diggity!  Burgers and fries phenomenal!  Had their Caesar salad last week and it was great.. Everything is fresh and clean.  Food and establishment wise..
I've been when it's crazy busy and a little slower... Great service every time...
They make the best old fashioned in the valley.. Bartenders are excellent at their craft!  
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Check this place out!  We ordered takeout, so I can't comment on the atmosphere, but their food is awesome.  We ordered the \"gold & bold\" wings which were maybe some of the best wings I've ever had - order them for sure!  They get everything done quick and, best part, they deliver to the nearby brewery."}
{"text":"Food and service was good, place was busy. I had the Cobb salad and it was loaded with bacon, chicken, and cheese. Waitress was always on top of drink orders and servicing our group."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went for lunch.  We sat at a table for 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. After we we're finally able to order, we waited another 20 minutes. They were not busy at all during this time. No apologies when our food finally arrived.  Her flatbread was doughy and undercooked and my chicken strips were charcoal.  Waiter was indifferent and owner was aloof.  We will definitely never be going back!!!"}
{"text":"After a handful of visits it's time for a review. I've been looking for true neighborhood spot since 2002. This is as close as I have ever gotten to such a spot. I guess I have never lived close enough to anything that gives off that vibe. The Hangar is full of regulars that have their favorite seats at the bar, and its fun to watch their discomfort when somebody else is sitting in their spot. Total discombobulation.

The food is bar food, but that's what is should be. WIngs and burgers are very good. The hard to find fried pork tenderloin sandwich is a rare special, but it took me back to my roots. PUT THIS ON THE MENU!!!

A very respectable selection of beers. Staff is friendly and a little feisty (as it should be).

There is OTB on the far side of this place, and smokers on the patio. However, usually smells like a decent cigar, so keep it up sir, or madame.

Great place to watch sports, too. Lots of tv's covering all that is happening.

So, check them out and sit at the bar just to mess with a regular (of which you could very easily become)."}
{"text":"When I got home from work on Friday I realized I left my $8 juice drink at the office, which is 26 miles from home.  Well darn it.  I had driven through this plaza before on my way to work, probably to get an unhealthy breakfast at Jack in the Box, and decided to bring my unsuspecting husband along with me yesterday to get my juice from the office so it wouldn't go to waste.  I only have to go in a few days out of the month and it would not last 2 weeks.    

We had a nice lunch here and I had no idea they do off track betting as well.  That meant there were lots of TVs, some showing horse racing, others showing baseball, and a really interesting crowd.  If you're from the East Coast, you'll find some of your peeps here, just sayin'.  The New Yawk and Joisey accents were heavy.  And loud.  

We started with an order of the gold and bold wings, finished on the grill ($11) and those were fantastic.  Probably the 2nd best wings we've had in the city (2nd to Nello's).  Those were some finger-licking deliciousness and I plan to get some of those to take home after work.  Soon.  

Then we shared their BLTA on sourdough ($10) and that was a nice sandwich with crispy fries.  We tried a couple of Innis Gunn brews we had never had before, and I had a Mama's Yella Pils as well.  All in we spent $41.55 after tax, before tip.  Jordan was our server and she was friendly and fun to talk to.  

So after burning a few bucks in gas, spending $50 on lunch, and my husband bought a cigar next door, we got my $8 drink from the office."}
{"text":"Oh my Lord. Took home the ribs and fries.  I am from Texas and these could be the best ribs I have ever had! Seriously. If you go here this weekend, well worth it."}
{"text":"Walked in with a group of 7 and almost walked back out. Didn't look like we'd be getting any decent food here. We stand corrected! Ha! The food..even the salads were good. The drinks were prepared exactly as we ordered them and, trust me, I'm PICKY!!! Our waitress was a cute little brunette and she was perfect! Thx!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a drink. Not amazing food, but pretty decent for bar food. Only negative part was the music going from very loud to very quite. A little distracting."}
{"text":"Visited for the first time on a Saturday afternoon and unfortunately Hangar missed the mark. Between the three of us we had, a burger, fries, wings Hangar style, BLAT sandwich and tots. The burger and toast from the sandwich tasted as if the grill wasn't cleaned properly or at all between items and just had a weird taste. The bacon was disappointing. And as much as I love grilled wings - I still appreciate a good amount of sauce and there wasn't even that. They were so bland. We didn't have any cocktails so maybe if I visit in the future I'll try something else and order a drink. My one star is for the decor and nice server we had. Sorry Hangar, better luck next time."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the wait staff is horrible. They need to get off their phones and work!"}
{"text":"We've been coming to this sports bar through it's many name changes and this is by far the best it's been yet. The food is definitely upgraded. While the decor is not as upgraded, it's not a bad place to hang and with the game(s), as they added a huge screen and have several large tvs. The food is awesome- we had the gobbler sandwich, which was delicious. We also split the burger and the gold bold wings, all of which were also delicious. Everything is well priced. It's great to have such a kickass neighborhood place with great food and great prices!"}
{"text":"The more I visit this place the more I like it.  It's pretty dark inside with a bunch of TVs to watch sports or the horse races.  The servers all seem friendly and I've had a beer here but never tried the food.

What sets The Hangar apart is that they offer off-track betting on the horse races.  It's kinda fun to place a bet and see how your horse does in the race at whatever track.  It also cracks me up that there are always a bunch of old guys on the front patio smoking cigars and betting on the races.  I'll probably be one of them in a few years!"}
{"text":"Went with a large group and the staff was very friendly and prompt. I will definitely recommend this place to friends."}
{"text":"This was a great little sports bar, the cheese fries were amazing!  Music was a bit loud but I liked the food and the service was good."}
{"text":"Best place to watch the Phoenix Open. Kelly pouring.  Great food.  30 tv's +.  The service here is second to none. Bartender an absolute Hoot.  Will be back.  No question"}
{"text":"They really have stepoed up their game. The food is great, the customers are a good mix of regulars, happy hour business crowd and hardcore horse and dog betters. Makes for an entertaining atmosphere. 
The staff is friendly and will switch the closest TV to a different station without it being a huge hassle. They also have 'Theatre of Magic' one of the greatest pinball games of all time. I like this place and meet neighborhood friends there at least once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour especially if there is some kind sports on you are wanting to see. The Food is good and the Beer is cold!"}
{"text":"We checked out this place for dinner and we were pleasantly surprised. It looks a bit divey but has great food and friendly, attentive service. We started with the spinach dip wontons. These were very tasty. My husband had fish and chips and I had green chili mac and cheese. He enjoyed his fish and chips. I tasted his fries and they were very good. My green chili mac and cheese had excellent flavor. It is not as spicy as I was hoping it would be but I still loved it. I wish they would run it under the broiler a bit to get it a little brown and crispy on the edges. Drinks were good and they had a great selection of beer. My only complaint about the drinks is that I thought they were rather pricey. The nightly specials and happy hour prices of drinks were very reasonable so we are definitely going to return during that time."}
{"text":"Service still horrible. Sat at a table for 10 minutes- nobody came. Stood at the bar for 5- nobody there. Rinse and repeated twice then gave up."}
{"text":"Great place for drinks and food..lots of tvs for all your sports events...good prices and they offer industry for hospitality employees."}
{"text":"The staff at hangers is very friendly and accommodating.  The adult grilled cheese was excellent and the onions are with the trip alone."}
{"text":"Found this nice bar after a diamondbacks ST game.  Drink prices were good and plenty of tv's to watch whatever you want. Had the chicken teryaki bowl and it was worth it. My wife had a burger and she said it was really good! I tried a couple of her fries and they were good too"}
{"text":"I don't understand the high ratings for this place. Sure, there are plenty of TV's to watch your favorite team, but all sports bars have tons of TVs. The food was not good, and the atmosphere is pretty dull. Service was good, and they had outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great $2 taco Tuesday!  Meal was cooked just right!  The staff was friendly and aware of our needs.  Clean environment!  Would recommend this place to others!"}
{"text":"Food, beers and service was excellent. I appreciate hope in the wall local places that serve great craft beers. My husband had the beer battered fish tacos with the wild sour and he raves about both. I had the gyro and Estrella Jalisco draft beer and both were great. I really love made from scratch foods, it seems to be a rarity these days but the pita was spot on delicious. 

I also liked the atmosphere - sports bar with laid back casual ambience. Not loud, just right. Full of character with the regulars singing to the 80s music at the bar...it was fun.

I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great beer, delicious food and great wait staff. A wonderful date night place!"}
{"text":"Not too bad. It's dive with a nice touch. Went there for lunch and a beer. Food was average, beer was cold, and sports were on. Can't complain too much."}
{"text":"The theming is cool but the food was really bland and frankly not worth the price. We had high hopes but the food didn't match up. The menu has cool choices so it may be worth a second try but frankly our burgers were bland and the green choke pork fries lacked any flavor."}
{"text":"Not a gambler, but I am a fan of this place. 

Atmosphere - Well lit, which is actually rare in Scottsdale. It was a very open restaurant and I really liked the \"hanger\" style. flight decoration. Lots of TVs for sports, as it is a hot spot for OTB. 

Food - Very well priced for the quality. They have rotating specials daily, which varies from sandwiches to half racks of ribs. I ordered the B.L.A.T -- BLT with Avocado -- It was DELICIOUS. They had some pesto mayo on the sandwich which really pulled it together. The portion sizes were perfect. I would definitely say avoid the ribs -- they were extremely dry and there are much better places for ribs.

Service - It is a new place, and you can definitely tell that from their service. Our server was lovely, but not well informed about the establishment or the menu. Growing pains though, ammiright? 

We were able to enjoy WINE WEDNESDAY -- Half Price bottles of wine all day. So, You are welcome."}
{"text":"We were in North Scottsdale on a Friday night and wanted to find a local spot and this place is it. Dive bar feel with really awesome food. Industry discount is awesome. Any bar/restaurant that takes care of their own gets a good review!"}
{"text":"This place always smells sooo good!  Like freshly cleaned floors.

Great weekly specials and the beer is always ice cold. 

Great staff as well :)"}
{"text":"Hard to leave a review for a place when you go unrecognized at the bar for about 10 minutes with only half the seats even filled. Will choose not to try again. It's a bummer because we still haven't found that local neighborhood bar yet. Will stick with Zipps for now I guess. So sad that local businesses don't provide impeccable service. That's your only commodity."}
{"text":"Was in a bad mood after a crap day. Randomly walked into The Hangar in search of an attitude altering beer. Had to wade through a phalanx of cigar smoking old guys on the patio, but managed to snag a table by the bar. As my phone was almost out of juice it was a plus that each table was conveniently located near a power outlet. The beertender recommended a delicious pumpkin beer, always a good choice.  I then realized I was also hungry and took a chance on their Greek salad. It was ridiculously good. I'm not a local, but if I were this might be my home away from home."}
{"text":"This is a cool neighborhood hangout.  Lots of tv's, better than average beer list and the food was good as well.  It does have a little bit of a smokey odor to it probably b/c of the cigar shop next door and the patio where the OTB is staged.  Also, we were there in the evening and the OTB was running but you had to be outside to partake.  Hopefully they set it up inside during the day.  I'm sure I will be back there before too long."}
{"text":"If you love beer/ liquor and really good food plus sports u can't go wrong with the Hanger!!! Tommy and Jessica will treat you like Family. I'm from out of town and feel like i'm at my neighborhood hangout! You got to try this place. You will not be disappointed! Been in Scottsdale for 4 days for spring training and came here twice. Awesome!! 5stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience! We had a large group come in and the staff was very attentive and friendly! I'll definitely be bringing our group back!"}
{"text":"Nice little place in Scottsdale. Good prices as well. Service was excellent as was the food."}
{"text":"Wings are awesome,  recommend them with a nice cold beer...bartender brought different sauces before we ordered wings that made it even better."}
{"text":"I've now made a few visits here.  The food is an upgrade to typical bar food.  Service is prompt and courteous, if a bit informal.  Be aware that this is an OTB (off track betting site) and this is the primary emphasis  so  expect to see a lot of die hard gamblers peering at racing forms and nervously watching races. I've been told there is often a group outside waiting for the Hangar to open on many mornings.,   My favorite lunch on the menu is the adult grilled cheese served with tater tots.  Decent list of wines by the glass.  Business seems to pick up at traditional after work cocktail hours as most tracks have closed for the day, and the customer mix changes. Worth a stop if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Awesome place !!! A true pub, not many of those left in Az. TV's everywhere... Yes everywhere. Old school V bar. Quit a few different handles on tap too. Really like that they offer a variety of beer. You can even put a bet down on your favorite horse or greyhound in the other room. Pool tables and a few arcade games are just around the corner. Start with the spinach wontons... really good."}
{"text":"The Boy and I were looking for a place to play pool on a Saturday night and decided to give The Hangar a try.

The Hangar is both a bar/restaurant and an OTB location.  We did not partake in the restaurant or the OTB portion, but I was impressed with their drink selection.  Our bartender, Tommy had a great sense of humor and made sure our drinks were exactly how we liked them. There was a snafu with their Hangar Vodka special but Tommy gave me several other options in its place.  They even carry organic vodka, that's pretty fancy for a restaurant or an OTB bar. 

Their draft beer selection was impressive, not just your domestic junk, as well as the bottle selection had some real gems.  When Tommy heard The Boy likes a good IPA, he had an awesome recommendation that did not disappoint.   

The only misstep was when I had to wait for the women's restroom  on the OTB side because a male staff member was using the women's facilities."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and this is quickly becoming our neighborhood haunt. Andrew, JJ, and the whole Hangar crew know how to take care of patrons -- especially when they relocated us from the patio to our own \"private\" room in a matter of moments to watch the Vikings game when a crazy monsoon hit! We will definitely be back to The Hangar!!"}
{"text":"Bartenders need training on what it means to work in the food service industry. Seems to be a growing trend. Feel like I'm constantly trying to get someone's attention to just get another drink or food ordered. It's like you are on their time and intruding. Probably won't go out of our way to come back."}
{"text":"A work function led me to the Hanger. Service was top notch, and the food was better than the average bar fare. The only knock was the music was annoying. Not because it was a bad choice of songs, but the volume kept fluctuating. I'm sure it will be fixed by now."}
{"text":"Place is fun, cold cold beer witch is the most important thing considering its 100 degrees outside.. Food is good..
I've been there twice first time I got the green chile cheese fry's omg a must try. 

Then my second visit I got the portobello mushroom shandwitch, was very flavorful. 
  Got crispy tots with it!!

Food was great, tons of TV's and fun to people watch, considering half of them are gambling on race tracks. I was under the impression it's now under new owner ship. Change is always good!! I can't wait until my next visit here the boneless wings area a must try!!!!"}
