{"text":"The food is always burnt or way over cooked. And that's putting it generously. Waiting staff can't remember your order from the table to the till. Have never gotten good service. Terrible menu options. So limited and burnt portions. No spice. No flavour. No options. And such small portion sizes for the price at a \"neighbourhood\" pub. Good luck Brixton!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Pub! hard to give a pub 5 stars, but there are no negatives.  Great staff, great food (maybe the best pizza in town) , great beer line up, great TVS and management is all over getting the proper games on, warm atmosphere,  clean, full of locals who are unpretentious and hold your breathe. ... a 20 oz pint of Beer for $6.  Not sure why I am writing this.... I want to keep it a secret!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood so I was glad that a new establishment opened up in this strip mall as it is so desperately needed.  Brixton's is a decent place.  Good menu.  Have been there for WINGS night several times - an excellent value!  Its busy in there on Wings night though.  Once I ordered the dumplings - that was a mistake.  They are deep friend and I expected pan fried...  not at all what I wanted, and not indicated on the menu that they are deep fried.  If I decide to order them again I will ask for pan fried ...  and see if they will do it.  I think they do a good business - based on the number of cars in the parking lot, especially around the dinner/evening hours, it looks like they are doing well.  That's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my partner and her parents as we had a long day and just wanted something nearby and easy.   Service started out fine until we let the server know we needed another minute. She said she would be back in a minute or two and left us to make our decisions, and then didn't come back for almost 15, and managed to never be looking in our direction so we could signal her. Plenty of time to be talking to other people in the bar and helping other tables, though.   When she did get to the table, no apology was made for the wait.   Most of the food was nothing special, all pretty standard pub fare, however the shrimp appetizer was no good. The entire pan of shrimp was overdone and they were all rubbery and inedible. We advised the server of this and she did take them back, and a gentleman who was either the manager or the cook came out to advise us that he would be taking them off the bill, which was great.   He also then took some time to explain that times were tough because they had been broken into that night, including taking a few minutes to explain everything about the breaking and complain about the police response,  and then went into a rant about Rachel Notley and how she put a big hit on his business by ruining the economy and making beer more expensive. This was a 5 or so minute rant that made the whole experience very, very awkward.   It sucks that you got broken into, and everyone is entitled to their own politics, but I don't need to hear about it when I'm trying to eat.   At the end of the evening, the bill came, and it still had the shrimp on it. As we were talking about it at the table, the cook/manager walked up and literally snatched it from my partners father's hand to get it dealt with. That was a little shocking itself.   Ultimately, if the service had been better and the one bad dish was the only issue, I'd give this place 3 stars, but our whole experience there was not very good and we will not be returning.   Maybe you'll get everyone on a better day and it'll be a better experience."}
{"text":"New owners. Does that mean new cook too?  Not enjoying the edamame any more. They came out \"greasy\" with no salt. They said it was from the beans. Nope. I've had them here lots. Never like this!  I need a wet nap to get the grease off.  Admit there's a mistake not say that's how the beans are...more greasy than the fries!"}
