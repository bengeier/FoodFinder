{"text":"We had just left a wedding and had a longer than expected wait before the reception so we googled and found Hog's Head.  Being from out of town, we had no idea what to expect.  What a great time!  The folks were fun, the chatter was lively, the service at the bar was more than excellent. We eat out a lot and this was one of the most 'real' places we had been in some time.  Both my husband and myself said if we could transport this place to our home in Morgantown WV, we would.  We debated going back for dinner, but we had a bit of a drive and decided to pass but we would visit again if we were in the area. Our advice?  Stop in and enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had the French Dip, and the open face roast beef.  Both were great.   Loved the fries and gravy as well as the vinegar based cole slaw .   Great service, good value and we are looking forward to going back to try more.   It's clean, spacious and a good atmosphere.  Looks like they have very good daily specials.  If I had one complaint, perhaps a more diverse craft beer selection is needed but at least they have a couple on tap and more in bottles.   We shall be back !"}
{"text":"Love their wing night! It gets busy but staff is still attentive and service is fast."}
{"text":"Our server, Kelsey, was fantastic. She never let our cups get empty, and she checked on us just enough - but not too much that it seemed like she was bugging us! The food was also delicious. Amazing fries, especially, both the fresh cut and the sweet potato. Some of the items weren't the same price on our slip as they were in the menu, but the discrepancy was so minimal (and the food was so good) that we didn't mind paying an extra dollar or two more than we expected. Don't let the external atmosphere/neighbor steer you away. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was great. Food was terrific, waitress was over every 10 minutes, gave my buddy six paintball park coupons just for the hell of it, it was super cheap, It is just a perfect local bar."}
{"text":"Well I just finished the the worst ever Italian Hoagie according to some retard yelp user and I have to say they are full of shit. As its always been since this place opened, AWESOME. Apearently someone's taste buds don't work. The food and service were great as usual so definitely stop in and try this place."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon to this little place so the wife and I decided to head over and check it out.  This place was AMAZING!!!  I got a \"this little piggy\" burger, which was quite possibly the best burger I have ever had.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood place. Great food, great quality. Some must trys are the pig wings and pizza. The weekday specials are a great deal too!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a chilled out sunday fixing of some bar food an brews with some friends. It was pretty empty for  sunday afternoon so they only had one bartender working which seemed odd..  but She did really good considering it was such a big place inside an she had to cover the bar, the dining area, and get food orders. Bartender was really friendly and welcoming A+.. Place seems it would be good for sporting events as well. Now onto the food. I got a dozen wings and 8 cut pizza. Spicy garlic parm wings were definitely good and meaty an the pizza was even better and on par with the top pizza places in pittsburgh. I would definitely revisit again in the future to try out some different menu items as they give you a great portions so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"Under new management, definitely turning the place around! Food is very good and at very reasonable prices. Great beer selection and nice eat in dining area as well as a separate bar area with plenty of tvs. 

Going back, definitely recommend this one to friends"}
{"text":"Great place for inexpensive drinks and quality food. Good menu and great atmosphere. I ordered a Texan burger and my wife had a hog fish sandwich, both were great. I highly recommend the hogs head bar and grill."}
{"text":"OH SO good. Food was delicious. Staff and atmosphere very friendly. First time visiting this little hideaway. Met a group of friends and had a great time. Good food. Good drinks. Good times. Will definitely be back especially since I've added them to my contacts. YUM!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant local joint. Friendly bartender. Good burger. Cold beer. All the right games on the TV."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Love the wings and burgers! Come in for a hog bowl Thursday nights 15 wings for $6; can't beat that. I love that this is so close to us."}
{"text":"My wife and I heard about this restaurant/bar through a friend and we were not disappointed. The food is great, the people are friendly and the prices you can't beat. We've been there three times since hearing about it and we will continue to stop by."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and both times everything was on point. From the quality and selection of food to the service and the atmosphere. This place has it all and I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a good time and great food."}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for some time, and my wife and I finally stopped down last night for dinner. We live fairly close as we're in West View but to say this restaurant is off the beaten path is an understatement. As soon as we walked in, it reminded us both of our hometowns.

It was 'Seat Yourself,' and despite a pretty full house we got a table right away. After reviewing the drink list, I don't think I saw a single beer over $4.50 which is amazing in its own right.

For dinner, we ordered some wings as an appetizer, the meatloaf special for me, and the French dip for my wife.

After some time our entrees were delivered and the waitress apologized that they came out before the wings. I'm actually thankful as it had to be the biggest plate of meatloaf and mashed potatoes I've ever seen. The meatloaf was absolutely delicious and just what I needed on a cold winter night. My wife enjoyed her sandwich and fries as well.

A minor mishap with the wings, and I hope to try them soon as we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"3rd time here. Love the food, but service was really slow. It was very busy but only 2 waitresses. Waited 10 minutes before someone cleaned the table.
Advertises Fresh French fries but they were frozen. 
Needs to hire more help. Would not rush back because of the service."}
{"text":"I love this place! For a smaller establishment, the menu is superb. The staff is so friendly and the owner is the cook and is there almost every day! They also have live music every so often as well as holiday parties. I would recommend this to everyone including families. I also love wing night!"}
{"text":"Such a great little find. I cannot recommend this place enough. The fries are probably my favorite bar fries around Pittsburgh. 

Service is great, everyone is nice. The Carolina BBQ sauce is amazing, I get it every time that I go. There are different specials every week, which are definitely worth a try. Last week I had the brisket sandwich, and it was incredible. I wish it was a permanent menu option! 

Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"Great food! The new owner has really turned things around and revamped both the menu as well as the atmosphere. This place is definitely worth the trip! They even offer specials on both food and beverages on a regular basis! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came in to watch a soccer match the other day. I called first to make sure it would be on. The lady who answered the phone didn't seem too enthused with my questions about what channels they receive and what beers were on tap, but it didn't deter my intention of going. I get there, the match is on, and I ordered the gyro special (biggest gyro I've ever had) with a beer. The woman behind the bar, Trudy, was very nice to me and I could tell she knew a lot of the people in there. The specials are top notch and affordable. Can't wait to go back and try the wings."}
{"text":"Great food. A little off the beaten path but worth it. Wings cooked to perfection. Louisiana ox sauce is great. Pizzas are incredible!"}
{"text":"We gave this place a second try. Unfortunately my most favorite fresh cut fries were currently off the menu. They said they have been too busy to freshly cut the fries, but they hope to go back to them soon. 

Although I was disappointed with the fry situation, I was NOT disappointed with anything else. Service was great, wings were delicious, and the spinach feta pizza was so yummy! 

I used a Yelp coupon, pay $10 for $15 worth of food. Downside: not able to be used on any of their specials.

Still love this little local place and look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time. Had the salmon with spinach and feta. It was excellent! My husband had the steak sandwich with the egg, fries and coleslaw- I forget the name. Also excellent. The fries were great. Would go again."}
{"text":"Ok, so after reading the owner's review. I do admit that on my 3rd visit, I did find parking... Also on my third visit I decided to eat at the bar instead of getting takeout, and I realized why there were always so many people in the parking lot... Beers here are cheap! I mean, Magic Hat for like $3, I haven't seen that in Pittsburgh since before I was legally allowed to drink! 

Also, their eat in specials are crazy! My husband got the pizza, which we expected to be a small personal pizza for like $7 and she brings out a L-XL whole freaking pizza. WTF? I mean, how can they possibly make money? 

Now that I know your secrets, I will be back!"}
{"text":"I was so hungry for a good burger and this is our \"go to\" place for really, really good burgers.  They use fresh meat and the buns are so tremendously soft with perfectly browned tops and their mushroom swiss concoction is what \"mushroom swiss burger nirvana\" is really all about.  It's all I seem to order here because it's that good. 

Tonight, however, we were hungry for more.  We ordered up some well done garlic parmesan wings with a side of celery and ranch and sipped on our cold beers until they arrived.  Those wings were amazing.  The fresh minced garlic and butter coated the super crispy wings and left a delicious pool of garlicky butter at the bottom of the basket that we scooped up and slathered onto our freshly cut French fries.  Oh my gosh, unbelievably good.  

Their beer and drink prices are so reasonable too.  Service was very good again.  It's usually the same two women waiting tables and they are both always very warm and efficient. 

We love this place so much but wonder how long before we have to wait for a table.  This is a real hidden gem that's only minutes from the Parkway North Hazlett Street exit.  

It's worth a visit or great for take out."}
{"text":"The ribs and pig wing were delicious. The atmosphere and area are somewhat enchanting. The service was just ok. We were there on wine down Wednesday so the $3 wines were a good thing. We will return."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for dinner after seeing the reviews on Yelp.  It was worth the travel down the terrible roads to get there.  Sign on the outside is a little deceiving...\"Grand Opening. 5th times a charm\" but the food was quite tasty and my husband was happy with the Guinness on tap.  We would definitely go back on another trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I will give this place the benefit of the doubt and go off my friend's rating of Hog's Head of a 4.5 as well as the feedback I received from my boyfriend after trying their takeout I ordered for him.  For this go-around, I will give a 3.5.. A-OK.  Definitely open to giving them another shot, though.

I met one of my girlfriends here for an early dinner on Monday.  It is such a strange and unexpected location for a restaurant I thought, but I love that type of place filled with locals and regulars.  Luckily, it was a straight shot from my office to the restaurant.  When we got there, we parked across the street and entered through the back(ish) door of the bar.  The entire bar turned and stared at us.  Maybe they aren't used to new faces?  Not sure.  We were told there was seating in the dining room which was large and open with quite a few 4+ seat tables.  There were a few other families there.  Their special of the day was that it was their wing night!  Perfect. I love wings.

We ordered their buffalo chicken fries to start and they were....heavenly.  Not sure why we thought two dozen wings to follow would be a grand idea, but we ordered them anyway - 1 dozen spicy garlic parm, 1/2 doz honey bbq and 1/2 spicy teriyaki.  I asked for them extra crispy.  Unfortunately, I was not a fan of these wings.  The chicken was not very tender and although they were a decent size, they weren't crispy and they seemed to have a lot of gristle on them.  We each ate a few, but the number consumed didn't compare to how many we boxed up and eventually just tossed.   I also noticed that I was charged full price for the wings instead of their special price of $.50...maybe this was because we boxed them up and took them home?  Not a big deal, just something I noticed. So for me personally, the wings were a miss here.  I did take Bobby a salmon Caesar salad with an order of fries with gravy on the side.  He LOVED the homemade croutons and dressing and raved about the fresh fries and gravy.  I have to agree with him - they were excellent.

The place was not very busy, only a few other tables with families that had [screaming] children and our waitress was SO friendly.  She took great care of us and was willing to accommodate all of our requests.

I would definitely give this place another shot, but I think next time I would try something different.  It seems like their sandwiches are what they do best.  Wouldn't mind having a few drinks here either as their bar was pretty nice and a decent size."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for the last 6 months but hadn't got around to it until today.  My girlfriend and I stopped in for a beer and a quick lunch.  The inside of the bar was very nice and updated, with a good number of TVs for watching sports.  Restaurant side, bar side and upstairs (Pool table, etc) make this a great place for anyone.

The food was fantastic!  It stood up to the lofty expectations that I had placed on it from reading previous Yelp review.  We ordered the Chicken Ranchero wrap which was perfect!  Per Kelsey's (Server/Bartender) recommendation we also ordered a pepperoni pizza, which was very good.  

A diamond in the rough.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding but for the one poor woman waiting on the entire room.  Had the Meatloaf Special(5).  The Reese's' cheesecake was the perfect ending to the meal."}
{"text":"Located in a deep hollow on the north side, it is well  worth the trip. They post daily specials (both regular and non-recurring) on their Facebook Page.  If you see the Hog Wing's special, get your butt over there and enjoy something different; these are NOT your typical chicken wings!  Brisket, pulled pork and ribs also well worth it.  Bartenders and restaurant staff friendly attentive and helpful.  Owner is making this a successful business and I expect greater things from him.  If you live in the suburbs you want him to expand to your area.  Forget the national chain's blasé food, get out of the far suburbs, cross the rivers and give it a try.  I guarantee that you'll enjoy your visit!"}
{"text":"A friend took me here after work because it is near his home.

Two words , the cheeseburger. 

First bite and my mouth exploded with flavor. Cooked to perfection, bun was perfectly selected and toasted! The whole burger was just pure juiciness and a texture bomb! Loved it. 

Great little pittsburgh gem! Glad I found it. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The Wings.  Louisiana OX sauce.  Delicious.
The Steak Hoagie.  Perfect.
The Spring Garden Burger.  Delectable.
The waitress.  Sweetheart.
The Pinball machine.  Classic.

The review.  Five MASSIVE stars."}
{"text":"Went to this establishment for the first....and probably the last....time. 
Menu was encouraging, but the food was a TOTAL disappointment.

The soup of the day was some sort of beef-something...hard to tell. It was thin broth, that I honestly compared to the broth left in the bottom of a pan when roasting a piece of beef, and then poured into a bowl. ??? 

The salad was ho-hum boring, nothing great, and was not \"loaded with a mountain of cheese\"..there was barely any on it. 

The Italian Hoagie was the kicker, though. It tasted like something I would buy at the
grocery store deli case, and went home an microwaved it. It was not crisply baked,
as indicated on the menu, and the meat was of low quality, greasy and unappealing.
The fries were served almost luke warm.

I mentioned this to the wait staff, and she said, \"oh\", took my uneaten sandwich and put it into a \"to-go\" container, as I told her I would at least give it to my dog.  She had no concern, questions, nothing. Sad.

The atmosphere is lovely, and I only wish that the food lived up to the expectations,
of the décor and the fabulous menu.  We have no interest in returning to even see if this was a fluke."}
{"text":"We decided to try Hog's after reading reviews on Yelp. We plugged the address in our GPS and off we went. Since we are still relatively new to the area, I had no idea where we were going and it didn't help that it was dark; the bar is off the beaten path. I was happy to find that they have a parking lot across the street. 

We decided to sit at the bar and order food. The bar is a nice size and I would guess it's awesome in the summer with all of the windows open. (We'll have to go back once it warms up to find out.)

I thought they offered a nice selection of beer both drafts and bottles. The bartenders were friendly and attentive even though you can tell this is a bar that typically sees regulars. 

My husband and I both enjoyed our food. They have the typical bar food; sandwiches, pizza, burgers, wings. Let's be honest, any place that has hot cheese balls on the menu is a winner in my book. 

The Thursday special was a \"hog bowl\" and it seemed very popular. Basically 15 wings in a large dog dish. 

We'll definitely go back now that we know where it is."}
{"text":"Hog's head is an absolute treat, that I wish was closer to my House! I love the restaurant itself, very beautiful and clean. You can tell that they take pride in there place of work and it shows. The food matches the setting, absolutely wonderful. The wings are awesome, my steak sandwich was fantastic, my Girlfriend's burger was great, and the beer is cold and cheap. Whenever we are on this side of town, this will be one of our staples. The only 'divey' aspect would be what I assume are their regulars. Older gentlemen that were three sheets by 6pm. They were harmless, but somewhat of a distraction from what otherwise was an awesome dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh for the week and my friend recommended this place and I couldn't have been happier. There's a real homey tavern feel to Hog's which was enjoyable, and damn was this one of the best burgers I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday for the first time since it opened under new management. I had a burger and it was very good, my husband got the \"Louie Lipps\" fish and he absolutely loved our daughter got wings and enjoyed them tremendously.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Oh Hogs Head. How I love you! The daily specials make for a great deal and the beer selection is super. My favorite part of our past visit was our server Wendy. She was super sweet to my 3 year old son. He even commented that she was the best server ever! If you're looking for a bar with a local feel, good food, and great service, Hogs Head is for you. On second thought, don't go there...I want to make sure there's always room for me!"}
{"text":"Went to Hogs Head for lunch with friends.  Food there is good. Service is horrible! Got there and I was the only one there. Did not see a waitress until after my friend came and we sat there for a while.  She said I'll be with you in a minute. By the time everyone got there she managed to give us a menu. Things got no better. Orders were wrong, things asked for that never came etc. Now if they were busy I may not have a problem.  But the place was empty.  
I will go back at dinner time, because the foods pretty good. Never again for lunch."}
{"text":"First time here.  Parking lot is across the street and not lit at night.  Dining area to the left of a small, cozy bar in the middle of a residential area.  
You would think with the name it would be strictly a barbecue restaurant.  Heck, the sign is a neon pig outside.  But the closest thing to barbecue is a pulled pork sandwich.  No ribs here, and the only chicken is wings.  They have pasta, burgers, salads, fish, hoagies and soup.
I heard about the meatloaf in this place from the other reviews, and decided to try it.  A large portion of thick sliced meatloaf with gravy and mashed skin on potatoes and gravy.  Filling, but not overly flavorful, but heck, meatloaf is NOT a gourmet food. 
Went to the bar after dinner.  Two Jacks and Cokes were $ 8.00 and watched a hockey game with some real knowledgeable Pens fans, who were having discussions over the NHL offsides rules.  So I guess I will call this a kind of sports bar.
Looks as if they have specials all week, including a wings special on Thursdays which I am definitely going to try next time back.  Spent $ 30 with tax and tips, and wasn't hungry or thirsty when I left."}
{"text":"Just what we needed after an exhausting day! We were staying in town at the Hampton Inn so this was a quick drive from McKnight area. In a neighborhood so definitely use your GPS or you'll miss it! There was a hockey game on that night so the place was packed. Super casual but I liked the effort they put into their menu. Much better than the traditional bar food. We had burgers but they were great. Tons of different options and probably the best sweet potato fries I've ever had! 

I saw a ton of people ordering and raving about their wings but we were too stuffed to try that. There are a ton of TV's even in the dining area so you won't miss a thing if you go during Hockey or football season!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I will find my way back to this place, we went there on a cold, cold first night of winter.  Great Italian-style fare, and mainly bar food, but my girlfriend and I felt a bit out of place at the bar.  If I was a die hard sports fan (I am a Pittsburgher, but those days of caring about scores are behind me), I'd probably call this my first choice watering hole.  The bartender was very nice, even though we could not seat ourselves in the dining room due to some sort of restriction (though others were seated there we noticed).  Understandible, however.  The steak \"au jus\" was good, but it was just steak-um style diamond-cut steak like they use in cheesesteaks.  Would love to see real roast beef like they do for you in Brooklyn, rather than the Pittsburgh midwestern knock-off.  Anyway, the meatballs were great and the marinara was very, very nice.  Good place for an honest meal.  There were some exotic/craft beer selections, but it was your basic IC light, Coors light crowd. In younger days, my dad would have liked it.  Had to take Rialto street to get there though -- if you aren't familiar it is one of the world's steepest roads."}
{"text":"Sitting back in-the-cut on Spring Garden Road, this hole-in-the-wall is exactly what I need in my life. It's that perfect mix of bar/dive atmosphere with a slightly more sophisticated menu. We've already visited twice in a week. I think it's safe to say we're going to be regulars! 

The atmosphere is what you'd expect. There is a bar and a separate dining room. Everything is very open, making it easy to hear your neighbors conversation, but it's still very comfy and cozy. They have a few TVs and arcade games. 

The food is perfect! Pizza, fries and cheeseburgers are all very good, but my favorite was their Cajun steak hoagie. OMG! It was definitely an interesting twist from your typical Philly Cheesesteak. Seasoned with a Cajun spice, the steak with chopped and cooked just right. It practically melted in your mouth. Must try! 

The best part about this place is the phenomenal deals and prices. They run great daily specials on both food and drink that you can't pass up. For the quality and price, you can't go wrong. Four beers, two hoagies and fries and a pizza all came between $30-$40. 

It's definitely a weird location, but if you're in the area you have to try! For sure a local gem."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar - restaurant with good wings and fabulous pizza.  French onion soup is a must and the chicken sandwiches and burgers won't disappoint.   There is something for everyone here."}
{"text":"At first, I thought this place was going to suck. But the food was delicious and the beer was cold. Please give the cook a hug because \"This Little Piggy\" burger was straight FIRE!!!! Pulled pork, onion rings, bacon, coleslaw, pepper jack cheese on top of a burger...wow

Happy hour $3 craft beers."}
{"text":"Great dive bar, I use that term loosely as the decor was much nicer than the average dive bar.  Bubble Hockey and a few arcades for the kids.   Wings were very solid, I ordered them well done as I usually do.  Pizza as average but special was $6.99 for a large which is hard to beat.  My wife got the infamous Italian Hoagie and thought it was very good.  Only negative is the location."}
{"text":"As a life pittsburgh-er I have visited this bar/restaurant more times than I can count. Since the newest owner has taken over I have to say everything has been revamped and updated. The last two Friday's I ordered a head for pick up. The food was hot and ready on time even when the seating area was completely full. 
The bar area is separated from the dining area but it is still close enough to keep the bar atmosphere. 
Everything I noticed was clean and up to date. While paying for my take out order I noticed that the wait staff was pleasant and friendly. 
I hope this can continue and that the business continues to grow."}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, awesome owner! Big menu with large portions, lots of beer selections - all affordable & delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent. Great service and a great staff. On the ball. All the burgers are incredible and the layout is awesome. Love this little place."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a gem in disguise. My husband and I went here for dinner. We had the nachos for an appetizer which were great, I had the Cajun steak hoagie, and he had the chicken ranchero wrap. All of our choices were good.. They also have crazy specials throughout the week for food and drinks, so we will definitely be back! You can park across the street in a lot which is convenient because the bar is located on a main road. There is a separate dining area which is nice. Can't wait to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Wife and I wanted wings and for some reason we broke away from the 2 places we typically order from and wanted to try something new.  I will say, I'd like to give Hog's Head a second chance as the space inside was great, the people were friendly, and the prices were right.  The wings though just lacked.  The overall texture to me needs have that crunchy coating holding up to a lot of sauce while the interior meat stays juicy.  The wings were cooked properly just not how I prefer them.  The sauces were lacking as well and while good, just underwhelmed us.  We grabbed takeout, and honestly didn't finish them and didn't save them for leftovers (we normally do and I end up having leftover wings for lunch the following day).  
I will come back Hog's Head and dine in."}
{"text":"Wings , burgers and service really good !   Drama free and fresh ingredients !    Prime rib sandwich looked great !  My fellow diners sucked it up with rave reviews !"}
{"text":"Awesome Prime Rib French Dip and fries with gravy \"GREAT PLACE\""}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Very family friendly. Visited Pittsburgh for 2 weeks, ate here 4 times!! Every time we asked the kids (6 kids aged 7 through 16) where they wanted to go when we ate out they all shouted 'Hogs Head!'... Great tasting food with deals everyday. Especially their house burger. Great beer selection. And the people there are amazing! Kelsey.... With a contagious smile; very helpful and attentive with our group of 11!!! The kids all loved her! Trudy.... Funny funny lady had us laughing and laughing on our first visit.... Jennifer, our bartender on our last night there.... Kelsey's mom, another friendly bartender.... The owner, nice friendly guy.... came out to check on us.... Will definitely return when next I'm in Pittsburgh.

{"text":"My wife and I went here the other night for dinner.
It seems to be in the middle of nowhere and at first glance no parking.
There is however a gravel parking lot with plenty of parking across the street.
Walking into the restaurant it is a big open space with lots of tables.
The place was empty when we got there which was good for us.
I had the cod with french fries a salad and a french onion soup.
The soup was really good and so was the salad.
Th cod was great and the portion was so big i took half home.
I found the prices to be very reasonable and food was great.
The service was super fast and the waitress was very friendly.
I would highly recommend Hog's Head Grill to all that are in the area.
I will definitely be going again."}
{"text":"Food one step above regular bar food.  Slim beer list.  Get ready to wait...dinner for four on a Friday night...1 1/2 hours.  Friendly service especially towards kids."}
{"text":"At first google map glance, I was hesitant about its location...upon arriving there is a large gravel parking lot across the street, plenty of parking on a Sunday.  When I entered the restaurant I was pleasantly surprised to find a nice open space with lots of tables and most importantly a clean space.  The restaurant area and adjoining restrooms were clean and well maintained. Most of the place is beautiful dark wood.  Up a few stairs was a large bar with around 20 seats and another set of restrooms upstairs (which I did not use).

I came to Hog's Head for a Baby Shower so our food was preselected and displayed buffet style. Our choices were chicken fingers, salad, hoagies, and Vodka Aurora.  The Vodka Aurora was great, so good I took a container home.  The salad, chicken fingers and hoagies were all good quality \"bar food\".  The wait staff was pleasant and kept our tables clean.

There was no smoking, the restaurant is kid-friendly, but there's a nice adults only bar area, and it's a very casual setting (jeans and a t-shirt).  If I lived closer this would be an easy \"go grab some food and a beer\" kind of place for me."}
{"text":"Great meal with my wife and kids. I enjoyed the porky pig pulled pork sandwich. Everything on the menu looked great. We live in the neighborhood and will be back."}
{"text":"Great little spot.  The bbq is quality and they make their own bbq sauce.  (Try the Carolina sauce).

Beer selection is sparse compared to a lot of other spots, however the food is consistent and the patrons are down to earth.

If you're looking for an \"off the map\" spot between the Northside and North Hills, check it out."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to try that's affordable and casual and I stumbled upon Hog's Head. I've been here for burger night, and it keeps bringing my husband and I back. They have a special $5 burgers and fries on Wednesdays and the burgers are delicious! The bun is soft and the burger is nice and juicy. They also have awesome drink specials every night of the week, and there are TV's around the bar so it's a great place to watch a game. The bartender we've had is very friendly and welcoming to those who aren't regulars."}
{"text":"I had to go back to this place when I heard that it was under new ownership although the advertising is exactly the same. Went on their \"dog bowl night\" with a friend. We were going to get orders as takeout but were told that it was eat in only. I had just looked at their ad and on the page that gives their daily specials it says takeout just above the specials. I said this and the manager said it didn't say that. I really don't care for being called a liar. So for the food I would give it a 4 rating but the service and attitude from the management, only a 2. Oh, the waitress was great, she was only doing what she was told and left her a good tip. I don't know who this place was sold too, but the management has the same crappy attitude. Change the advertisement if your not going to follow it."}
{"text":"The food is and always has been AMAZING!!! I LOVE all of the food I get here.(only place I feel safe trying something different each time) The prices are fantastic as well. For food, prices, and atmosphere you definitely get five stars. I only have three stars because of one of the waitress/bar tenders. Always overwhelmed (even if there are only two customers), not very attentive AT ALL, and a little on the rude side. After a long wait she brought out my friend's drinks, but not mine. She apologized and said she would return. After an additional ten minutes, I finally approached the bar and had the bar tender get me a beer which I then paid for. I returned to my seat and she now tries to bring me the beer I had long waited and already purchased at the bar. I told her I no longer needed it because I had to go the bar and I already paid for a beer. She kept telling me it was already on my bill and I said no, take it off, I already bought a beer. Finally, after a little back and forth she walked away with it... I was actually shocked. Of course I will be back here, we love this place. But maybe talk to your employee..."}
{"text":"They pour a fantastic Guinness,  and the everything on the menu looked amazing. I went with \"This Little Piggy\"  a spicy, pepper jack burger piled high with bacon, pulled pork and slaw. I know that I'll be coming back for more soon."}
{"text":"Solid place.Good wings ,pizza,burger,fries. French dip is my favorite there. Good prices on the food as well. Gets a little loud during the games but that's what happens everywhere during sports games. Great staff who are very attentive and pleasant. My only hangup is that this place would be even greater If they had some higher end drafts on tap. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for good food at a good price."}
