{"text":"We had bun bo hue and pho and cha gio and it was bad, I would not recommend coming here, so many other choices in the area, don't bother with this one. Service was terrible too, our drinks didn't come out till well after our food despite us asking many times. No water refills after asking many times.

Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"So Montreal has a Chinatown (or Chinablock according to some), a dense area full of shops and lots of restaurant that can look all the same to the outside observer.  Chinatown is a bit of a misnomer as well since there is a good bit of Vietnamese food mixed in and this is where I ended up.  Walking up the road looking for food a friend and I spotted a place with a lot of reviews in the window.  Some were even in English which was nice.  We sat down after a bit of a wait (a line seemed to form and disperse over and over again here, it is quite popular).  

The menu seemed to have a lot of variety though the 3 main categories were soups, noodle bowls and rice.  We stuck with the noodle bowls and I ended up getting the pork.  The sauce on the pork was very good, much better than what came on the chicken.  The rolls were excellent, I would be temped just to order the rolls with my noodles next time and skip the pork.  Service was fast, we got our food quickly and were in an out in under 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Great location with so much potential, but we were left unimpressed.  It's mainly for non Vietnamese. The flavor was a bit muted.  The rolls were unimpressive.  Maybe it was just their off day, but we should have trusted Yelp. When going for Vietnamese food, read the reviews of Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Not sure why I decided to try this place.  I didnt give it a worse rating because Im assuming maybe the pho is good but when I went it was way too hot outside to want some pho. I ordered \"fried chicken\" with rice and imperial roll plate. Ive never really seen a vietnamese restaurant that served fried chicken so I assumed it was probably just the traditional Vietnamese grilled chicken. Instead I got some overcooked oven roasted shredded chicken. Had almost no seasoning. Came with rice and a side salad (a piece of iceberg lettuce) and a decent really big imperial roll. Very uninspiring meal. Was not satisfied at all. If you decide to try this place stick with the pho."}
{"text":"I have to give it up for this place, it has the best pho in town! I was for the longest time a big fan of My Canh in Chinatown which is a block up the street but then I've decided to try that place when I saw all the reviews on the window. I was not disappointed! Me and my boyfriend always have the same thing when we go there: The pho with beef and the n41 (which the owner keeps saying it's his specialty along with the pho) and we leave the place always satisfied. The flavour is there for both. I haven't tried anything else on the menu so I can't really tell you much about it but these two options are definitely a safe bet. Perfect for a chilly day in town and it's also not expensive...25$ with tip. The owner is cool too which makes it even more enjoyable...one thing though: don't go there for the atmosphere as there is none but hey you can't have everything..."}
{"text":"I come here exclusively for the rolls that I haven't found elsewhere - the deep fried rolls with RICE wrapper, and RICE pancakes w/ pork & coriander.   I am gluten intolerant and these are such a treat! 

For phó and bún (vermicelli bowl), I go to one of their neighbours, My Canh, just a few doors north."}
{"text":"N°1 ou N°41?
Essayé à la sortie du Comiccon, nous avons été bien déçus mon conjoint et moi. Je n'avais pas très faim je me suis dit que deux rouleaux de printemps (5$ les 2 c'est assez cher) suffiraient, avec un jus d'ananas (de l'eau avec des glaçons et des morceaux d'ananas). Ça suffisait en effet, mais le goût n'était pas là. Je ne mange pas de coriande donc, les rouleaux de printemps étaient fades. Par la suite, j'ai entendu la dame d'à côté les demander avec de la menthe, comme je pensais que ça se faisait à la base, mais je ne savais pas qu'il fallait le demander... L'ananas était bon dans l'eau mais je suis reparti assoiffée finalement... Les vermicelles de mon conjoint étaient eux-aussi fades, même avec les sauces.
Il n'y aura pas de prochaine fois pour nous."}
{"text":"We passed by this restaurant while walking through Chinatown and decided from the clippings in the window to come back for lunch the next day. Very VERY glad we did. It reminded us of one of our favorite restaurants back home, the late great Cafe Dalat. Warning: no ambiance here, just very good Vietnamese food at a very good price--one of the cheapest and best meals we've had in our travels through Canada this summer."}
