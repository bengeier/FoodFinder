{"text":"Awesome food and staff ! Don't listen to the bs - it's must go to place ! We go all the time. You want to add or change something to your meal ? Just ask them !"}
{"text":"Came here not expecting much but was delightfully surprised at the enormous veal sandwich. Th sandwich wasn't soggy at all,  had a generous amount of toppings, the sauce was perfect and the bun was fresh and crispy. Going back soon to try the pizza and gelato!"}
{"text":"Surly service cost this lovely and tasty sandwich shop 2 stars. No one wants to be barked at by a rude staffer when they order. It isn't endearing or interesting. Smiling, greeting customers and speaking in a friendly manner would have been fine with me. I wouldn't recommend as I don't enjoy this type of experience."}
{"text":"We had dinner here 11/7/14, what a breath of fresh air. The staff are polite and attentive, the food is really good, it's clean and they even noticed I was overcharged and approached me with the $1.75 (which they got to keep btw).
I love sandwiches, what guy doesn't after all, they take their time, its all fresh, the bread is good and its well worth the wait. 
Kudo's to the owner and staff.....well done and thank you."}
{"text":"Duddddddeeeeee.... 

A co-worker of mine mentioned this place, but at a different location and apparantly they are starting to pop up here and there around the GTA quite a bit. Now i've been.... and I understand why, in fact the 2nd time I went there it was super busy! However I ordered ahead of time and was quickly given my food, cashed out and went home to enjoy what I now consider one of my favourite sandwich places within 30 mins of Newmarket, its the sauces and the fresh bread that really bring the goodness, also the massive portion size and very fair pricing is super helpful too. #winning"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of San Francesco Foods Veal sandwich so I decided to try out this location while in Bradford. The veal sandwich didn't disappoint. It was huge and tasty. The staff was very friendly and courteous. Unfortunately I have to take off a couple stars because I had a hair in my sandwich, a long brunette one. I thought I got it out when I noticed it but later I had a tickle at the back of my throat so I probably missed one or part. Can't tell if the hair was from the server or it was already in the veal but they need to be more careful. I would have given  a 5 star rating otherwise.  I'm hesitant but I will probably try it again since I frequent that area."}
{"text":"The veal sandwich is pretty good. Was not dry and the peppers were pretty good.
It's the place to go for local veal sandwich"}
{"text":"Okay is the best way I can describe this place. I'd wanted to visit since we moved to Bradford about 2 years ago, and perhaps I'd been so anxious to eat there, I set too high standards. But really, the sandwiches are just 'okay'. The Pizza (we didn't have any) looked dry as hell. And the prices! The sandwiches are very big, which is probably how they justify the price, but when you consider the price to add any additional toppings and cheese, it's too much - especially since the sandwich was only okay. I had the beef and my husband had the veal. He didn't even like mine at all. 

I probably won't be going back unless it's to try the gelato."}
{"text":"The \"Kari's Karrot Soup\" as they call it was a natural winner. It is a travesty that they only have it for the month of February (for Bradfordlicious). Had the Cacciatore, Pepperoni Slice, and Small Gelato Combo.... Just AMAZING. Going back again for sure!"}
