{"text":"I've now been to Casellula a handful of times and I've waited until now to post a review. So far, it has never disappointed. What a great addition to the northside! Delicious and eclectic selection of cheeses, paired with interesting condiments -a particular favorite was a Rogue blue cheese paired with a brown sugar fudge--the perfect accompaniment to the robust red wine we ordered. The cheese plates are executed and presented by a knowledgeable fromager, who walks you through the pairings and informs you about the cheeses.  It is an education for the diners, but done with a light and charming hand. 

Over the course of a few visits we've had a chance to sample nearly everything on the menu. There isn't a misstep. It's actually hard to pick a favorite because everything is so good. Particularly noteworthy are: the octopus, served on a bed of white bean puree, perfectly cooked every time; artichokes with romesco and prosciutto and the roasted beets with labne, cashew and microgreens. The salt cod fritters are also not to be missed--crispy on the outside, light in texture with a wonderful briny flavor.  Save room for dessert--they are all delicious, but the panna cotta is a knockout. Kudos to Chef Andrew Hill on a great menu, very well executed.  

The wine list is perhaps the most interesting in the city. They've got an extensive selection by the bottle and a nicely curated by the glass list. They've got a great beer list, both bottle and on tap, as well. 

On two occasions there have been jazz performances in the main section of the restaurant. The first time, a Friday night, the atmosphere was very jazz clubby, which was fun. The second time (a Wednesday) the performance was a more \"sit and listen\" so conversation in the restaurant was more subdued.  In both cases, the music was great and added to our enjoyment of the food and wine.  

Several of the reviewers have noted issues with service, to be expected in a new restaurant as the front of house finds their legs. Over the course of several visits we've seen the problems shake out. Service as Casellula is understated, gracious and attentive.

As an aside, I've also had the pleasure of dining at Casellula in New York City. It's a terrific before or after theater choice. The atmosphere is bit more cozy, perhaps owing to the low ceilings and low lighting and, as a result, it feels a little more intimate. The menu offers the same type of small sharable plates, but different choices, except for the Pigs Ass sandwich, which appears on both menus. Casellula NYC offers but the same attentive service, the same great cheese.  

Casellula Alphabet City has become our \"go-to\" restaurant.  The best new opening in Pittsburgh--amidst a bunch of great options--in quite some time. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I can sum this up pretty easily....its just \"fun\".  NYC vibe.  We let the fromaliere (sp?) select 6 cheeses to start.  Excellent!  Enough for 4 of us to share.

Table tried 4 of the various craft cocktails...again all excellent...so we all got seconds.

We had 2 of the small plates and then 2 of the mains - overall was very good and there was plenty for the 4 of us to share.

We already have plans to go back with some other friends!"}
{"text":"Unique experience! Food was excellent and our server Alex took great care of us. 
In terms of the picture; starting bottom left and going clockwise: 
Burrata, Mac and Cheese, Octopus and selected cheeses to end the meal with a bottle of Californian Cab Sauv."}
{"text":"Service is extra friendly, helpful and unpretentious. The snacks were delicious. We had the pickled carrots and marinated olives. They have an expert on cheese that prepares the cheese plates and will pick ones for you to pair with whatever you're drinking. The tables are configured such that you arent bumping into others and they make the most of the space they have. I do think they could rearrange the seating, hostess station and cheese station at the entrance to make for better flow, seating and less confusion."}
{"text":"Relaxing Evening Tickling the Taste Buds
Spent a perfect night of catching up with a friend over plates of different cheeses and wines. The server was a huge help in recommending combinations to try and we trusted his judgement and were extremely happy. The fun part was taste testing little bits of each cheese and trying it with and without its exotic side garnish. One was served with tomato jam, another with lemon curd, and others with olive oil pistachio butter, blood orange carrot marmalade, pistachio brittle, and red wine shallots. The whole evening was an experience for the taste buds."}
{"text":"This place is a lovely, interesting place for Pittsburgh. Very good craft cocktails, great wine selection, huge CHEESE selection. Lovely small plates - I especially like the octopus, the salads, the artichokes and sun chokes. 

It does get busy, so you might want to make a reservation on the weekend."}
{"text":"2 is a stretch, but the cocktails and wine were great. Overall just really underwhelming food. I can understand the price points being higher due to the no tipping policy, but the food wasn't great. Okay at best. It felt inaccessible and snobby and for being in that location, that's surprising. Wouldn't recommend it. Pretender not contender."}
{"text":"Opening night at Caselulla and you can definitely tell they are working out the kinks. Much smaller space than I had anticipated. Red sheer curtains separate the bookstore from the restaurant, so if there is an event at the bookstore, the restaurant guests can hear it and vice versa. The cheese is $6 for two pieces with each cheese paired with accoutrement per cheese. I wish the menu would have more descriptions about the cheese, as the staff had no clue what any of the cheeses tasted like. The staff seemed to be lacking in terms of being able to describe the wines as well. The least expensive glass of wine is $12, so a night of wine and cheese will cost you a pretty penny. Also, I had to ask for water three different times. Plates are small and pricey for the portion size. I actually like the bar seating better than the actual table seating. I wish them well as being located in an otherwise dead zone of the North Side, but time will tell."}
{"text":"What an absolute delight! My husband and I dined here last night on a last minute recommendation. We shared two cheeses, the baccala, and the monkfish. Well prepared and presented! The sauces with the fish dishes were outstanding! The service was perfect! The jazz trio added to  a most lovely atmosphere! We will return!"}
{"text":"Casellula is phenomenal! The setting may be a little awkward during quiet events because half of it is City of Asylum/ a book store. The dessert and drinks were extraordinary. It is a little pricey but at the end of the day it comes down to quality and service. Everyone was very welcoming and they don't take tips! Definitely a great small business to support."}
{"text":"Such a cool new spot in the Mexican War Streets. We had the best night there, and plan to return again soon!"}
{"text":"Great place with a great vibe. A new northside destination. The fact that they share a space with Alphabet City makes this place even more special.  Food was great and the staff was attentive and professional.  I will be back and so will any one that loves good food."}
{"text":"Visiting for the first time.. its important to know the outside lettering is \"City of Asylum and \"Caseullula\" is displayed in a much smaller style.   I was looking for \"Casellula\" since this was my first visit.   Off street parking wasn't an issue nearby on a Thursday evening at 5 (they open at 5).  No doubt one of the coolest places I have patronized in the burg.   Wine/cheese/plates - small dining area and bar - adjacent to a stage/reading area and library of books which I understand is a bookstore (non-profit).   We tried the \"House made Pickles\" green tomatoes - fresh and delicious.  The \"Greens\" I really liked this salad and soon as I saw \"escarole and blue cheese were part of the ingredients I was sold.   I could have ate several bowls of this salad - quite exquisite.  \"Mac and Cheese\" came piping hot and ideal serving size for 1 - or possibly two if you are eating other items..  It was small side.   \"Beef Cheeks\" was my favorite dish of the night.   The beef and polenta was a match made in heaven and my taste buds were singing.  

I was in the mood for a stiff drink and love tequila so the bartender recommended \"Beyond Wild\" Cocktail which was tequila, mescal, lime and coconut. .. very refreshing and hit the spot!   The prices are above average - which is expected but worth it. 


I definitely want to head back for a reading and explore more.   Thanks Caseullula"}
{"text":"Love love
Love! So thrilled this is in our neighborhood! We had a wonderful evening before heading downtown! Food was excellent! Service was great!!! Congrats Casellula!"}
{"text":"Well.. this morning i read that Caselulla is closing on December 23rd. I went here for my first time on Thursday. Thursday's offer is half priced bottles of wine over $50. Our waitress suggested a sparkling red and it was delish! My friend and i tried an ounce of cheese and we split a snack plate and the chicken plate. The chicken was AMAZING!  We ate it so quick that i didn't even have a change to get a picture! I'm going to leave this review short since they only have 5 more days. But if you are around the north side, you definitely need to check this place out! It will be sorely missed!"}
{"text":"My home away from my AirBnB while in Pittsburgh. What a wonderful place to stumble upon around the corner! Predictably entertaining...one amazing documentary screening and one live show that had my head be-bopping all night long, even after hitting the pillow. I recommend the mac and cheese...decadence with every bite. Literally no diminishing returns. Oh, and the wine and service were fab, too! Where else can you find highly knowledgeable and absolutely lovely (unpretentious, attentive, polished) staff who all have a smile on their face that lights up the perfectly/dimly lit room. Thank you, Mr. Keyser, for being such a great host for this Brooklynite. High praise!"}
{"text":"Caselulla is a very awesome experience. My girlfriends and I spent 4 hours here, one hour was sitting down with the owner learning his story and what brought him to Pittsburgh. The food is really good, fair prices, and the servers really know what they are talking about. I loved the unique dining experience! No tip need as he pays his employees a fair salary with benefits! Definitely check out the steak tartare, it was SO good!! All of the cheeses and pairings were fun and flavorful. I wouldn't pass up this cool new spot. The ambiance is incredible, especially being attached to a book store!"}
{"text":"Went there this past Friday.  At this point they've been open about three weeks.  The renovation is pretty phenomenal, it's a gorgeous space with huge windows looking out onto North Avenue and the park across the street.  

We didn't have a reservation, but the staff took it in stride and put us in the soft seating area for cocktails for what turned out to be a very short wait for a table (less than 5minutes). You could tell by the staff's behavior that they're feeling their way, but everyone we came into contact with was friendly and accommodating, and seemed to know their shit.  No one was frantic as they moved tables around to accommodate groups of various sizes, etc.

We started with the marinated olives and the peppadews, which were stuffed with mozzarella and wrapped in speck.  I was expecting them to be a cold hors d'oeuvre but they were served hot, and they were delicious.

Instead of the bigger plates, we next opted for the shared tapas-style plates: terrine, artichokes, greens and octopus.  The terrine was a very fine pâté indeed.  The artichoke hearts were lightly dredged and fried and served with a nice romesco.  We were both expecting the greens to be cooked, for some reason (like, we didn't read the description!) but it turned out to be a salad of greens with shaved fennel and a little red onion and a perfect dill vinaigrette.  The octopus was one nice-size tentacle char grilled, on a bed of white bean purée.  I can take or leave octopus, but this was cooked just right, not chewy at all, but moist and meaty, combining well with the purée.

Next we went for the mixed cured meats to go with our cheese course.  Each of the five cheeses we chose was served with an accompaniment.  There was only one we thought mismatched:  a soft ripened cheese with a tomato jam side.  Both were delicious, but to us, the jam was too powerful for the funky cheese.  Other pairings were a bleu d'Auvergne with chunks of brown sugar fudge.  We were reticent, but it was actually quite a nice combo.

Prices did seem a little high for the alcohol--$8 for a draft... but otherwise, for a non-gratuity establishment, the prices for the food seemed appropriate.

The North Side needs places like Casellula.  I hope they succeed and bring in other businesses, of all price points, to the area.  They should definitely expand to offering lunch and brunch!  The space is beautiful, sophisticated and not overly pretentious.  The staff were friendly and attentive, almost to a fault.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is fantastic. Had a custom cheese plate, eggplant meatballs and tuna bruschetta! Wine list is great and the sommelier was there to guide us and help us pick. The had a great live jazz band playing. My only two minor comments is there is no parking anywhere I had to park 4 blocks away. Plus it is pricey !! And with the area that it is i feel like those two issues will be a problem for many people in my neighborhood. I will go back but only for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I had a nice time at Casellula. The small-ish restaurant is attached to alphabet city and it would be cool to come and check out the bookstore as well. Like all city places, parking is at a premium but I didn't have too much trouble finding a spot a block away. 

I made reservations for 5:30 and initially thought I wouldn't have needed them but the place filled up pretty quickly so I was glad to have made them in advance. 

We just came by for drinks and small bites before a concert so I can't comment on the full menu. We didn't sample any cheese, but the set up really looked amazing. I would definitely try that next time. 

I had the malbec wine on tap and it was delicious. The pour was very generous, in a large glass. Probably equal to 1.5 glasses at other restaurants. For bites we shared the peppadew, the polenta with beef cheeks and the arancini. Everything was really tasty and our server, Ryan, timed everything will which was what he recommended (that we choose some things and let him time them appropriately). The peppadew was a standout -- a really wished the serving came with more! The arancini was also delicious -- much more flavorful with a strong balsamic taste that was different than arancini I've had elsewhere. 

A couple of detractors -- the chairs were REALLY uncomfortable. They were really small (I'm a small person) and the back was pushing into my back at a really strange point. I wouldn't normally notice or comment on stuff like that but it was annoying enough that I noticed it. 

Lastly, it's a bit expensive. But there is no tipping, which is reflected in the price; so I felt that it was reasonable. I would be willing to come back and pay higher prices to support a good wage for the staff."}
{"text":"I love Casellula. Everything about it is wonderful. Service, food, ambiance, drinks, dessert, and the little attached bookstore. They even have jazz on certain nights and it is lovely. 

You definitely have to order a cheese plate at Casellula. Every single time I've been there we have asked them to create a plate, given them our preferences, and than have been astounded. The cheeses and unique accompaniments are a true pleasure. 

Besides the cheese plates, I've *loved* the eggplant meatballs and Mac and cheese (accidentally ate meat in this one, but it was worth the accidental taste and is highly recommended to meat eaters). 

I've only had one food item that I wasn't *impressed* with and it was some type of fried potato thing that could have been served anywhere (I.e. McDonald's). I don't want to compare Casellula to McDonald's, but I basically ate a mediocre hash brown. 

I don't know if I've ever experienced such attentive, yet, not annoying service. Everyone who works there seems to have an extensive knowledge of the food and drinks, and they are polite without being cold. 

Even when I take into account the hash brown disappointment, Casellula is a five star place. It's easily one of my top ten favorite places in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The food was good, but of course being \"small bites,\" I left a bit hungry.  I thought the cheese selection was quite good, and the cheesemonger seemed to take a lot of pride in the variety and presentation of selections.  

The service was pretty good (despite the public insults of the owner about not being able to find any good help in the North Side of Pittsburgh!)  I was very disappointed in the wine list, though.  For a place that touts itself as a \"wine bar,\" I thought the wine list was completely unimpressive.  As someone who appreciates good wine, I could not find a single bottle of it on the wine list.  I saw a lot of $10 wines being sold for around $50, but I did not find a single bottle of wine that was actually of a high caliber.  Just because they charge a lot of money for a cheap bottle of wine, doesn't mean it magically becomes a quality bottle."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with some friends. The food was excellent. Atmosphere was great. It was busy but not annoyingly loud. Minus one star because my husband said service wasn't good, but I don't recall that it was bad. The Spaghetini was by far my favorite dish. I didn't get to try any of the cheeses, but they have an amazing selection. Would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Very cool cheese focused restaurant/wine bar housed with a non-profit bookstore and reading/performance space. 

First off, they have the best cheese plate in town.  I made a custom plate of Harbison with Valdeon (Spanish Blue), and it was delicious. I paired that with a nice Tempranillo wine.

For an entree I chose the polenta, which was delicious.

Here are the positives. You would have to go to New York City to experience anything similar. This concept is popular there, and I'm pleased they are trying it here. The food is wonderful, and the cheese selections are extraordinary.

On the negative side, they just opened. The staff is still being trained, but they are learning fast. For example, I got a short pour on my wine, clearly not the 5-6 ounces the owner intended. I pointed it out to the owner and he quickly remedied the issue. 

It's a small plate concept, so expect to order multiple plates. They also do not accept a gratuity, similar to Bar Marco and the Livermore.

In all, a great spot for dinner and conversation."}
{"text":"Owner Brian Keyser thinks Pittsburgh servers are untrainable. I was a big advocate of Casselula and was sad to hear they were going to close at the end of Dec but now I think good riddance. https://www.tippedoff.com/single-post/2017/12/04/Brian-Keyser-Interview"}
{"text":"Cheese and wine!  What else needs to be said?  The place is nice and not pretentious.  Everyone, including the owner, is cool and helpful with the menu.  We have been a couple of times and have enjoyed every visit.  Of course we get a cheese plate but have been trying all the other things on the menu.  Get the octopus (yeah, I was thinking what? when I first ordered) - it's delicious!  The wine selection and drink menu is fun and the bartender is great.  Cool place!"}
{"text":"I almost hesitate to give a 5-star to a place that I have only dined at once and only sat at the bar and had a glass of wine and a dessert.  But here I am, doing it anyway.

Casellula is a bit of a hidden gem, because it is actually located in a larger space, Alphabet City/City of Asylum (I'm still unclear on the relationships between each). And Alphabet City is located in a larger building structure where part of it has been under construction apparently forever, and on its end is an abandoned adult movie theater.  Once you find it and step inside, however, you're in for a real treat.  It's bright and open, but after dark can feel cozy and intimate at the same time. The restaurant is on one side of the space, a book store is on the other, and in between is an open area with a raised stage and some couch seating.

It was happy hour, so we sidled up to the bar and ordered a glass of wine (me) and a cider (my date), and we split a pistacho tart.  We sat and chatted for awhile before wandering over to the books with our drinks (totally cool) and exploring what was on offer.  The wait staff was all very friendly, and one guy even gave us the background on City of Asylum and its mission.

My date and I are big fans of good cheeses, so I have a feeling that we will eventually be on a return visit to have an encounter with their house Fromagier and go on a journey of cheese. I also noticed that there is a brunch, which I immediately shared with two of my girlfriends that I go to brunch regularly with.  I really look forward to returning, for any occasion!"}
{"text":"This might be a new favorite of mine! The cheese tasting is to die for. The cocktails are fantastic. Our server, Joyce (?) was fantastic. We had an awesome anniversary dinner with complementary champagne. We are already talking about going back! My fiancée got the veal dish and it was delicious! I got the Mac and cheese and it was also excellent. I will most likely get the veal dish next time, simply because it was more my taste. The blue cheese from Vermont is a MUST!"}
{"text":"This is a great space and unique concept with delicious food and drinks to boot! It's a restaurant, but shares a space with a book store/artists space, which we loved! Every dish we had was fantastic- cheese plate, beets with yogurt, eggplant meatballs, and bacon-wrapped sweet peppers. The night we went they were having a film showing so you could eat and watch the film or go downstairs- very cool! We opted to go downstairs so we could talk normally. Our sever was very knowledgable and attentive. He was able to speak to everything on the menu and made great recommendations. Overall, this place was great and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I am probably biased to like this restaurant, as I'm a big fan of City of Asylum and I want any War Streets business to do well.  That being said, I was delighted by my first visit here last week and I expect to come back routinely.

Lets start with the space: it's beautiful.  The former masonic hall has been lovingly restored into a space shared by this restaurant, a performance space, and the City of Asylum bookstore.  Tall ceilings, big windows, and beautiful finishes make this space peaceful and gorgeous.

The food is excellent as well.  The cheese focus that other reviewers have mentioned is clear from the big cheese case that greets you when you walk in.  The cheese selection was varied, and included my favorites from Jasper Hill in Vermont.  The rest of the menu is small plates, all of which were balanced and well-executed.  My group of three shared a cheese plate, polenta (amazing beef cheek melts in your mouth), cod fritters, and the eggplant meatballs (such good texture that it fooled my husband into thinking they were made of meat!).  Their beer selection was good, the wine list was fairly conventional and overpriced for the offerings.  This is my reasoning for docking them one star: if you're going to be a wine bar, you can't just give me a $14 glass of the same wine I can buy at any store for $16 a bottle.  Either lower your wine prices or up the caliber of bottles that you are stocking.

Service hasn't quite hit its stride yet, with our waiter overly attentive at first and then nowhere to be found towards the end of the meal.  I'll forgive them this as they are still a fairly new restaurant and were fairly busy on the Friday night that I dined with them.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Service simply odd. Some prices way out of whack. (But gratuity is included in price,  so that accounts for some of it )    Portions range from minuscule to regular.  Maybe we are gauche but absurd absurdly small portions are just not a good thing   Went here 3/5.  Its bright and minimalist but with interesting design. It's not a particularly warm place.  The menu is broken into \"snacks\" small plates and entrees.  We got one $9 wine with a tiny pour.  It was the cheapest wine on the menu. The waitress gave us water and left us alone for a few minutes. She did mention cheese. Here's the deal:  they have a frommagier or some such term. Like a sommelier of cheese. The waitress told us that each cheese was 6$ for 2 oz and the cheese person. Would choose accompaniments and help us choose the cheese.  We thought we'd get to talk to her before she chose/recommended cheese but no.  The waitress said we had better get moving on ordering cheese because the frommagier was backed up. A while After we told waitress that we wanted 3: one blue, one mild and one they could choose the cheese woman brought them to us. The blue was paired with brown Sugar fudge and the combination was lovely. The mild one was kind of a bore and  paired with I think carmelized onion  and the Third was a Swiss. 

We got 4 small plates:  eggplant meatballs in a sauce involving harissa The sauce was also
Slightly sour.  Three large eggplant meatballs with the texture and appearance of real
Meat. They were the best vegetarian meatballs I ever had.  3 large codballs in a garlic aioli. Piping hot. One member thought that they did not taste like fish.  The other disagreed but they agreed they were delicious.  Sun chokes in a very good cheese crust were nice and flavorful but the potatoes were undercooked!  We were quite surprised given the aims of the restaurant. Grilled artichokes with s nice smoky flavor and a pimento tasting sauce were tiny and delicious. 
 We ordered 2 entrees:  beef cheeks with creamy polenta were perfectly cooked and delicious. The waitress warned us that the $17 Mac and cheese was small. Boy was it ever. And rich. Ditto. It came with carmelized onions and we requested no lardons. The Mac desperately needed some acidity-a bit of greens perhaps?  Sometimes the server was there. Sometimes not (The thing with the weird cheese delay was just weird). A couple of male servers just stood around.  I'd say it's not the most friendly place.  So go here and check it out."}
{"text":"I had a super great experience here. In fact this may become my go-to wine bar! I love the dual use of the space. On one side it's a bookstore appointed with stylish mid-century furniture. The other side is the restaurant/bar. This side is smaller and more cozy. They weren't able to seat me at a table since they were fully booked for the evening, but I found a spot at the bar. James, the bartender, was fantastic and super nice. Very warm and welcoming. He recommended a drink not on the menu and it was delish. If you want a great tasting cosmo, have him hook one up for you! He might even tell you his secret which I won't spill here. Casellula has a real chill relaxed vibe. The noise level is perfect and didn't interfere with conversation. Would say it's more for a mature crowd. The bartender mentioned that they have live music during the week and definitely want to check that out! 

After for food I had the cod fish fritters and chèvre. You get three ample sized fritter balls. Great for sharing. This first visit set a high standard. I'm a fan!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our experience here. We did a bunch of small plates and a bottle of wine along with several cheese selections. They had a really great wine list and we enjoyed everything we ate. The only quirk was that they didn't really tell you how the cheese side of things operated. We were sitting there for a good 20 minutes after we finished the rest of our food still waiting for the cheese. They do have one person slicing and putting together all of the plates but they should do something to streamline this process."}
{"text":"If you think a bottle of wine and 5 ounces of cheese is a bargain for $84, this is the place for you! Add in a waitress with little knowledge of wine and/or cheese trying to rush you through you choices, well, you're gonna love this establishment. 

Set between a derelict adult movie theater and a methadone clinic, the ambience of this bookstore cafe is aspirational at best. 

Let me sum up: the okay cheese is $6 per ounce, ergo, $96 a pound. I don't know about the rest of you, but I can think of a whole lot better uses for my money."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It's a really cool space that has a bookstore, a stage/lounge-y type area, and the restaurant (with, most importantly, a really big bar). 

My husband said the eggplant \"meat\"balls were \"one of the best foods I've ever eaten,\" and he doesn't give praise like that easily.  We had a chef's selection of cheese, and the pairings with various garnishes were fabulous.  I had a veal agnolotti that was a bit decadent but hey, I picked it. 

The service was great - props to the bartender John, who made thoughtful wine suggestions at each step of the way. 

My favorite aspect of Casellula, aside from the great food, is the overall vibe.  It's hip without being aggressively hipster.  The crowd was great - everyone at the bar was sort of engaged in group conversation from time to time.  The decor is a refreshing change from the filament bulb/steampunk aesthetic it seems like every other new restaurant has.  It's just....cool, man.  

(Bonus:  there's also a reallllllllly great-looking private party room downstairs.)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. After all, wine and cheese is speaking my language. It was obvious on opening night that they have some initial hurdles to clear including use of the space, staff knowledge, menu, wine selection, and pricing. The bar is quite nice although not very large. The table seating was packed as a lot of anxious locals showed their support for a much needed business offering. The floor to ceiling red curtain separating the bar from the event space next door does nothing to make this a quiet, peaceful space where you can relax, enjoy some wine, and have great conversations with friends. The TV in the adjacent space could be heard distinctly in the bar as could the activities there. I can imagine that at times this could get very annoying. 

I'll give them a pass on some of the service issues including how to run a credit card. First night is a tough one. The food menu had some interesting options and the cheese choices were diverse. The wine, however, was not what I had hoped for. The selection of wine was nothing distinctive and were things you could pull off the shelves at the state store. I would hope they expand that selection to more unique offerings. That seems to me an easy fix. Pricing is very high even given the no tip philosophy. $14 for a pour of a wine I buy for $12 a bottle is unsettling. Perhaps they will feel their way successfully through this area as well. 

I applaud their leading effort to bring some class and culture to the blighted Garden Theater area of the Northside. I'm anxious to check back in the near future to see how they've progressed."}
{"text":"Our reservation was for 5:45 (3) people. I paired the Love Stout Beer with the Cowboy Coffee dark&smokey . The popcorn that came with the cheese I didn't care for. Nevertheless , the Shares portion of the menu is not as much food as you would imagine. We received 3 cod balls which were excellent but one of the guest I was with decided she needed to go to Wendy's or Trader Joe's to get more food. Our service was rated a 3 as they forgot my cheese and our order of marinated olives. For 3 people our bill was $70.00 for 3 (1oz) cheeses, olives, cod balls, 2 beers and 1 wine. Take it all in and enjoy the people you are with. Love life."}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I've had in Pittsburgh! Casellula has \"Fromagier\" or Cheesers that understand how to create the perfect cheese plate. (The book I found at the City of Asylum called How to Create the Perfect Cheese Plate was written by the owner!) The cheese pairing was incredible. We started with the Cowboy Coffee and ended with a variety of French cheeses paired with sweet toppings and a glass of Reisling.

The star of dinner was the shared plates. They have large portions that we shared among 3. Try the salt cod (Bascula?), the Polpette  ( eggplant meatball), and the Arincini (rice ball). Like, I can't pick! Delish!

Don't forget to order drinks.  The bartender was perfect and wanted to impress us!

I'm def headed back! It's a 5 star!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this past Saturday evening, intrigued by the Yelp reviews and the unique description of their menu.  I had only small plates of the Mixed Cured Meats and a 5 fromage pairing sampler, selected by the fromagier.  Along side from their by-the-glass list was a Tuscan Sangiovese, followed by a CA Tempranillo blend.  

The meats and cheeses were all outstanding.  The wines were mediocre.  The overall service was good but not great, although the fromagier was a standout.  

I'll probably visit again and see what a full meal experience is like."}
{"text":"Service here was what really pushed this to 4 stars. And since I'm late writing this review I can't remember if his name is Ryan or not :( but I think Ryan. He was wonderful and had the best wine suggestions.

Anyways, came for a birthday dinner for the Mozz Monday where they make the mozz at your table. The cheese was excellent but I will say for the price you barely get any cheese. My favorite home town Italian place serves fresh mozz made in house for the same price and you get way more cheese. We also had eggplant meatballs that were kinda disappointing. But the pasta and Arancini were delicious! I was bummed because the polenta wasn't on the menu and that's what I had originally wanted. 

I would definitely go back for the wine and maybe next time just stick to a cheese tray."}
{"text":"This is easily my new favorite spot in Pittsburgh. Great wine, intriguing cheeses and unparalleled service."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must!  The dining experience is so unique and unlike any other restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The restaurant shares a space with City of Asylum which made for a neat atmosphere but the dining space is still pretty intimate.  

My husband and I started with a plate of five cheeses so we could try one from each category and we let the the Fromager choose the cheeses for us.  All of the ones we tried were awesome, even the one \"funky\" cheese that we went out on a limb to try!  The cheeses each come with their own pairing.  All were awesome and enhanced the flavor of the cheese.  The whole experience of learning about the cheeses and trying cheeses unlike ones we have had before was so fun!  We ordered the small meat plate to go with our cheeses and all of the meats were delicious.  After the cheese and meat, we shared the Beef Cheek plate and a dessert (I can't remember the name but it had hazelnut and cream and was sooo good!)

I highly recommend checking this place out and being open to letting the Fromager pick the cheeses for you!  I am already looking forward to our next trip back!"}
{"text":"I love wine. Let's get that out of the way as a disclaimer right the heck now. It doesn't matter what kind (recently anyways; my tastebuds seem to have changed in the past monthish). Anything is fair game!

And this restaurant? It appeals to all of my wine love.

It also appeals to all my cheese love. I love cheese. I don't think it requires the level of disclaimer I gave above; but nevertheless....giving it anyways!

I went in specifically because I had a coupon for a free glass of wine. I ended up eating dinner and having a chessboard of 3 for dessert.

The dinner was amazing; I had the beef cheeks at the suggestion of the bartender. They were some of the best beef I've ever had!

I do not remember the cheeses I had (they have a lot to choose from); I only remember that I asked the bartender to pass along that I typically enjoy Brie and cheddar cheese; and something along those tasting notes would be preferred. He did; but somehow a strong Blue cheese still appeared on the plate. I didn't pass along my dislike of blue cheese; and that's on me. So I ate it despite wanting to gag.

Overall, this visit was perfect for the experience I was looking for; and I can't wait to visit on a night they have a presentation/speaker on the stage."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for brunch in Pittsburgh!  We were a group of 6 friends that brunch around the City every month.  It was my turn to choose the restaurant and I cannot have been happier with my choice.  Great food, great space, great cause.

We were seated at a table in the window of this trendy lofty place looking out onto the Park on a cool and sunny autumn Sunday morning.  The staff was very attentive and knowledgeable.  We had a 3 cheese plate as a starter.  The portion of our entrees and sides were generous and reasonably priced.  With many appealing options it was not easy to decide on just one.  All 6 of us raved about our meals!  I savored every last bite of my Eggs in Purgatory.  I hope this restaurant does well so I can return and try my second, third, and fourth brunch entree choices. 

It is places like Casellula that put Pittsburgh on the radar of national foodies and make me fall more in love with the food scene here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is permanently closed. Last date open was Dec. 23.  Closed on relatively short notice."}
{"text":"I was very underwhelmed by Casellula, but probably because I let my expectations get pretty high. 

Arrived on Thanksgiving Eve with two friends. We were seated after the host looked at their reservation system (even the place was barely 1/3 full). We decided on a bottle of sparkling rose, which was promptly brought over. The waitress tried her hand at opening the bottle (for the first time, nonetheless), the cork popped and the rose exploded all over the floor. I soon found out that the rose was all over my trench coat (a gift from London). The GM came over quickly with club soda and his business card so I could charge them for the dry cleaning. 

After that fiasco, we ordered a cheese plate and basically let them choose the specific cheeses. The plate was great, but it took about 40 minutes to arrive. Completely unacceptable in my opinion. We planned to stay for dinner, but after all of our bad luck we figured it would be best to dine elsewhere. 

Would give Casellula another try but my expectations are much, much lower. 

Side note: the coat turned out to be just fine, no dry cleaning needed"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh really does have an incredible foodie scene and this newbie ranks very, very, high on the bucket list for ingredient driven fashion forward ambiance dining. Fresh from NYC comes this Restaurant which made my literature and foodie self WOW!! The wine and cheese selections are extraordinary, the Merry Go Round goats milk Brie was oozing creaminess.  The pate melted in my mouth with its velvet texture. My favorite was the octopus, succulent being prepared with a three part process leaving this fruit-de-mer a must enjoy. Finishing with in-house, fresh baked pastries, I tried the pistachio tart with lemon curd and my mouth popped umami. A final thank you to Plamen Krastev for incredible service and sharing some foodie tips and laughs along the way! Can't wait to come back! Five stars plus from a very discerning diner :)"}
{"text":"Ok, I feel bad that the ratings for this place are a bit low.  There are several reviews and ratings that were made on opening night. Seriously people, do you not understand that no restaurant, including places like Lidia's and Eleven, suck on their opening night. Do you also realize that your asinine reviews on said opening night actually hurt the business on social media. Ranting aside, this place is legit. The space is unique, comfortable, and not overly noisy like most. The service is awesome, the cheese plate is the best in town, and the terrine is outstanding! The wine list is decent, prices are ok,  but they do seem to give you a 4 or 5 oz. pour, which is not acceptable (this comment is meant for mgmt)   Great place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"We visited on their opening night after discussing this new wine & cheese bar with a fellow Yelp buddy. The space is intimate and really cute and it was pretty packed for opening night. They share the space with Alphabet City that is an event space and a curtain wall separates the bar so noise filters over to the bar area. They're located on the corner in the old Garden Theatre block. 

The nibbles they offer looked pretty fun. Lots of cheeses, olives, pickles, and munchies like grilled cheese to choose from. The wine by the glass list looked decent but somewhat overpriced. I ordered a glass of Albariño for $15 then when I saw the bottle realized I've bought this wine a couple of times for around $12. My husband said similar things about his red. Clearly this area needs some work. Wine patrons will always Google any wine they like to see how much it costs - fact!

I'd love to see them succeed in this cute little space   The concept is fantastic and clearly they will have tons of neighborhood support. They just need to step up their wine game and either serve what they're currently doing with more realistic prices or get better wines for their current price points."}
{"text":"The food was good but for 110$ I walked away hungry. I understand that you keep ordering more plates until full. At this  cost it would have taken $500 for us to be full and there was only two of us. I hope they are successful because the area needs it but may have to incorporate some more  substantial menu options."}
{"text":"Wish we had made it to the restaurant earlier in their existence. Understand they are closing this upcoming weekend. Everything we had there was excellent!"}
{"text":"Interesting space that has the event space of City of Asylum connected to the main floor bar and dining area.  Stopped in for a bite to eat and listen to a reading.  The place was actually not noisy and when the reading and speakers started the dining area got quieter.  
I realize this place has not been open long so they need to work out the kinks.  Our server was very good but new and could not discuss the items on the menu but was willing to get the person in charge of the cheeses to discuss the cheeses.  So we ordered some wine and looked at the menu to get some lighter items.  We decided to try the Peppadews and some cheese.  We selected 3 cheeses that come with a small accompaniment.  The Peppadews came out in a reasonable time but the cheese took over one hour.   When the cheese server came she described the cheeses and the accompaniments...one of the cheeses we ordered they were out of, so she substituted something similar. That was OK but she probably should have asked first.  She also gave us an extra cheese that was one of her favorites due to the wait.  The cheeses were delectable and we really enjoyed the tasting with the accompaniments.  Each cheese was $6.
Would like to see some connection with some of the wines & cheeses so we amateurs could try to pair the wine with cheese.  Thought the wines a little on the expensive side.
Looking forward to coming back and trying some other items and cheeses. 

This is a none tipping restaurant, so the tip is included in the price."}
{"text":"I love all things cheese.  Seriously - the more cheese the better.  When I heard about Casellula I couldn't get there fast enough.

My friend and I each got 2 cheese filled items off the menu - I got eggplant meatballs and grilled cheese.  Every.single.morsel was scrumptious!  The grilled cheese came with a small side salad which was perfect.  I would have had plenty to eat just ordering one or the other - but...for lack of a better explanation - Cheese.  I needed cheese.

I am eagerly awaiting my next reservation - i look forward to trying the cheese plate and all the other yum on the menu!  Go!"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend for dinner on a Sunday night. We were seated right away. The selection of wine and cheese is outstanding. There is nothing like it in Pittsburgh. Highly recommend the arancini and peppadew peppers. Also ordered the muscles, tartare, and cavatelli. The cavatelli was the best of the three, but they were all on the salty side. Overall, the service was slow, but they were knowledgeable and friendly. Several times we had to wait for water and drinks and it was not crowded. We really didn't mind as we were enjoying each other's company, but I thought it should be noted. We will definitely come back again to try some of the other dishes, but we will ask for no added salt."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  After drinking and eating at Casellula at least five times; with the last time being met with complete rudeness and lack of hospitality; the unwarranted pretentiousness has this restaurant off my list."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place (a very rare for me) 5 stars, because I just can't find anything bad to say about it. When you walk in the door you're immediately face to face with the gorgeous selection of cheeses and their pairings. You're greeted warmly and ushered to your table, and your coat is whisked away. Your waitress is super knowledgeable about the wine list, and when you give her a brief description of what you like, she immediately has a few suggestions, and lets you try them before committing to the bottle. She remains attentive & friendly without being overbearing for the whole night - somehow she just always seems to be there. You have her select the 5 cheeses and pairings to start, and she does a bang up job. She helps you make your meal decisions, patiently describing the dishes that intrigue you. You choose the Octopus (cooked perfectly: I've never had Octopus that tender!) and the Pig's Ass Sandwich, every bit as good as she claimed. You order a second bottle of wine, which your awesome waitress once again steers you toward, and it's even better than the first (& not just because you've already had a bottle!). You finish with a decadent chocolate cake. You leave full, pleasantly wine-buzzed and eager to return. That's a promise."}
{"text":"My favorite place for cheese and a lovely glass of wine. They also have an awesome brunch menu on the weekends. Get the Pig's Ass sandwich! Their cheese plates are top notch and very thoughtful."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in an area of town that is being revitalized. Very interesting cheese selection and lots of wines to pair. Can't wait to check out the brunch that just started Labor Day weekend."}
{"text":"Food was great! The cheese course was a long wait but very much worth it. Unique and very cute."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe this place exists in Pittsburgh let alone the up and coming North Side. Finding a home in the City of Asylum, this fine dining experience pairs wine and cheese to the \"T.\" But fear not, all ye who don't possess an inner cheesemonger...there are elegant juxtapositions of flavors and textures to be had that are less cheese-centric. The peppadews \"snack\" were simply delicious and the spaghettini \"plate\" was surprisingly rich and full of flavor. And who needs dinner conversation when you dine on an evening of jazz and spoken word in all languages but English!  We could've used more attentive service in the unique, tidy space. Just go and cross this one off your list!"}
{"text":"Didn't get past the eggs.

This space is really nice the open area is very bright and there is a bookstore on the other side with a lounge in the middle. I was looking for some good eggs and this place was recommended . I went in and was greeted immediately and sat at the bar. 

This was during brunch and I was pleased to see \"cheesey eggs\"  on the menu. I also ordered a mimosa which was a little pricey at 12.00. The eggs looked great but was very deceiving. First the goat cheese was very bitter and unbalanced the dish. Second the salt was a thick flaked salt and I had big chunks in the eggs that crunched. It was a hard salty blast that was un welcome. I could not finish it and left to have eggs somewhere else."}
