{"text":"This place rocks! Five stars. They have 8 sandwiches, and 3 of them are vegan. The pizza swirls are THE BOMB. Amazing deserts as well. Everything is made in house. No bullshit ingredients. Throw in some good indie background music and that completes the package."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Excellent lunch spot. I had the polpetta pizza swirl, meatballs with red sauce rolled up. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I recently hosted a luncheon at Cafe Benice for a group of friends.  The owner (Evan) was great to work with - very flexible with all my requests.  

All my guests raved about the food!  Don't miss their spanakopizzas and the quinoa salad. Great dessert selection too.  I will be back!"}
