{"text":"I had been meaning to try Estia for awhile. The interior looked so elegant in photos that I was excited when my friends agreed to have our New Years Eve dinner there. Unfortunately, Ive never had such a disaster of a dining experience in my life...

One of our friends had to leave early so we made the reservations for 5pm (right when they open). Needless to say it was empty when I got there. When making the reservation, I had requested one of their posh godfather booths. The waitress was very accommodating even though we were only a party of 3. She did inform me that a large group would be arriving at 6.45pm and requested that same table. We agreed however that if our dinner took a little longer we would move to a smaller table for our desserts/coffee. 

I arrived on time as I normally do and waited for about 10 minutes for my first friend to arrive. As the hour approached 5:15th...things got weird. The waiter was getting very anxious and pissed that we had yet to order anything but since our third dinner companion was running late we didn't want to start without her. The manager (I'm guessing that's who he was) stopped by our table to AGAIN give us a heads up that they would be needing the table at 6:45pm and we were welcome to move to a smaller table if need be later on. 

So I'm very puzzled as to why when 5:20pm approached and our last friend arrived the waiter became aggressive and pushy for us to order even before we were able to say our hello's. The hovering over the table and tension was palpable. It made us all incredibly uncomfortable but we tried to not let it bother us. We ordered our drinks right away. When the waiter came back to take our food order 3 minutes later we were reminded yet AGAIN that they would be needing this table for a 6:45 party. They created the most uncomfortable and unwelcoming experience Ive ever had. You would have thought Barack Obama were arriving after us. This is how nervous, tense and hostile the environment around us became. 

The waiter was unprofessional for many different reasons that I won't even go in to. I don't think he has the necessary social skills for this kind of job. He was saying and doing awkward things (like putting his hand on my friend's plate to remove a lemon wedge). It was just very strange behavior. 

The manager didn't have the proper people skills either when we told him how unwelcome we were feeling. We skipped our last dish which was taking forever to come out of the kitchen (which makes no sense if you're trying to get us out at a certain time) and just asked for the bill. We were gone before 6.45pm and they got their precious table back. 

It was the most unprofessional and absurd service I've ever experienced to date. I'll be curious to see how long this place runs with this kind of management and staff."}
{"text":"For all of you who wrote that this is an excellent, phenomenal, awesome restaurant...obviously, you don't dine out much.

Quite simply, if you're not filling up on all the bread shmeared in hummus and tzatziki, then you'll starve because the portion size of both apps and entrees are an embarrassment. Further, I NEVER mind paying exorbitant prices for my food if it's extraordinary. The food @ Estia is far from that wish. It was bland, forgettable and the waiter was daft. Correction: the grilled octopus was delish...it was also one bite. My Branzino was mushy, cold, and doused in an over compensation of oil. It was returned...twice. At that point, I walked out. 

I LOVE expensive excellent food. I love fancy obnoxious trendy restaurants. Estia fails on both counts."}
{"text":"The restaurant was phenomenal!  The service was great and had the pleasure of the manager coming out to walk me through some of his favorite dishes. I definitely agreed after eating them :)

For apps, we had the Octopus, Halloumi, and Calamari. Which were all delicious and started the meal off right! I mixed in a fruity salad which was a refreshing pallet change in between. Then we had the short rib, which was just unbelievable. 

Our server walked us through some wines to have with each dish as well!

All in all a great meal for a great price. I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Love Yorkville and this restaurant is a fairly new addition to the area.  Th decor of this restaurant is very simple and elegant.  

The food selection is a good variety for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian people.  

The half order of bread is plenty. The eggplant spread had a nice smokey flavour but was not overwhelming.  The goat cheese was delicious too.  The olives that were served with the bread platter were good.  My only wish was that they were pitted. 

The salads are fresh and serviced nicely. We tried orange salad and toasted marcona almond salad with watercress.  It was flavourful and fresh.  

The entrees are great. My husband liked the scotch and whiskey selection. The tortelloni was bursting with ricotta and truffles.  Very nicely served. 

Dessert is a must. The pistachio and pomegranate ice cream is amazing!"}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I visited Estia for dinner and we had a really positive experience. We ordered the rainbow bass, an arugula salad, the cara cara orange and red endive salad and a side of wood oven potatoes to share. 

All of the dishes are family style and meant for sharing. The rainbow bass was cooked immaculately. The fish was the most tender fish I have ever had! It was super soft and it easily fell onto my fork. The flavour was rich and flavourful even though it was only cooked with olive oil and sea salt. It was better than anything I have cooked at home. 

The arugula salad was my favourite of the two salads.  It features figs, walnuts, aged balsamic vinaigrette and we asked for the ricotta cheese on the side. The salad was savoury and the figs added an extra element to the dish. The figs were creamy, sweet and savoury.

The cara cara orange and red endive salad was okay. It was presented beautifully but it wasn't as delicious as arugula salad. The salad featured marcona almonds, saffron vinaigrette, and caper goat cheese which we had on the side. This salad was also much smaller than the arugula salad.

Last but not least the wood oven potatoes were delicious! They were seasoned with lemon and salsa verde; they tasted amazing! I loved the flavour and texture of the potatoes. The salsa verde left the potatoes with a delicious crunchy texture and I was able to pretend they were comparable to fries. 

Would we return?
Absolutely! We had a wondering dining experience and we sat on their patio. It was the perfect setting to enjoy a nice evening."}
{"text":"It is really hard for me to get excited over restaurants  in Toronto but Estia has won me over. Outstanding service and incredible food. I have really enjoyed all my meals here. In a nutshell, Estia has that Yorkville flare but they live up to the hype.

The vibe is romantic and cosy. The crowd is a mix; families, couples, the occasional basic \"in the six\" group, but still classy. The beautiful bar is a remnant from ghosts of restaurants past, Nao.

I would suggest sharing all the plates and although they specialize in seafood, I recommend trying some of the other meat-based dishes and various starters like the halloumi, calamari, charcuterie board, beet salad. The half chicken is outstanding --so moist! The agnolotti with truffles are not to be missed.


Our waitress made a mistake with my order, and the kitchen/staff rectified the situation despite the kitchen being closed."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks back with my mista and took my baby cousin out for some patio hangs and fresh birthday bites more recently. 

It is a beautiful space inside and out to relax and enjoy some elegant Mediterranean fare.   Whether you are sitting at the pretty bar; at the booths inside, upstairs, or on the urban oasis patio on Avenue, you will likely enjoy the space and ambience. The drinks are on the pricier side but with food and atmosphere this pleasant, you will be happy to slowly sip one and enjoy the moment. 

We tried the seafood linguine (Clams, mussels, cold water shrimp and squid cooked in a wood red cherry tomato sauce with fresh basil) and cavatelli (spicy n'duja ragu with octopus, San Marzano tomato, caper and olive). Although they were good, they weren't the highlight for us. Props for giving the option to order half portions on the menu, though. 

It was the creative salads and share plates that stole the show. They also have amazing looking fish you order by the pound; a meats & poultry section and a very appetizing looking dessert menu.  

Highlights:

The salad menu is dreamy! (see: estiatoronto.com/Estia-D... - I would like to try most of them)

The portions are generous: a $9 \"half portion\" easily serves two while the whole versions ($17) can serve 4.

I loved the Asparagus salad (Roasted and raw, tossed with hazelnuts, parmesan and sherry vinaigrette) Tasted what you wish healthy food always tasted like: fresh, light, bright and well-balanced in terms of flavours and textures. 

The halloumi is made in house and served with warm truffle honey, roasted grapes and toasted walnuts. A decadent treat to pair with a white or rosé.

The octopus is divinely brined in a red wine-orange mixture, lightly simmered and then hung over charcoal. It is served over romesco and n'duja. Loved this."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great and that was it for me... 

Way way over priced... 

Went on 6/9/17

1 of the waiters was awesome and the other one was rude and not helpful , my date even made a comment... 

We ordered the octopus app, half chicken and sea food pasta... 

octopus was good but the portion was super small, almost 1 tentacle

Chicken as meh 

I asked the waiter if I should get half or whole size of de a pasta... and he advised to get whole as small is too small... well whole is massive get half... my comments on dish, felt like a dish from Boston pizza... 

Will not return..."}
{"text":"Ambiance was great. Decor was beautiful.

Food was okay. We had a shared 4 course meal so a bunch of food came out. Out of it all, there were only two items I truly enjoyed... Octopus and the cod, both which were starters. Tried pretty much most of the sides and starters.

Had the snapper, lamb shoulder, and some other whole fish which were all okay.

Good experience  but not good enough for the price."}
{"text":"Came to Estia last night for a nice dinner.  Note that although all the online sites seem to show they have multiple Prix Fixe menu options, they do not have any!

Our server was very knowledgeable and guided us through the menu.  They had many fresh fish options and the list of fish available changes daily.  

Our meal for two consisted of the following:
1) Eggplant Dip
2) Peach Salad
3) Seafood Linguine (half portion)
4) Branzino Fish
5) Sides: Wood Oven Potatoes & Grilled Broccolini

The eggplant dip was really good - great flavor.  It was like a Baba ghanoush dip.  It came with pita and some deep fried bread.  Only problem was there was too little pita, and the deep fried bread was SUPER oily.  I would have preferred pita only

The peach salad was interesting.  It comes with boccocini, basil, and caramelized walnuts.  This dish does not have the best presentation.  It looks like a rabbid squirrel ripped apart the peachs and scattered it over the plate.  Literally, the peach is hand ripped apart, there was no knife used here or any fine lines, quite savage looking actually.  The walnuts are the star here...  when paired with the peach it's a great combination.

The linguine was marvelous, perfect al dente, with all the right flavours, and the seafood was done perfectly (clams, mussels, shrimp, and squid).  The tomato sauce was also really good - no complaints here, but the half portion is really tiny!

The branzino is a European sea bass, and is similar in flakiness to other sea basses.  The natural flavor is slightly sweet.  The fish was grilled well, however we had multiple bones that escaped through the deboning process!  Also, they forgot to provide the salsa verde seasoning so we had to wait another 10 minutes for that to arrive.  Our waiter seemed to have disappeared once a large table of 10 arrived with promises of a much larger tip...

As for the sides, the wood oven potatoes were amazing - crispy on the outside and roasted to perfection.  As for the grilled broccolini, I just found it OK.

All in all, Estia was a decent experience.  The patio is really really nice.  Service-wise, initially, when the restaurant was not busy, the service was very attentive.  By the end of the evening the server had moved on to the larger parties leaving us to try to flag him down on numerous occassions.  For me the food was a 7 or 8, with the standouts for me being the eggplant, linguine, and the potatoes.  The fish as good but not as great as I was hoping for, as this is their specialty.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Estia provided excellence from cocktails to dining; an extra bonus was the patio space with perfect people watching and delightful ambience for a romantic date. As a solo diner I took advantage of the half-size plate option and thoroughly enjoyed the octopus cavatelli which was perfectly spiced, the branzino and an arugula salad with house made feta. Bruce, my waiter, helped guide my choices when I requested and was attentive but unobtrusive. Reservations are recommended, especially on warm nights when desiring outdoor seating. Perfect for couples and groups."}
{"text":"Came with a friend for dinner and drinks. Service was alright. My server had a chip on her shoulder - could've been friendlier. We ordered the octopus, beef tartare, and the peach salad with burrata, to begin with and the agnolotti to share as a main with a side of fries. Our server recommended the half order of pasta, saying that it will be enough because we had ordered a few starters. The octopus was perfectly cooked however barely there. There was at most 2 bites each, if that. The beef tartare was a plate of lettuce. Couldn't find the beef. Not the same description as the menu. The peach salad with burrata was almost the same as the tartare. It was all mashed up peaches on a plate with scrapings of burrata. Both dishes the presentation was terrible. The half order of Agnolotti was pathetic. 4 pieces on a plate. Thanks to the servers recommendation, it was not enough. Didn't even taste truffle, it was so bland. The fries were probably the best thing I ate there, and it's a Greek restaurant. Also drank gin and tonics and they were nothing special at all. I would never go back nor recommend it to anyone. Waste of money. The decor was pretty. That's about it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most shockingly terrible service for a restaurant located in Yorkville. 

We came as a family of 6 and we all left angry and unhappy with the slow slow service. 

I would really like to figure out how their deployment works as it seems they have one waiter for every 5 tables and even if it was large tables that fit 10, and in comparison a whole lot more servers/cleaners who bring out the food and drinks. The waiters seemed over stretched and wait times are absolutely a night mare. On top of that our waiter wasn't even good. It took forever to get us napkins and almost 20 mins later of us on the lookout trying to wave him down to get our order placed. But when the food came a whole team would emerge. However this was done in a horrible way too. The table next to us had about 10 persons and our food and their food came out together except for the one dish, short ribs. 

We were all pretty much done eating and though out that time one of us sat staring waiting for the short ribs. The waiter assured it was coming but 30 mins later as everything was eaten up did it finally get delivered. The waiter apologized and blamed it on the fact that they only had one oven. Making one person watch everyone else eat their mains until they are done and now everyone has to wait for the one person to finish is simply unacceptable. The food was ok. Wasn't amazing. The short ribs was probably the best dish but not worth the wait. 

One of us wanted desserts and asked for the menu but in the end our waiter was so slow that we decided to skip deserts as it was already taking so long. We then sat there being ignored for over 15 mins when we asked for the bill. A manager finally noticed us constantly popping our heads up to look for help and we said we need our bill and he scurried away and a team of 3 servers came to clean up our table and one of them took our left over to pack but came back out empty handed to service another table. We sat looking around some more wondering when we will get our bill and what happened to our leftovers. At this point not only was I annoyed but the chairs was super uncomfortable for a high top patio chair as I have short legs and felt overstrained sitting there for over 2 hours. 

When we finally got to leave we were shocked to see it that they were empty indoors. There was no reason for the delay. Just horrible. Not going back. Wouldn't recommend. Stay away unless you want to just hang for 2 hours and don't mind slow slow service."}
{"text":"Been eying this place for a while and was thrilled to finally go for dinner. At first blush, ambience is extraordinary. Feels luxe and for a Friday was quite busy with people out to be seen, yet wasn't too noisy you couldn't hear your dinner companions

But things just didn't impress after that. Our server explained personal versus sharing sizes and based off his instructions we ordered accordingly. Big mistake. Personal pasta was small. Too small. And SO SALTY I just wanted to sit in a corner and cry (I was famished when I arrived). Couldn't eat it. Saw friends sharing salad which I should have gotten. My husband also orders pasta - family size as he was hungry and can demolish a big serving. There was nothing family size about the serving except price - at any other Toronto restaurant its standard size of a pasta dish (and were not behemoths! Just regular folk. Regular appetites). Both of us were disappointed. The eggplant appetizer was delicious although they don't bring you enough artisan bread to enjoy all of it. Cocktails ok, dessert ok. In the end the bill was over 120 and one of the unsatisfying meals in the city. Shame. :("}
{"text":"We decided to try this place last Monday night. I remember it used to be NAO steakhouse but now it looks like they have re-branded and serve Mediterranean seafood.

We ordered the in house made feta cheese, calamari, lamb keftedes, truffle pasta, yukon fries, and a grilled fish.

Our waiter was diligent and effective. I have no problems or issues with the service.

The food was m'eh. The feta cheese appetizer was nothing special. The calamari was good quality but nothing special. The lamb keftedes were fine but lacked any interesting flavor. The pasta was also good. Can't comment on grilled fish as I didn't try it, but it looked like it was cooked well and was very fresh.

Would I come back? I don't know. Maybe for the patio I would but not for a dining experience."}
{"text":"We had high expectations based on reviews and sky high prices (am I the only one who thinks $28.00 for half a chicken that does not come with anything is excessive. I assure you it was basted not with gold, but rather a ton of salt).  For a starter we ordered the eggplant and bread basket.  Once it was served and we noticed the eggplant came with bread, I said to the server had you mentioned that the eggplant came with bread,  we would not have ordered a basket of bread, she just shrugged her shoulders and walked away. She spent most of the evening ignoring us. Even when we told her a couple of times some of the food we ordered never came to our table, she acted with total indifference and did nothing, so we finally had to search out the manager, who was apologetic and tried to rectify matters. Food was mediocre and service and non existent. You can scratch this restaurant off your list of ones to try."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance! My girlfriends and I shared the fish crudo, branzino, agnolotti pasta, and beef short ribs. Everything was delicious and our server patiently explained the sharing style menu with us. We definitely went overboard with desserts, wanting to sample everything from the kataifi tart, patched plums, and chocolate torta, to the ouzo and vanilla bean ice cream, and grapefruit sorbet. 

Wonderful dining experience, will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience! Any dish with eggplant is superb, the fish is very fresh, great wine selection and staff is great. Being on avenue road it can be a lot noisy with the cars but the plants do a great job blocking the street. Overall, I would go back until I go broke"}
{"text":"Although service is lovely the food is sub par. Pub food at best for high dining prices a we started appetizers, fried calamari that was no better than something you'd find at a local bar, haloumi I could have cooked myself and flat bread that was good but not for the price.

Wine list was impressive.

My main was a tasteless seafood pasta with mussels and clams that tasted like they've been in the freezer for far more than a half portion for 20 dollars deserves. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Overall, an amazing dining experience. The food and service were exceptional (thanks Olivia). We went on a Friday evening and enjoyed the patio seating (can get noisy though with the cars). 

For our appetizers, we got:
- The octopus, which was grilled perfectly (ie, not rubbery) and the sauce was really tasty. Portions were a bit small though.
- The grape leaf wrapped feta with figs was interesting. A bit salty, but how it was put together was pretty and we love figs (biased us). And who doesn't love feta cheese?
- The bread basket (half portion), which was a very good size for 2. The melanzana dip, feta cheese, and olives were great matches to the different types of in-house made bread.

For our mains, we got:
- Sea bream , which was part of their daily seafood menu. You could really taste how fresh the fish was, and the simple flavour/cook highlighted that. There are choices for seasoning. With everything we ordered, 1.2 lb was enough for 2 people. We didn't order the sides since we had the pasta. 
- Seafood linguini (half portion), which had a good ratio between the seafood (mussels, shrimp, clams, squid) and the pasta. Also loved the cook of the pasta - perfect aldente.

For dessert, we got:
- The special, which was a cherry pie type phyllo pastry dish with marzipan filling, ricotta ice cream (made in-house). I found the pastry was a bit burned on the edges (bitter after taste) but my husband liked it. 
- Fig with honey and yogurt sorbet, which was a definite show stealer. Generous helping of figs, just the right amount of honey to give the right level of sweetness, and the in-house yogurt transported us to Greece. Delicious and refreshing.. .perfect!

Finally, Olivia's service was very attentive without being obtrusive. The menu was well explained, dishes and cutlery were replaced quickly after every course, lemon was provided with water, etc. 

I'm definitely adding this to my \"must go back\" list!"}
{"text":"Ambience, food and service was fantabulous. Definitely a new hot spot and a must try for anyone that has not been here! My favs of the night were the octopus, calamari, branzino and chicken. All the good had great flavor and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service ! Service was very attentive and informative-helped us with the menu. The food was yummy ! Started with the 1/2 bread platter for two...sooo good, and then one of us had the octopus (excellent) and the other had the tomato salad (very fresh). Then we each had a 1/2 fish and the cauliflower. All exceeded our expectations. So full of good food,we had no room for desert."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience here.
Started with a few cocktails, which were very tasty
For the apps got the half bread plate (there were just 2 of us dining) and the halloumi cheese -both were great choices. I really liked the sweet and savory aspect of the halloumi cheese. Then shared half the fresh branzino (around $30 for half) and half the calamari (also around $30 for a half order) and a side of the potatoes. It was all very tasty. Finished with a scoop of their homemade ice cream. The service was great too. Our server, Tessa I believe, was super friendly, answered questions and attentive. Plus, there were a few other servers checking on us, pouring water, etc. I would def come back here. Had a wonderful meal and experience!"}
{"text":"What a gem of a place! Our server (Kelly) was amazing-- I would go back just for the service but the food is also so delicious!
One of the very few places in Toronto that can grill an octopus how it's meant. The grilled branzino was brilliant-- simple and fresh and delicious!
Al fresco dining at its best, a great spot.
We cannot wait to visit Estia again!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a girlfriend on a Saturday night. I've been wanting to try this place since I heard that the old NAO got a makeover. Upon first impression, the interiors + ambience were truly fantastic - they did a great job! 

Unfortunately the food was only okay, at best.

Here's what we ordered, in the order that we received the food: 

Octopus: 7/10 - this was probably the most delicious dish, although it was very small and the flavours don't come close to the polipo at mamakas, or the more casual, pantheon.  Even restaurants that aren't known for their octopus have created more delicious dishes, Portland Variety and Jules' Bistro, for example. 
NB: the best part of this dish was the sauce it was sitting in - orange in colour and creamy in flavour. 

Clams: 6/10 - Overall, we found this dish extremely boring. I had to request the charred bread, which later came fresh, not charred. Whatever they stuffed into the clams and in the sauce was half cooked, so there was an unintentional crunchiness. Overall, very MEH. 

Celery Salad: 3/10 - quite literally, this was two to three celery sticks chopped up and topped with pine nuts. At first, my girlfriend and I laughed to each other, but this was an extremely sad plate. I should give the kitchen some credit, in that the pine nuts enhance the taste of the celery... but, really?! 

Grilled Broccolini: 7/10 - the broccolini was sitting in the same sauce as the octopus, which was probably the highlight of the night. It was well cooked, perfect amount of crunch, and the red pepper sauce (?) it was resting on top of was delicious. 

Braised Cauliflower: 0/10 - this was a complete joke. We had about two pieces and couldn't stomach any more. It was undercooked cauliflower in a tomato puree sauce. This dish initiated a ten minute conversation with my foodie friend on the value of cooking tomato sauces on low, for a long time. We agreed that it tasted like a cheap can of tomato puree was put in the microwave for 45 seconds and drizzled onto undercooked cauliflower; it was truly disgusting!  

Greek Branzino: 8/10 - Fresh fish! It was cooked with olive oil and salt. Again, this was delicious, but for the price you're much better off going elsewhere. 

All of this, + 1/2L of wine ran us $220 or so. Not a terrible price point, but we left feeling underwhelmed and slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"We had a family dinner with my little sister who may be the most selective and fastidious critique of fine dining I've ever met, and she left contented.

The Good:
- The food was freaking phenomenal!
- The service was almost as good as the food
- We sat on the Patio which was generously spacious and unique for the area
- the ambiance was in line with the price point. 
- they reserve seats inside for days which they have concerned that there may be inclement weather on the patio

The Bad:
- the handicap accessible restroom doubles as a storage closet which upset my 90 year old grandmother

The Ugly:
- The management failed to stop some people from smoking cigars on the patio which I felt to be incredibly disrespectful and definitely detracted from the experience"}
{"text":"...\"Consuming fish on a Monday is usually a no-no in my books. I fear that it's left over from the weekend supply, but the server assured me that it was just flown in. After finishing my Cucumber Gimlet--a crisp counter to the humid air--we ordered a selection of items. From the starters and sides, we chose the halloumi, baby gem salad, calamari, fries and braised cauliflower. Although prices seemed steep, the portions--coupled with the unique ambiance--justified them.

The halloumi, ($16) prepared with warm truffle honey, roasted grapes and toasted walnuts, was a standout dish. It was the perfect way to ignite my palate before the mains. My only complaint was that the truffle seemed absent. I can't get enough of cheese and roasted grapes since trying Campagnolo's signature starter. They still do it better. The calamari was lightly fried and beyond fresh as well.\""}
{"text":"For the life of me, I cannot figure out how this restaurant received great reviews let alone good ones.

Our family went to Estia to celebrate a special occasion and had the highest hopes for a wonderful evening.  What we received was anything but.

From the moment we arrived, it was the most disappointing experience.  We waited over 45 minutes to receive our cocktails and our shared appetizers took slightly longer.  The waitress clearly had not worked in a fine dining establishment and had trouble both taking and communicating our orders.

Two HOURS after we arrived (no, I am NOT exaggerating) , we still had not received all our entrees.  Worse yet, the portions were significantly smaller than the waitress described them and therefore, there was not enough food.  Our 1.5 lb piece of fish that we were told would be more than sufficient to share was actually so small, we left hungry.  The medium rare steak arrived well done, the short ribs arrived with little meat but plenty of fat and the second piece of shared fish never arrived.

Sadly, several supposed managers never once approached our table to help resolve what the waitress claimed was the fault of the kitchen.  Never once did any management offer apologies as we sat there wondering why we were being ignored.

Finally, after all the shunning and small portions and waiting and being disappointed, we got up and walked down the street to Morton's where we were welcomed, treated with kindness and respect and most of all, were fed.  Portions were plenty for sharing, our meat was cooked to perfection and we did not wait an unacceptable amount of time for the food to arrive.

The biggest slap in the face is that no sooner did we arrive home, Estia promptly sent an email survey asking for our opinion of our evening.  We immediately filled it out honestly and now one WEEK later, still no response.  

At least Estia is consistent...food and service took forever and obviously a response to the survey will as well."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been to in a long time. Estia gets tops mark for its dazzling interior, high ceilings, and delicious dishes. Tucked away in Yorkville, this romantic spot that serves Mediterranean dishes is known for its fresh seafood and daily selection of fish. It's by the pound by the way, and isn't cheap but well worth trying. 

We got a few plates to share. The waitress recommended we try the Halloumi which was a fantastic choice- cheese with warm truffle honey and roasted grapes. This is a mouthwatering appetizer and if you love cheese, you'll love this dish and start googling where you can buy Halloumi in Toronto (or maybe that's just me). 

For our mains we went with the Flounder seasoned with oilve oil and salt, the Seafood Linguine and the Roasted Chicken. The fish was delicious, well cooked and beautifully seasoned. Loved the seafood linguine! The pasta was more on the al dente side which I don't mind and it was a sizable portion. The chicken was good as well but we agreed that it was a bit on the dry side. Also wasn't crazy about the herb topping. 

For dessert we tried the walnut cake paired with roasted pear ice cream (tasted more like chai though). And also tried their pistachio and pomegranate ice cream (so delicious!) and the goat milk ice cream with caramel. 

All in all, very happy with our meal and the attentive service. It is a bit on the pricy side so it was definitely nice that they also offer the option of getting a 'half' or a 'whole' of a plate if you want to go and try a bunch of dishes. Would definitely come back for a special occasion!"}
