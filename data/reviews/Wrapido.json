{"text":"It's a challenge spotting this place as their isn't a lot of signage around. But when you do find it, Wrapido has the tastiest, fattest wraps of various styles around. Their product is just done right. The sweet Sri Lankan women that works there is a gem as well. They deserve their current rating!"}
{"text":"Wrapido is such an amazing restaurant. The wraps are great, the sides are awesome, and many more positive factors. What is even more amazing is that they prepare + make the dish right infront of your eyes! This way, you'll know it is fresh and steaming hot. As well, their prices are really good for the big portions they give you! It's wonderful and a place you should try out in the new future."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The place doesn't look like much from the outside, but the wraps are amazing. I've had the philly steak and California chicken and they were both awesome. I am not sure how they make any money with how many ingredients they stuff in it. For only $7.90, it's a steal!"}
{"text":"The only thing I have ever had off of the menu is the Roti, and that's the only thing I need.  The best 6$ you will ever spend, and even if you usehurrier it to your place in the downtown core for an extra $10 (which is what my best friend and I frequently do) still WORTH it!  I rarely eat Indian food because I don't exactly know where is good to go.  I recently tried The Host which was good; the Roti at Wrapido beats any Indian food craving I will ever have.  Not only is the curry filling so flavourful and the perfect amount of spicy, but roti wrap is the softest and tastiest thing ever.  I've never actually been to the restaurant; I was recommended by a friend who orders from them regularly!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, my favourite is definitely the California chicken wrap.. I've had every wrap on there at least a couple of times and I keep coming back for more!  I'm not convinced by the masala potatoes (too much turmeric and you could taste the rawness of some spices that had not been roasted enough) but other than that, every dish on the menu is a winner.  The 2 ladies who run the place are really sweet and pleasant too!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! Though you have to make sure they assemble the correct wrap, as I have often received my steak and cheese, sans cheese. A far better and competitively priced choice than the neighbouring subway and, more interesting than the ubiquitous Kabab establishments dotted along Bloor St."}
{"text":"Honestly probably some of the best wraps I've ever had. I went with the California chicken as recommended by some others and was not disapointed."}
{"text":"This place is great. I agree with the praise being thrown around. Just want to add that sometimes the contents of the wraps come out SO HOT that they are near impossible to eat. Do yourself a favour - either get takeout and let your sandwich sit for a little while to cool down, or cut it open on a plate. I realize this criticism is kind of petty, but I wish I had known before trying to eat one of these guys on the go.   Anyway, no other complaints here!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place quite a lot recently as it is SO good. The curry chicken wrap is possibly/probably the best best roti/burrito style wrap I have ever eaten. So tasty. The wraps are around $7/8 and are made fresh in front of your eyes in 5 minutes. Fantastic food, great price and quick AND healthy too. Would thoroughly recommend. Still wishing they were open weekends though. Still 5 stars though!"}
{"text":"Best wraps ive ever had in my life! The fish wrap was such a good deal considering the price of it.  A must have!"}
{"text":"THEY MAKE THEIR OWN ROTI-STYLE WRAP.  Best place in all of Toronto to get a wrap. California Chicken is amazing.  Only problem with this place is that they're closed on weekends."}
{"text":"Too bad it has closed. I think they were a victim of location because anyone I know who has gone there thought it was really good. Really nice lady who was running it. What a shame."}
{"text":"why?! why did it close?! Worst news ever :( Maybe it will reopen somewhere again? I am grieving..."}
{"text":"Wrapido is baaaaack! I used to eat here practically once a week so I was absolutely ecstatic to see OPEN on their storefront. What's new? All day breakfast, free WiFi and an expanded patio. Unfortunately, my experience today was a total letdown that I'm hoping was a fluke.   I wasn't greeted by the lovely, friendly Sri Lankan lady who used to always be there (though other reviews say she is still there), but by someone else. I ordered the California Chicken which seemed to be of similar gargantuan portions (for $7) and otherwise just as I remembered it, with one MAJOR exception. I found two chicken bones in my wrap, and I have only eaten one half of the wrap at the time of writing this review.   When I pointed the bones out to the lady behind the counter, she completely ignored my complaint and simply asked, \"Do you want a box [for my half wrap]?\" Seriously? Bones are a choking hazard in a wrap! No apology and you're not going to inform the man grilling/wrapping to be more careful? He can stand to be less \"rapid-o\" with the preparations. Also, the avocado was hard as a rock. C'mon Wrapido. Don't make me break up with you... :(   I'm willing to give it another shot (only if the awesome lady is there) and will be finishing the rest of my wrap in a well-lit room with my glasses on, taking teenie-tiny bites (because it's too good to waste)."}
{"text":"Rolls Royce of wraps for beater prices.  Pros: Valhalla for taste buds. Owner has no grasp of economics.  Cons: Not open right now.  Absurd: California wrap: grilled chicken, bacon, feta, avocado, fibrous greens, lemon aioli compacted into golden-ratio calorie cylinder... for $6 dollars  ¯\_(?)_/¯."}
{"text":"Rotis are still amazing and tasty.  However the prices have increased to $6.99 for a roti. A good value is the curry chicken which comes with basmati rice and a nice salad for $7.99.   Lunch hours are very busy and hectic which can mean waiting 15-20 minutes for your order."}
{"text":"/changes facebook status to 'in a relationship with California chicken wrapido'  Jesus on a pogo stick that was the best wrap I've ever but into my mouth. It's up there with the best anything I've put in my mouth and there's a lot of contenders!   The wrap itself is pure perfection and I noticed one of the ladies rolling fresh dough in the back. The chicken is perfectly seasoned, the bacon is cruncherific, and the feta cheese is the perfect binder for this dynamic threesome (throw in greens and avocado).   I hate half and am completely full. I'm saddened by this fact as I cannot wait to devour the other half!   So, so good."}
{"text":"I was in Kensington and needed something quick to eat. A quick yelp search returned this little gem around the corner. Upon entering the restaurant I realized how small it was - seating is limited- might be more of a take out place. I ordered the Califonria Chicken wrap based on the other reviews and I must say it was quite delicious. It was packed with ingredients and everything was fresh. I was very hungry when I went in but the wrap was filling. If you are planning on eating there, the fireplace is very nice on a cold day. No washrooms here. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Wrapido wins for the best wraps in Toronto!  It's a small little shop tucked away on Lippincott (beside Aunties and Uncles). Wrapido is like one of those shops that are easy to miss unless you're specifically looking for it. There is a very homey vibe when you walk in and it feels good to support family own and run restaurants. This is not a sit down place, they only have 2 tables and usually that's where people sit to wait for their food. It is, however, the freshest, most delicious take-out that you can really get.  The actually roti/wrap is made fresh - you can see them rolling out the dough as you're ordering. The fillings are also cut up on the spot and the meat put on the grill to order. Even though $7 may seem like a lot for a wrap, they are huge and very filling. (It's only $2 more to add a side of fries if you're a big eater - they're thin shoestring style fries and really delicious)  The California chicken wrap is my favourite and 9/10 times I will order this. It's comprised of chicken, bacon, avocado, lemon aioli, arugula and more yummy things freshly put together in a wrap! That being said, the Mediterranean, butter chicken (new on the menu, might have been for a limited time) and fish wraps were also tasty. The fish wrap is just deep fried fish and tartar sauce though so if you want your veggies, stick with other wraps.  If you live in the area, you will find yourself quickly becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"Super surprised. The place seemed a bit sketchy, and I've never seen anyone actually eating there (I live nearby) ... but, it was delicious. It was filling, it wasn't too expensive, and it did not explode in my hands as many a roti often do."}
{"text":"Website prices are outdated (as of time of writing wraps are $8 vs $6 on the website)  Wraps are huge and delicious. I could barely finish it, and I have a big appetite.   Got the tandoori wrap the first time. There was a generous amount of meat and quite a few veggies (mainly pepper and onions). The bread was cool too... I think it was Indian paratha  The second time tried the California chicken, which also was really good. I liked the combo of the ingredients, and again it was very filling.   Pretty close to a streetcar stop. Accepts credit card. It's a small place a little  outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Best breakfast wrap. Generous wrap for one could go for two. Fresh and tasty. Pleasant welcome. View of CNTower. Patio during warm weather. On Lippincott two doors north of College."}
{"text":"Stopped by again and not disappointed. The staff are friendly and the wraps are awesome. I had the California club with salad and could have packed up half the wrap for later. Super tasty, fresh and filling. Looking forward to the next visit! Nice outdoor patio as well."}
{"text":"EDITED REVIEW: THEY ARE OPEN AGAIN!!!! WOOOOOOO!!! This page needs to be updated. I think they closed for a month or two, but are OPEN AGAIN!!!   Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. Have come here more times than I can count, and am finally writing a well deserved positive review. Not only is the food substantial and delicious, but the service is the best you can get. I forget the lady's name, but she is co-owner with her husband I believe? She is incredibly friendly, I always look forward to speaking to her. Aside from the great friendly service, is the amazing food. My favourite wrap (As I have seen it is with many others) is the California Wrap. I have also tried various other wraps: The grilled veggie is great, as is the veggie masala. The fish and chips is also pretty good (I got some extra onions added to it), as are a bunch of other.   I tend to be quite picky when it comes to calling food \"great\" or re-visiting a place multiple times. I'm a student, so I also don't have the most $ to be throwing around on eating out, but for the quality AND quantity of the food, I have no problem dishing out the 7, 8, 9$ for a warp here that can easily suffice for 2 meals. The incredibly friendly service also just adds to it. I always leave with a smile.   OH and so much better than paying the 9, 10, 11$ for a (\"cheap\" SMALL!) burrito elsewhere. Here, you actually get REAL MEAT in your wrap, and a good amount of it! Unlike getting a burrito elsewhere, which is packed with rice and beans and other fillers with a small amount of ground beef. Why pay MORE money for a SMALLER wrap (with more fillers like rice), when you can come here and get a LARGER FRESH wrap that costs LESS with MORE actual meat and veggies!!!!  To the owners/lady who works there, thanks for not only making my belly happy, but also my mind :) I'll see you next time!  Oh, and forgot to add, the Roti is made fresh! Yum"}
{"text":"Was in the area, and looking for a place for breakfast. Found this quaint little place on a side street of college. The store is a small place next to Aunty and Uncles restaurant. I actually almost missed it because I thought it was the same restaurant.   Because it is small restaurant, the service there was great. It made you feel like you were part of the community (a regular). All I had to do was turn my head and she would help with me with whatever I needed.  The food was nothing to write about. Just a traditional breakfast joint that had eggs, bacon, etc. I was able to change the fries to a salad. The food was very fresh, and didn't feel like the processed food from the franchises.   Overall, I would go back again if I was in the area"}
{"text":"Really bummed out to see a \"For Rent\" sign hanging in the window. This place must have shut down over Easter long weekend and it's pretty sad.  I'm gonna miss those fresh homemade roti wraps and my egg, cheese & veggie masala wraps. *wipes away tears*  Seriously sad about this. A hidden gem"}
{"text":"You can certainly walk past Wrapido without knowing it. It's on a side street, tucked away in a corner with only a banner to show for it. Located beside Aunties and Uncles is this gem that serves a large assortment of fantastic wraps for only $6.00!!  Compare this with Subway, and we have a clear and distinct winner. I crave for these wraps. They aren't roti's, they are wraps which are portable and easy to eat (no fork or knife required). I love them because of the naan they use to encapsulate your pick of over 15 unique combinations.  My favourite is the California Chicken. A perfect mix of avacado, bacon, grilled chicken, Feta, Chedder, Arugala, Tomato, and lemon aioli. Doesn't that sound like the perfect wrap? Well, it is.  The Jerk Chicken wrap is also good, just a bit more saucy. The fries in the combo are thin and plentiful. Enough to make you wonder how you paid $7.50 for so much quality food.   The owner makes here naan every morning and serves them up through the day fresh to order. You have to wait for 5 mins for your food, but you can watch as she grills the chicken and adds the fresh ingredients to your wrap. It's not precooked!   Overall, I love the wraps here. I can't complain. The restaurant itself is small, has a fire place and wobbly tables but it really isn't about that when you come. It's about talking to the owner, watching her build your food, looking at her partner roll out the naan behind her, and finally wrapping your meal up for you."}
{"text":"Just happened to be in the neighbourhood and saw their sandwich board, so thought I'd give this place a try. So glad I did!  Probably the best wrap I've had (sorry Ravi Soups) - what makes the difference at this place is they use roti instead of your traditional wrap - so much better!  I ordered the California chicken wrap ($8+tax), all ingredients were fresh, perfectly balanced, and portions were generous. Service was quick, ladies were polite and I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"So glad they reopened,  I almost cried real tears when they temporarily closed. My favorite is still the veggie masala wrap and I also love the California chicken.  They do breakfast now!! And they're open 7 days a week! Go here now!!"}
{"text":"5 stars man!! This place is AWESOME. The ladies running it are wonderful: Kind and good at what they do. I've been trying to stretch my food budget of late and these wraps help me do it. They are so BIG I can stretch 'em out for two meals.  I am a vegetarian so have only tried the vegetable wraps. You know how you can get a wrap and know there are different shreds of vegetables inside of em, but not actually experience any of the individual vegetables? Well here, the vegetables are big and plentiful. I feel like I'm having a well rounded meal instead of disguised junk food.   I have tried both the grilled veggie wrap and the veggie masala wrap. Both are flavourful, filling and tasty. For people who do not like a lot of their spice in their food, I found the curry wrap to be pleasantly mild.  So glad I discovered this place thanks to other yelp reviews. Ya!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Fresh roti is made to order, friendly service and great prices. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"I haven't tried this location. I only go to the new location on Bloor Street as I work nearby here and I love it!   I tried the jerk chicken wrap, which I didn't like as much because of the way they marinate the jerk chicken. It is really saucy so it makes the wrap soggy. However, I did try the salad and added jerk chicken and it was delicious. The wrap I normally get is the chicken caesar wrap and I love it! The wraps are huge so you definitely need to be hungry to finish it. Even the portion for the salads are really big. You will never be hungry after finishing your food.  They also sell veggie samosas here for a bargain of 6 for $3. Not only is it cheap but it is also really good. it also comes with a chutney sauce that makes it even better! Even when I don't have lunch here, I will still stop by to grab some samosas."}
{"text":"Tried the Philly cheese steak beef wrap. It was huge! And extremely delicious, especially with the hot sauce. Great value for money, as I was not able to finish it and now will have it for dinner again as well. The service was also really good, as the lady behind the counter was very nice and friendly. I would definitely go there again, and soon, to try the other wraps that they have on the menu."}
{"text":"The service was lovely.  The food was ok.  My daughters poached egg was overcooked but they happily fixed that.  I had a California wrap which was ok.  My husband had a chili chicken wrap which was also ok.   The sizes were huge."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what took me so long to try this place. I'd see it whenever I went to auntie's and uncles next door but it wasn't until recently that finally tried one of their wraps. now I'm a regular at least once a week. my go to are the California chicken and the chicken curry roti wraps (both $8) but honestly folks you can choose anything on their menu and not go wrong. the portions are so huge that I dare you to try and eat it in one sitting. I'm also a fan of their veggie samosas and at 2 for 1 dollar you should be too. my only complaint is that they are closed on weekends but given that I'm already going once or twice week, that's probably not a bad thing. lastly the women working there are really sweet and friendly....it makes me happy to give them my business."}
{"text":"The veggie wrap is absolutely delicious!! The california wrap is also good, but I found it a bit too heavy. I will definitely go back to try some of their other wraps. This place is cheap, delicious, and has great service!!"}
{"text":"ThIs place is simply amazing! Several months ago, when I was told they would be closing I was sad and I thought they were closing for good. Little did I know it was only a temporary thing. Until they were completed with their renovations.    I stumbled upon Wrapido being open one day when I was hungry and happened to be on my way to Kensington... I was so happy to come back and order food on my way home.  My partner and I always used to come here and get great food. Initially we had discovered the one down the street from my house, at Christie and Bloor. Shortly after our first visit... that location closed and so we were forced to find the other location. To our benefit.   Diana works so hard and offers amazing food, wonderful and friendly service and a comforting atmosphere.   Honestly the chicken salads are incredibly tasty and flavourful. The wraps ate litterally freshly made from the dough to the chopping of the veggies. This is what makes the quality so superior to other places out there. And totally at an affordable price. You really get the biggest bang for your buck coming here.   My partner and I swear by this place. We have yet to try their breakfast but we are already sold on their wraps and salads. SO OOOOO GOOD!  I strongly recommend going yourself. Any of the Jerk wraps or the salad with Jerk chicken are a must!"}
{"text":"I came about this place by accident. I was in the neighborhood and needed some breakfast after a few tests. I was actually waiting for unties & uncles but they only take cash there...-and the queue was SO long, even on a Tuesday morning. I saw this place, and immediately went there. It was nice and empty, lovely patio. I sat there and the lady that took my order was SOOO nice. Just incredibly nice. I ordered the swiss and mushroom omelette. It was massive, it came with two buttered toasts and some fruit. The coffee is delicious. The staff was very kind and helpful. Just a wonderful experience. I definitely will be coming back to this place. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Please give me more chicken. Pleeaaassseeee. It was flavoured like a dream and I just wanted more bites of it in my Tandoori roti wrap. Life isn't fair and I just wanted to cry because I honestly felt there wasn't enough of it in my wrap. *Shakes First*  The filling was also layered a little strangely in terms of proportions; the top was basically all chicken, the middle was all the veggies, and then the bottom included a mix of both. Maybe I'm spoiled by eating too many burritos where all the toppings meld and mix together for a rather sensual experience, but yea, I was thrown off with how the wrap was ~engineered~  This thing was crazy hot, I grabbed one as take-out and had to let it sit for a while because I didn't want to burn my mouth off. AND, because of this, the fresh tomatoes they include in the Tandori wrap left part of my roti soggy and close to falling apart.  All in all though, it gets my 3 stars purely on flavouring and spice, because that wrap was seasoned near perfectly and it was a nice change from what I usually get as a quick bite. And points for freshness, these wraps are mad fresh.  Also...uhhhhh, don't come here for the Salad? I felt like I needed some freshness to go with my hearty wrap and grabbed a full sized Caesar, and they pretty much use kraft dressing and holy heck, my lettuce looked so sickly and limp that I was debating holding a funeral for it cause that shit was beyond dead. That was a deceased salad."}
{"text":"So good! Definitely dense and filling but really flavorful. We had the chicken tandoori and chicken curry wraps. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Awesome place! Great food and the owner is a lovely lady!! Everything here is delicious!  can't go wrong with anything you order. I usually order the Chicken Curry on rice with salad on the side or Chicken tandoori on rice with salad on side.  Their wraps are really good but I prefer the rice and salad combo instead.  Salad is very nicely seasoned and healthier choice.  Rice, not so much and they give a lot of it.  But, I eat all the meat and veggies on the top and a bit of the rice and the salad.   For the price, worth trying everything!"}
{"text":"I opted for a grilled veggie wrap for my first time here and it was delicious. The garlicky cream sauce on the wrap was soooo good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"DELIVERY REVIEW: via UberEATS  Wrapido = huge serving size (see wrap vs. ruler picture) and tasty at a great price.  When I received my order, I immediately thought of all my male friends who eat a lot saying \"VALUE.\"  Wrapido is no doubt generous with their fillings for their wraps. They were quite tasty although I was expecting something a little healthier. (They're more like shawarmas instead of wraps.)   The salad add-on (or fries) was $3 on UberEATS. It was a pretty lacklustre salad so I probably wouldn't order the salad next time.   California Chicken Wrap - great chicken, cooked well and not dry  - lots of spinach in it as well  Grilled Veggies Wrap  - eggplant was great - a little too oily for my liking  A TREAT YO SELF kind of food."}
{"text":"My favourite place! I go here about 3 times a week. The California is my fave and their most unique, but every wrap I've had has been delicious!! The prices are affordable the wraps are quite large and everything is made fresh for you. The actual roti is amazing and the people are always friendly. The only thing that sucks is that they're closed on weekends."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck is pretty damn good, well seasoned, generous portions for the $6 price tag. Tandoori chicken was great, if a little \"westernized\" in the spice dept. If you need a quick lunch/dinner in the College / Bathurst hood, go for it. Closes early though (8PM) and no weekends :("}
{"text":"This place is great value overall! The rotis are really tasty and you get a good sized portion for $5. I had the chicken curry wrap, which was well seasoned and generously stuffed with chicken, as well as the Philly cheesesteak wrap, which was pretty good even though it was made with cheddar (which I found kind of weird).  I was a bit disappointed by the dresssing on the greek salad (some kind of generic balsamic vinaigrette), and the fact that it cost a dollar extra to get it with the combo. Other than that, everything was great."}
{"text":"Best Wraps in town!   Hands down, no questions asked. They have the freshest, most delicious wraps. They offers a few other things too but I've only tried the wraps. Reaaaaallly good!  Unfortunately they're not opened weekends and they only have a couple of tables so it's mostly a takeout place - but still worth 5 starts!  BTW, the portions are HUGE! This coming from a guy who's not easily satisfied."}
