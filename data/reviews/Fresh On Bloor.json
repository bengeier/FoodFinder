{"text":"Have had better experiences at Fresh. Busy location, good with service. However, the food was really lacking taste this time. Ordered the quinoa onion rings (5 stars as usual) and the Dragon bowl (3 stars). I've had the bowl before and it was pretty disappointing this time. Wayyy too oily and about 70% just noodles. Assume they use a standard recipe so not sure why...stick to the onion rings."}
{"text":"It might have to do with the fact that I was eating out with one of the happiest, sweetest people I knew, so everything tasted great and everyone seemed nice. It was unbelievably busy at 6:30 even on a Monday! I wish it could be a bit more spacious. It was loud as well. I was glad we got a table tucked away by the window. Great place to people watch! Bloor has always been an interesting street. Great location, right next to the Spadina TTC and streetcar station.

I enjoyed their energy \"bowl\". I ordered the baby size and with soba noodles-- it was delightful."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious, healthy food.    A bit pricey but worth it.  Brunch is my favourite.....mmmm, pancakes.  Miso gravy is to-die-for."}
{"text":"I feel that Fresh is a good restaurant whether you are vegetarian/vegan or not (full disclosure I am not!). 

Overall the food is tasty and (mostly) healthy. I find my self ordering Fresh when i don't feel like preparing food at home. Personally, I find the portion sizes to be quite large and I often have difficulty finishing all my food. Typically I order one of their burgers (as a wrap - I can never finish the bun) or the squash tacos. 

I have also tried a few of their juices/smoothies (radiant green, immune boost and energizer). Although the juices/smoothies are very tasty - I personally don't think that they were worth the price. The major ingredients can be found on the menu and it very easy to recreate at home if you have a decent blender. If you are absolutely dying to try one of their juices I recommend taking advantage of the weekday special were from 2:30-5:30 pm you can order a 16 oz drink (normally 8.50$) and a treat (strong recommendation for the whoopie pie) for 7.50$.

I do find Fresh a bit pricier than some of the other vegetarian restaurants I have tried, but I feel it is worth the extra $$ every now and then because their recipes are so good.

Normally I order take-out, but I have dined in a few times. Eating in house is not too bad if it isn't busy (but be warned it usually especially for brunch on weekends and dinner time). However, when it is busy the restaurant is very crowded and can feel claustrophobic. Also it is very loud when it starts to fill up - it can definitely be difficult to carry on a conversation.  

Overall, I found the service to be pretty good. All the employees I have interacted with have been friendly and helpful. I will continue to order take out but will likely avoid dining in - perhaps I will have to try out the other locations."}
{"text":"I can't afford to go here every week because of their prices but when I do I am not disappointed. Great quality food that tastes delicious."}
{"text":"Fresh is truly vegetarian paradise. 

If you've ever suffered from the misconception that veggie food has to be bland, boring or repetitive, Fresh will quickly disabuse you of that notion. There's an incredible variety of burgers, wraps, salads and noodle or rice bowls. Everything is tasty and flavourful, made with fresh ingredients and a heap of creativity. Don't miss the sweet potato fries with a choice of homemade dip! The smoothie selection can sound a bit health-food, but if you're not in the mood, they also serve up local craft beers and a wine selection. Vegan and gluten-free options abound, too! 

The prices aren't dirt-cheap but they are reasonable. The service is fast and friendly. The tables are quite close together, but that's just a function of this place's popularity; they're trying to accommodate as many people as possible. My only 'complaint' is that the portion sizes are enormous! Luckily, they'll be happy to wrap up your leftovers to go."}
{"text":"Can I just say that this place is overrated? I've been here a few times and have tried the hamburgers, dosas, and a few salads (particularly the all star and california one).  The food is pretty bland unless you drown it in sauce.  The hot sauce is actually unbelievable but otherwise, the food itself is just mediocre. On the plus side, portion sizes are massive, and the servers are friendly. A tad bit too loud, however.  the place always seems to be packed with people waiting in line.  My advice? If you're looking for a \"delicious vegetarian meal,\" this ain't the place."}
{"text":"This place is great! Now that le commencal is serving dead animals, there is no question that my consumer dollars will be spent here at Fresh more often! I love the generous, healthy and tasty food! Clean and reliable, delicious and consistently perfect! No wonder this place is always packed with satisfied customers!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. I go to the one on Bloor and Spadina.  Good fresh food. I love the Burrito and the beach bowl with soba. I also love the cold pressed juices. JCC members get a discount on take out! Nice little bonus. I recommend if you don't mind a really loud and bustling environment."}
{"text":"I loved this place. They have great good and awesome juices. For the people complaining about the price, that's what you get for buying fresh food that's not full of preservatives.
Been here twice already and will gladly go back.
I only wish they had stores that were not all in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Fresh is a self proclaimed \"modern vegetarian\" restuarant with four locations in Toronto. All the locations are busy practically everyday since it opens to when it closes. They also do takeout but no delivery and have a juice bar. I have been a few times and really like that they are open to customizing the dishes, and that the bowls and salads are offered in two different sizes. The menu is large and most of the items are very healthy and use a wide variety of  fresh ingredients making them nutrient diverse and dense. Not to say that they don't have a selection of unhealthy picks.. Their fries and onion rings are both fried and they serve alcohol. This restaurant is a great way to introduce yourself or a friend to vegetarian cuisine, as there is something for almost everyone no matter what their dietary preferences are."}
{"text":"I was wondering what all the hype was about this restaurant. I went here just yesterday and it was a \"meh\" for me. 

Ambiance:

Very crowded - don't expect to have conversation in this restaurant. The tables are also close to each other. 

Food: 

They really know how to work with veggies. I got baby dragon (the smaller version of dragon) with soba noodles but the soba noodles just didn't work with miso gravy for my taste. The zucchni and tomato tasted so good but as for the noodles and tofu, it was really mehhh and trust me, I love soba noodles and tofu, just not at Fresh. 

I also tried the  Sam Houston burrito.. I didn't like this one as well. After I took two bites, I didn't want anymore of it. 

Service:

Mediocre.. very mediocre - the server wasn't that attentive because the place was crowded.

Probably will not return here. I tasted better vegetarian food."}
{"text":"Ok, having a huuuge menu to choose from is pretty amazing for a vegan, even in a big city like Toronto. So that alone deserves a couple of stars. But then their food is actually also delicious and you get a lot for the price, so of course I absolutely love this place. And the food is made fresh, so I don't understand why people would complain about waiting times.."}
{"text":"Worst vegetarian food for the price in TO.

Cute place, and a great concept, but the food itself is a caricature of good vegetarian food -- the bowls are more or less what vegetarians eat at home when they have leftovers or don't want to cook.

A stupid simple meal -- a bowl of brown rice with some veggies and/or curry on top --  costs as gob-stopping $16. IF the few bits of veggies, worth maybe a couple of dollars at most, and less than $1 worth of brown rice (which retails at At $4-5 for a 5 lb. bag uncooked, requiring no effort to make in a rice cooker) actually tasted interesting, this might be OK. But this is some of the laziest vegetarian cooking ever. No interesting veggies, no interesting spices -- just meh.

In seeking out better value for the price, I have tended to gravitate towards the veggie burgers, which are OK. But what leads to the downfall of the burgers is the quality of the fries, which should be a logical side: the fries at \"Fresh\" are cooked in the dirtiest rancid cooking oil imaginable --I've gotten sick literally every time I've eaten them, and have finally given up on them.

On a recent trip my partner had the corn bread, and it was 100% stale -- he described it as tasting like it had been sitting on someone's dashboard for weeks -- which is ridiculous, since corn bread is simple to make and easy to keep moist. 

For $16+ per person, we'll be trundling further down Bloor West to any number of places where the vegetarian food is tastier and cheaper -- Ghazale has great veggie options, as do Mariko, Thai Basil, and many others. 

While the concept may be Fresh, the food isn't. And the servers are snarly, too."}
{"text":"The powerhouse bowl on soba is amazing. Just the combination of perfectly cooked tofu, chickpeas, avocado, tomato and tahini sauce works so well together. The mushroom onion burger, squash tacos and the poutine are also great! Enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Fresh on Bloor was the first one in the Fresh chain of three.
The current location is actually new, but back in the day the Bloor location was called \"Juice For Life\" and it was the only one.

The new interior is tight, too many seats for the space, you are literally elbow to elbow with the person sitting next to you.

But, it's the best vegetarian takeout in the city and the juices are dreamy!
It's the last fun to eat at out of the three locations, but if you're up on Bloor, you ain't got no choice now do ya?"}
{"text":"FRESH IS FANTASTIC! I go here almost weekly because it's one of the few places that can accommodate a very constricted diet. It's great as a vegetarian, or someone with gluten, milk or other food sensitivities, to be able to eat practically EVERYTHING on the menu!

The atmosphere is bustling but maybe too busy for some. I enjoy the bustle and my lemon water carafe is never left empty. I don't typically have to wait for a table but we usually go mid-day, early dinner or late. Avoid the 6pm rush!

Service is mostly good and I've enjoyed everything from the baby bowls like Buddha, Energy and Beach, to the dosas, burritos on a salad and sweet potato fries. 

The price is very reasonable for the food (smoothies are kind of expensive), and cheaper than other vegan/vegetarian places in the area.

I love Fresh! I go to all three locations equally and have an enjoyable meal everytime."}
{"text":"It was my first time here last weekend.  Saturday morning just as they open was best since this spot gets busy quick.  I had the squash tacos(as recommended by my friend) and gojiccino(with hemp milk). The tacos were good but could have been better with out the batter surrounding the squash and the gojiccino wasn't the best choice for me. My sever was very pleasant and I would come back again because I am a vegan and am always looking for good restaurants creating healthy choices plant based or not."}
{"text":"I had avoided Fresh for a long time. It's initial appearance as \"Juice for Life\" had little appeal to me as a place to eat - possibly an example of poor advertising. Since being introduced to Fresh in it's current incarnation, it has become possibly my favourite casual dining restaurant in the City. It's hard to compare.

Menu: As a near vegetarian and a very picky eater, I'm usually hard pressed to find an item or two on any menu that I actually want to eat. At Fresh, I'm picking through the menu trying to figure out what I'm going to try each time out. There are plenty of vegan options and plenty of ways to customize my order, an order that is well presented, using fantastic fresh ingredients, and thoroughly enjoyed.

Service: Depending on the time of day, you may have to wait to be seated (make sure they know you're there). Wait staff are kind, courteous, and generally attentive. Again, depending on time of day, the kitchen can move a little slow, possibly taking 20-30 minutes to bring your order.

Atmosphere: Noisy. A little cramped if you're not in a booth. But clean and well decorated. Definitely casual."}
{"text":"I've always been so curious about Fresh since these restaurants are always packed whenever I walk by them. Now that the curiosity has been curbed, I won't be back.

I didn't want to be too adventurous so I decided to go with the Grilled Vegetable and Pesto Burrito - with grilled red pepper, zucchini & sweet potato with pesto, house mayo, tomato, lettuce, cucumber, red onion & alfalfa sprouts ($10). I thought this was a pretty safe choice... but it was incredibly bland. It was as if they grilled the vegetables without any seasoning and placed it in the wrap. I couldn't taste the pesto at all.

I added a side of Sweet Potato Fries - with dip ($4.25) to my burrito. I complimented them with the garlic mayo. Fries were just okay, not very crispy. I still ate most of them because the garlic mayo was really good (and it helped save the burrito...).

My boyfriend went with the vegan, gluten-free Banana Nut Pancakes ($10 for triple/$8 for double). Not at all satisfying. They were incredibly dense and didn't have a great flavour to them. My boyfrend always eats everything on his plate (and mine) but this time there was quite a bit left on his plate. 

Maybe this place is really great by vegan standards...but this just didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"For vegetarian fare, fresh is top notch. Healthful food items that satisfy.
The black bean burrito with chipotle avocado sauce is one of my favourites, as is the \"Warrier\", a bowl of brown basmati rice, chickpeas and curry sauce (sans dairy). This stuff is actually really good for you! Their menu is divided into salads, wraps, burgers and bowls (noodle/rice combos). It's all delicious.

Fresh is also known for their fruit smoothies and shakes. Today's decision was tough. Did I want the Urgen-C, an elixir of grapefruit, orange, lemon, pineapple, ginger and Vitamin C, or the Detoxifier, a blend of apple, spinach, celery, parsley and kale? Settled on the former.  Tart, tangy, perfect. 

Hipster-ish staff are friendly and smile at you when you accidentally drop your chopsticks on the floor. 

Fresh is, well.... super fresh."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times and food is ok. I find most of their foods have a ton of ingredients, which is good, but it's a taste sensation that comes from mixing the same 5-8 ingredients in most dishes rather than any great culinary skill. In any event, decent experience so far. Until tonight.

Food was ok, but the service was terrible. My date ordered a soup and salad, and I ordered one of their elixir drinks. The waitress had a can't be bothered attitude from the start, but I figured our orders were simple enough that we didn't really need qualities like attentiveness in order for things to work out. Not quite. My date's food arrived in good time, and while the restaurant was not busy, our waitress did not notice that I sat there the entire time waiting for my drink to arrive. At the table next to ours - and their tables are so tightly packed that you will inevitably eavesdrop and/or get involved in your neighbour's discussion - the couple waited about 45 minutes for this same waitress to remember to bring the debit machine. When she finally cleared my date's empty dishes, I asked about my order. Barely even batting an eyelash she dropped a quick \"sorry, you don't really want it anymore, do you?\". We were also looking to order some drinks to take home but she had decided that we'd be getting our bill at that point. At least we didn't have to wait for the debit machine....

I get that this is not some high end restaurant and that things kinda slip through the cracks. And no, we didn't drop hundreds of dollars on the meal either. But it's at times like this that I wish places in this city didn't always only have teenagers working without adult supervision, teenagers that care more about having the right look and chatting with friends rather than their actual work. Again, the food is not spectacular by any standard and I'm happy to spend my $ in the other 10000 vegan/vegetarian places around the area. Just saying."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian food and very friendly service. We got green poutine, tofu tacos, a clubhouse wrap, and a powerhouse rice bowl with a substitution. The takeout cashier patiently answered my questions about food allergens, and the person who brought my food out was just as friendly. This place was too busy for us to eat there (around lunchtime), but we'd come back during a quieter time and recommend others do too!"}
{"text":"Love this place - the Energy bowl on rice with extra tehini sauce is my personal favorite. Have been coming here for a while now and this review is just to thank you guys at Fresh for the awesome food and service."}
{"text":"This place has great food and most items are vegan, with the option to add rennet-free cheese. I love the dragon bowl in particular, but everything I've had has been delicious!

It can get quite busy which sometimes means waiting for a table or having slow service, but the service has always been friendly when I've gone. I would definitely recommend it to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores!"}
{"text":"I dont know whaaaat you guys are talking about that it's not flavorful! This is the place (i agree with others who have said this) that i bring non-vegetarian/vegan people to in order to PROVE THEM WRONG

The BBQ burger is delicious! It's a treat to get, as yes, the prices are a little steep.

The tables are close together, but i never really found it a big problem. You only have to listen to the convos next door if you feel like it! and it's better quishing in a bunch of tables than having horrendous wait times for a restaurant as busy and that doesn't take resos!

I've only known about Fresh for about 2 years and I think they've changed the menu on me (if not more) 2 times. I miss the Coconut Tempeh... I miss the Katmandu Wrap... so that sucks! But still, their stuff still makes the cut.

I'd certainly recommend this place. But definitely with a pre-warning that it's not a quiet, slow-paced, romantic dinner venue. It does lunch and dinner, and around those times, yes, it gets pretty loud and packed. But it certainly is delicious!"}
{"text":"Its fairly evident by the scenery and the Beautiful staff that a good diet does a body good. I used to go here with a buddy to try and meet girls after their yoga classes, but it never really worked, as I think that sort of behavior is fairly transparent. 

I eat here to balance the Yin and yang of my life, with the YIn being a constant diet of bacon and cookies, I tend to find this as a way to make myself FEEL like i am a responsible eater.  the food generally tastes pretty good, and I tend to find it useful as a place to go when i have a guest in town who is of the V-word ilk. 

The onion rings are to die for, and i wish i would have never discovered them, as it kind of goes against my whole yang theory.  the bowls are typical: rice, beans, some sort of asian sauce, and go. I never really understand why vegiie food always has to be this Indian-Mediterranean jumble, but whatever.  

the big downside is the desserts, as, lets face it, carot cake with whipped tofu is NOT the same. 

now, only if they served a little meat....."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian for the past 14 years, I can honestly say that Fresh is one of the best veggie restaurants I've found (and I've tried MANY). This trendy restaurant lives up to its name - the food is fresh, organic and delicious. Although the service can be a little slow and wait times for a table can be lengthy, it's worth it once you try their vegan carrot cake. A must have!"}
{"text":"There are so many options here and surprisingly I don't miss meat when I'm here. I've tried a couple of things from here:
- salads are yummy
- soup was not bad (sorry can't remember what it was.. I think it has somethign to do with squash)
- black bean wrap and the veggie wraps were good and filling
- baby budda with soba noodles was small and filling but the sauce was really thick and the marinated tofu was kind of funky tasting
- corn bread was super crumbly and dry... so I'd never order that again

Overall, since I'm a poor student,I wish this place was cheaper because for what you get it's a little expensive."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE FOR A HEALTHY YUMMY LUNCH/DINNER. Went with my family and we all enjoyed the food! The Buddha Bowl  was supper yummy with added noodles. Place had a great feel inside being in the middle of the UFT campus and all. The smoothies were great along with the ginger latte. Would recommend and I definitely felt much healthier leaving! The only thing I would say is that the food took a little while to come out but it was a very busy Monday work night. :)"}
{"text":"I was taken to Fresh by a colleague before going off to a work event to meet a filmmaker (as I live the glamourous life of a career woman!). 

I'm a meat-eater, but won't say no to trying healthy new options, so off to Fresh I went. 

My initial impression upon walking in...crowded, narrow seating area (where have I heard this before?) but I loved the decor! Right up my alley!

I eagerly picked up the menu and was surprised by the amount of options. The drink menu was HUGE! I do have one complaint with the drink menu, more of a personal vendetta against the smoothie...I'm allergic to bananas, and being the base of the smoothness in the smoothie, you can't substitute something like that. So I was disappointed that I couldn't try the apple pie smoothie and other delicious-sounding varieties. 

I ordered the sweet potato fries with the garlic mayo, the Caesar salad and a hot peppermint hot chocolate. Overall, my personal bill came to about $20, so I wasn't too pleased with the prices. 

The sweet potato fries were delicious! The garlic mayo I could have done without. The fries were crispy and had a delicious seasoning. 

Unfortunately things are about to get ugly...

I ordered the Caesar salad as that's my staple food item, my go-to meal. I haven't had a caesar salad I didn't enjoy, until Fresh. I understand that things can't be the same in a vegan/veggie version of a caesar salad...but if it doesn't taste like caesar salad then it should not be called such. The salad tasted bland with a horrible aftertaste that was very difficult to get rid of. 

The peppermint hot chocolate was served in a glass as opposed to mug, which I thought was interesting. It also had an interesting back taste, but was overall fairly tasty, except for the gunk that took up about 1/5 of the glass. 

The place was busy...it was a weeknight...but service was kind of lacking. We had to pointedly stare at our waitress to get the bill. She was very worried that I didn't like my salad (I lied and said I was full from the fries, which was kinda true...) but other than that, service took a while. 

Nice decor, variety on the menu, good idea but Fresh gets an awkwardness rating of 3/5. Between the narrow seating and that we were practically sharing a booth with the people beside us and the service...not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Oookay now. I have been eating at Fresh for a while now and must say, the quality of the food is slowly tanking.  One of my favorite options is the bbq burger in a wrap with cheddar cheese. I'm disappointed  to say that it has gotten worse over the past few months and I feel there are often ingredients that are missing..(or at least that's what it tastes like). 

My sister and I just recently had lunch there and her opinions were similar. For the money that was spent, the quality was defiantly lacking.  She had the Buddha bowl and mentioned that there were ingredients that weren't in the dish that were listed on the menu. 

I do however enjoy the ambiance and the service is always quite good. Calling ahead is recommended if you don't feel like waiting at least 20 minutes for take-out or a table. 

Meh."}
{"text":"One of my best reasons to get to Toronto!  Such amazingly fresh (no pun intended, ha) juices and some of the best vegan cheesecake I have ever had.  The wait was a bit long but it's such a small fit and I find a bit of a wait speaks mostly well of an eatery.   Get here and you're going to crave this spot for years to come!"}
{"text":"The biggest crime that Fresh commits in my mind is that it is so completely overrated.  I have had delicious meals from them, yes, but the only truly satisfying ones have been take out rather than eat in, as I feel the dining room experience here leaves something to be desired.

For one thing the dining room is far too cramped, and during peak times it is not only frustrating to bump elbows on your way in/out, but also noisy.  The food is good but I think the slick lifestyle-based dining is more the appeal here, unfortunately.  It's the conspicuous consumption of eating - why be a vegetarian if you can't sit in a glorified fishbowl and prove just how vegan you are.

That said, I am a fan of the so-called power bowls with come with rice or noodles and an assortment of veggie type items including usually tofu or other bean-based proteins.  They are pretty tasty and if you can order in advance for pickup you're aces.  Just don't try to get anything to go from the restaurant without calling ahead, unless it's one of the previously made sandwiches ready wrapped at the front, which can be popular and go fast.  My one friend put it best by saying that eating at Fresh made her feel as though she was doing something good for her body, but that after enough meals from there you realize you're basically just filling up on leaves and simple carbs."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm a big meat eater but had brunch here last week.  Soooo good! Black beans...wow"}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple times because it is really the only healthy option in the neighbourhood, but have never really been happy with a meal I have had.  I have a few big complaints that are the reasons why i am giving fresh a poor rating. 

1. Bland food: no matter how natural, organic or vegan you claim your food is, that should never be an excuse for making tasteless food. 

2. Poor execution: everything just looks like it is thrown on a plate, no presentation or care given to the quality of the product. 

3. Massive menu: there is no reason for there to be 15 variations of every option, most are basically the same. 

As you can see these are all complaints with the food. The atmosphere is nice and the staff generally nice and helpful. 

If you need something healthy in the annex, it's a decent option, but if your looking for flavourful, delicious vegan food, there are better options."}
{"text":"I'm so over Fresh.  You're stale.  I don't know what keeps people coming back.  Is it the atmosphere?  Because it's always packed, noisy, and overbearing.  The food?  It's  bland!  Their bowls are pretty big, but who wants to shovel down that much boring, sodium-rich sauce-laden noodle?  

P.S. \"Buddha Bowl\" makes me chuckle.  what about a \"Mohammed Melange\" or \"Jesus Jambalaya\"?   Would it be okay to employ other such deities on Fresh's meticulously branded menu?

P.P.S. I had a corn muffin once.  It was like.... hydrated sand."}
{"text":"this place is the shiznit. I got there just in the nick of time before there was a huge wait. The service was slow... like really slow. but the food made up for it. They have an amazing menu, all vegan and uber healthy. 

urgen-c juice- 5/5 amazing....works... dont ask
italian raw bowl- 4.5/5
mega life salad-  4/5 huge

repeat: yes! but at a location closer to me"}
{"text":"I was a vegetarian for 5 years... I'm not now, but I certainly have a spot in my heart for good vegetarian food.  That said, apart from the convenience factor of knowing that everything on the menu is at least vegetarian, I can't, for the life of me, understand why Fresh is so popular.  I mean, I get it: it's really nice to know that there's no hidden anchovy paste, or chicken stock, or some other such non-vegetarian additions to your meal, but those bowls they make are ghastly!  Not only that, but you could make virtually every one of them with Organic ingredients at home for half the price and twice the flavour.  I tried the veggie burger on a good friend's recommendation and I have to say that I've had better at crappy pubs in T.O.  Bottom line, there are much. much better and tastier vegetarian options in Toronto: I'd give it 1 star if not for the convenience factor I mentioned above.  Blah"}
{"text":"Having been coming here time to time since I started going to uni, I am satisfied with the foods. My favourite has to be mega salad which comes with nuts, parsley, carrots and tofu and such. It is always fresh and delicious. Spring rolls are solid and BBQ burger pulls the greatest trick in the world of cooking: It tastes like a burger without meat! 

I would give 5 stars as menu prices fit my student budget perfectly. But Service is sometimes annoying. Foods come out so slowly when I have to get back to class. And some servers are rude. 

This restaurant offers takeout options, which eliminates the need to deal with servers."}
{"text":"On the end of my street, I eat here at least once a week. Always great service. The food is UNREAL. Like, all of it. I usually go for the Holiday Wrap. Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I just got takeout, so I don't know about the service, but Omg I cannot recommend enough the sweet potato fries with the miso gravy sauce. My mouth was so completely satisfied. All of our sandwiches and bowls were good, too, but nothing can compare to the aformentioned potato-sauce combination!"}
{"text":"great place if a little pricey, packed for lunch but we were still seated quickly, sparce but efficient and friendly service, we had a burger, salads and juices and they were all excellent, would definitely go back..."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite restaurant. 

I came here with a friend to celebrate my belated birthday. I've been dying to try this place after reading the rave reviews, but never got around to it...until today! My friend is a vegan, so it was a perfect plan. 

We arrive around 1:30pm and it was still the lunch rush, yet we only waited 10 minutes to be seated. The atmosphere is so welcoming and you'll be seated very closely with two other tables (except if you get a booth), but we had no problem being so close to strangers. I ordered the tropical transfusion smoothie and it was one of the most \"natural\" tasting smoothies ever - it's not over sugared. We shared our starters, which I would recommend the quino onion rings. Something I never tried before and something you don't see everyday! The dips are worth trying, even if it's an additional cost. I ordered a BBQ burger and it was the best veggie burger I ever tried. My friend seems extremely happy with her Mushroom Onion Burger and is so excited to come back to try all the other dishes they offer here!

Even if it's pricey, I think this is my main restaurant for now on. The food does take a while to be made, but I guess that explain the amazing taste. It's extremely healthy and I didn't feel disgustedly bloated from it - which I usually feel like after eating a big meal at a restaurant.  And and, the service is one of the friendly service I ever experienced! Which makes it a double thumbs up. 

Yay to FRESH!"}
{"text":"I took three things to go on my way back to New York (I was in Toronto on vacation and in search of awesome vegan). The magic tofu sandwich was pretty good. The tofu itself truly was magical. It was the best tofu I've ever had outside of within Asian food. It really tasted like chicken--must have been the seasoning. However, the rest of the sandwich was not done properly. There was more bread than anything else, and that was disappointing (though it was good). Also the mustard sauce was a bit overpowering, as were the onions.

My impression of the baked goods was very good. I got carrot cake and a banana chocolate chip muffin. Both were delicious. This is the best carrot cake I've ever had, actually, except for one place in Manhattan that is awesome, though not vegan. I would definitely get more baked goods here, at the least."}
{"text":"Service was great, they're really helpful and try to be as accomodating as possible. It's a good idea to call in before dropping by - they're really busy. Food that I've tried was very nice and it's one place on my frequented list."}
{"text":"I have been going to Fresh for ages since it was down on Bloor closer to Bathurst. (now its at (Spadina and Bloor).  Since they opened a new location close to my place at Yonge and Eglinton we have been going there. A few months ago they changed their menu and increased their prices dramatically.  I mean even before the increase it was pretty steep to pay over $13 for a bowl of rice with some veggies on top.  The food here is not even organic so I don't see how they could justify their prices let alone raise them?  After going to Fresh for at least 10 years I will not be going back.  Way overpriced now and overhyped I am sad to say."}
{"text":"I think it was 4 years ago I had my first Fresh experience. I had the Energy bowl, and it fell completely flat for me. Total lack of seasoning, and just too mushy.

Fast forward to 2013, and I think to myself, hey let's give this joint another go, this time arming myself with recommendations from fellow Yelpers.

We started with the Quinoa Onion Rings, which of course, were a revelation! Super duper crispy, and complemented well by the Garlic Mayo. I would order this again.

For my main, I chose the Beach Bowl with Goat Cheese (Instead of Tofu). As per other Yelpers' advice, I asked for more veggies and less rice. So glad that I did, because the bowl was mammoth.

While I enjoyed the flavours of the dish, it wasn't revolutionary by any means. Definitely something that can be easily recreated at home. Also, it was a tad cumbersome to eat, as all the veggies were cut large.

I would return again to explore the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I am posting this review after visiting Fresh (Bloor & Spadina) 4 times.

PROS:

- Delicious food that mega satisfied this non vegan and her meat-loving hubby!
- I am plant-based and love my veggies, but hubs is a \"meat-avore\" - I had to drag him here! He did not regret it.
- Banana pancakes, bbq burger, quinoa onion rings, poutine, split pea & sweet potato soup-- delicious!
- Large portions (yes, prices are on the higher side, but it's generous portions of quality food).
- Ginger Fireball hot drink (my favourite!) opened my stuffed nose and soothed my sore throat.
- Weekend brunch.
- Very welcoming & friendly staff.
- Excellent customer service-- I ordered 2 quarts of green smoothie to take home. After I arrived home, I noticed the foam had settled and the bottles were less than 3/4 full. I showed Fresh a picture on social media, and they immediately apologized and offered me 2 free quarts! I told them it wasn't necessary (since I drank them already), but they insisted. So nice!
- Toronto Veg Association discount (15% off take out).
- Close to Spadina subway.
- They just updated their menus this week.

CONS:

- It's busy. Really busy. It's that good!
- I do wish this place was a little bigger... and open 24 hrs (but that's a selfish request) lol

Overall.... I'm rarely impressed and super critical of how I spend my money. I'll be back here, over and over again."}
{"text":"Fresh is not fresh food. It tastes like it's only one day away from the compost heap. You know this if you ever have it the next day. And there WILL be leftovers, as it's so tasteless you won't want much the first go around.

There are great vegan places out there. There's no reason for it to be tasteless. 

Whatever you do, avoid the poutine. From-frozen fries, messy fake cheese that's like Cheez Whiz without any flavour, and they don't even fry the fries enough to avoid them getting soggy immediately. 

One of the most overrated restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"I went in with a friend because there are always people consuming yummy-healthy looking food in the front window. My admiration from afar was not wasted! I am also not a vegetarian - but this is now my favourite place to eat near the downtown UofT campus.

I had one of the vegetarian burgers - so yummy! I also appreciated that it was reasonably priced for a sit-down meal. Perhaps this is because the sandwiches come without sides (not a problem, it was so filling there was no need) - but for those wanting something more, the sides look yummy and are definitely reasonably priced as well.

Also - there were lots of daily specials offered on juices, soups, and meals, so I am sure I will never get bored!

one last bonus - the place is nicely decorated and the staff was totally friendly and helped us out when we realized we were in a bit of a rush."}
{"text":"Had brunch there today, food was great, service was great, staff was cheerful. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you first: I love fresh. I'm not vegan/vegetarian but i love fresh. (keep that in mind as you read this review).

Usually I eat in (there is usually a 15-20 minute wait when my friends and I go on Saturdays for lunch - head to the hostess to get your name on the list). Fresh is busy! Keep that in mind - you'll probably have to wait a bit.

I love the wraps, deep immune drink, spring rolls, their pumpkin squash soup, and onion rings (!!!!) highly recommend trying the spring rolls and onion rings when you visit. If you liked the drinks, you can order them in 1 L glass bottles. bring the bottle back and you get 15% off the next drink order.  Bowls are good to share or if you're absolutely starving. I suggest staying away from the breakfast stuff though (i heard the eggs and pancakes taste funny)

Today was a bit different - i ordered takeout: It was a bit of a wait, since the restaurant was really busy, but it was worth it (if you're ordering take out, i suggest you call in and order, and just mosy over to the restaurant after a bit, so you won't be waiting in the narrow hallway). 

I ordered: 
Holiday wrap with goat cheese and nuts, (goat cheese and nuts are extra, so just keep that in mind if you're on a budget.) and spring rolls

the ingredients used in the wrap is really fresh - when you bite in and chew, you hear crisp crunches. It's a decent sized portion (I usually take the other 1/2 to go, when I eat in). 

By the time I got to the spring rolls, they weren't warm, but they were still good (the sauce that comes with it is amazing). 

oh and their takeout boxes (including the round containers for sauces) are compostable."}
{"text":"From a meat eater:
Poor service (30 min wait) and noisy with small tables
Expensive. 40 plus tax for two people
Tasteless. Noodles had no taste.sauce was only good thing about it.when eating greens the wooden chop sticks were stronger tasting than the foods
Chefs were a bunch of hipsters wearing wool hats and baseball caps. I thought hair nets were mandatory. Either way Im almost postivie theyre not real cooks as it takes near no effort to open a bag of greens and fry some tofu

The greens were NOT fresh nor were they washed. Some of the greens were wilted and from what I remember youre supposed to wash the greens even if they come pre-washed in the plastic bag they use. This means that theyre not farm fresh or anything like that. Its the same pre-packaged greens you find at any grocery mart.

The burgers are huge which means I can soak them in sauces. Otherwise it would be near tasteless again.

I understand vegetarians tend to lose out on good taste since their selection is limited but this made me crave a streak after eating .

not sure how vegans can put up with this daily"}
{"text":"Fresh has great food. Even meat eaters like myself enjoy it! Their homemade hot sauce should not be missed. 
It is, however, very loud, crowded, busy, and the wait for your food is very long. The portion sizes are ginormous, but their prices aren't so cheap either. I wanted to save money by getting a side dish and smoothie, but their cheapest, smallest smoothie is over $6! 
That said, for the occasional outing it's great. Their burgers, especially the BBQ Burger, are amazing and their brunch pancakes are great too. If you have money to splurge, go for the delicious smoothies, but they can easily cost more than your food. 

CONS: The atmosphere is lacking and the loooonngg wait for your order is pretty crazy (generally 20-25 min AFTER you order) and the prices are a bit high. 

PROS: the food is great for anyone, meat-eater or otherwise. The hot sauce is SO worth the trip, and the weekend brunches are great. Smoothies are the best in the city but also the most costly."}
{"text":"Fresh is ALRIGHT.

I would agree with most reviews here. It's for sure overrated. 

Atmosphere: Nice and clean contemporary interior design. However, the dining area was small. It could get loud fast considering there are other diners in arms reach all around you. 

Service: Average.

Food: I enjoyed how the menu was different. The food was delicious. The smoothies....meh."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Fresh for lunch or dinner. Never been there for their brunch. I'm not a vegetarian but I like the fact that you have the choice of eating light or indulging at Fresh. At first I used to go there once a week, but now I'm at Fresh two to three times a week either for take-out or dine-in. and I don't even live in the Annex. 

Here are the top items on their menu, in my opinion:

Food:

- Quinoa Onion Rings
- Sweet Potato Fries with the Thai Peanut Sauce dip
- Big Salad (get it with goat cheese and house dressing)
- BBQ Burger
- Beach Bowl (I usually add the grilled tempeh to this)
- Powerhouse Bowl
- Black Bean Burrito 

Try their hot sauce, they make it in house and it's very good if you like spicy food. It's unlike any other hot sauce I've tried before. 

Drinks:

- Date Almond Smoothie 

There is a huge menu of drinks that you can choose from, the Date Almond Smoothie is my favourite if you're craving something sweet. 

The service here is great, although at times they seem to be overwhelmed with the high volume and high turnover. The staff is friendly and willing to give recommendations."}
{"text":"Came here with my dad the other day and I had the Buddha bowl and him, The Works burger. 
For my bowl, the rice was nice and crunchy (brown rice) just the way I like it, so that was a plus. They OD'd on the sauce though, because after a couple bites, it starting to become really nauseating. I took some of the sauce out and dug for some of the rice at the bottom of the bowl that was not stained with sauce and it was goooood.
On the other hand, my dad's burger was not as great as it looked; the burger itself tasted funky (although it did look very appetising).
We also ordered springrolls (which has the SAME sauce as the Buddha bowl) and the springrolls itself is just a rice paper roll filled with vermecelli and deep fried. Not the authentic springrolls that we had thought, but still very yummy!
The drinks are also TO DIE FOR! I had the deep cleanse (I think that's what it's called) and although it was really sour, it was also really refreshing. Recommend for those who can \"handle\" the sour. 
I will definitely be coming back to try their Zen drink (the one with the matcha green tea and almond milk...mmmm)."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars, except it's a bit over-priced and noisy.  I really like all of their food and have found the juices, smoothies, and other take-out items to be a nice touch.  The staff are mostly young, quasi-hipster types, and they have a nice and small selection of beers and wines available to drink.

They have some killer bowls which are great with Soba noodles and some really hearty veggie burgers; I don't remember the name of it, but I would highly recommend one that comes with battered onion rings on it!  It's huge and has a really fresh taste!

Again, the only real knock on this place is that it's pretty expensive..."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan or vegetarian so I don't eat in a lot of vegetarian restaurants. My friends had tried this place and said good things about it and one of them has been counting calories so we decided to eat here. The place was small and packed at this location. We started off with the spring rolls - stuffed with brown rice vermicelli, mushrooms, carrot & cilantro served with thai peanut dipping sauce. The peanut sauce was yummy, the spring roll was pretty good. We also had the quinoa onion ring - coated with breadcrumbs & puffed quinoa and chipotle mayo. It was pretty blend with the breadcrumb coating, the mayo added a little taste but there was not much chipotle kick to it. Overall, not that impress, tasted like paper.

For the main course, I got the thai burger - thai peanut sauce, tomato, lettuce, green onions, bean sprouts & cilantro. Even though the patty was not meat and made from almond & grain, it was still pretty filling, I had to sacrifice part of the bun in order to finish it. Though it may be that I had appetizers that filled me up already. The peanut sauce was good with the veggie patty. The patty was big, it was hard to bite the burger in one bite. Not a big fan of the raw bean spout on the bottom. Overall, it was worth the try of my first veggie burger. I don't love it and definitely miss a real meat burger. It was not a cheap burger as it adds up if you want sides, dipping sauce."}
{"text":"When I visited the Bloor location it was really busy, but our food (which was delicious!) still came out in a good amount of time, and our server was friendly and helpful. I visited the location on Eglinton as well (just stopped in for a couple of their Sweets from the Earth vanilla cupcakes--which are so, so, so good) and the girl at the front was super nice and helpful.

They do have a great selection and even my non vegetarian friends love this place!"}
{"text":"Fresh has become one of my favourite restaurants recently. I love the anti-viral/ cold buster elixirs for when I feel like I'm coming down with something, and I always get a fresh-made juice (either a green juice, or carrot/apple juice). The only thing that would make this place way better is if it had all organic or some organic options. Especially if the juice could at least be organic, that would be wonderful, as juice gets immediately absorbed into the bloodstream and organic would be way healthier.

I've had their bowls with soba noodles which are very delicious and filling, and I feel good and energized after eating them. The baby (small) bowl is more than enough for me. Also the squash tacos are delicious. I have yet to try the other things on the menu and would like to try their brunch items. So far I'll definitely be coming back here regularly. The atmosphere is really nice the music playlist has great indie songs. The waiters have a hip, indie, urban style, but are still all very approachable and friendly. Don't worry about any intimidating hipster pretence or BS here. :) 

I've also been to the Eglington, and Queen locations and been happy with them, but they were too loud and packed. I find the Annex location to be the most zen/ least crazy of them all, which I like."}
{"text":"To start off, I would like to state that I used to be a huge fan of this restaurant. However, this past experience has left me extremely disappointed. We went on a Sunday around 5:00 PM and it was not packed which I was happy about as the service can be pretty slow when that occurs. I suggested this restaurant specifically because I was with an individual who had some pretty strict dietary restrictions and I thought that Fresh would be the best option considering the veggies are always fresh and you can order a pretty healthy and tasty meal. Unfortunately, this was not the case for us. Two of the four meals ordered were pretty dull but edible and the other two... well they were horrendous. The bean sprouts were brown and borderline bad, the kale was yellow, hard and so bitter you couldn't eat it. I know kale is bitter, I cook and eat kale all the time. This was something else. This was disgusting! The individual who had dietary restrictions walked out of the restaurant starving. To top it off, there were so many flies in the place. That really should have been a sign for us not to go but we were all so hungry and just wanted something healthy and tasty to eat. When the server came around and asked us how everything was, I informed her of the food and thank goodness she was a reasonable person and took the two items (that were not eaten) off of our bill. 

Honestly, I am sad to say that I will not be going back to Fresh and if anyone suggests it as a spot to eat, I will tell them of the experience that I had there."}
{"text":"I have been to each Fresh location more times than I can count, though I seem to prefer the one at Queen W & Crawford.

In my opinion, the only reason to go to Fresh is to order a bowl. They're hearty, heathy and very delicious. You get loads of veggies and can customize with either brown rice, soba noodles or greens. I love the macro greens, the green goddess, the buddah, and the powerhouse. 

I should also mention that their burgers are great - not soy based as far as I know. Excellent option for people that limit their intake of soy or any kind of 'fake' meat. (Like me!) 

It can get a little pricy but with a place that offers a quality, guilt-free meal complete with juices, smoothies and dessert if you dare - its a fast favourite."}
{"text":"BUDDHA BOWL!!! How I miss thee :(

I'm 50% Torontonian and I know that if there's one vegetarian restaurant you should eat at, its Fresh.

Conveniently located on the Bloor subway line, the Annex and UofC, there's no excuse for you not to dine here and try out their amazing bowls. The last time I was here was for lunch and I did have a baby sized one; I was on much stricter diet then, but it was still filling.

BTW, I'm 50% Calgarian and I love my medium rare steaks just like the next cow town person, but in Toronto, Fresh has my number as one of the restaurants I must eat at while I'm here.

And sadly, just as Sapna mentioned, Calgary doesn't have a Fresh here *sigh*

I promise you, you will not be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"So I ordered the Dragon Bowl. Tofu slices were not evenly seasoned. Very simple bowl with jasmine rice, a sesame sauce, and grilled zucchinis. The rice was sticky and did not seem freshly cooked. Overall the 16 price tag for the bowl was not the best. However, their hot sauce is really interesting and has quite the kick to it."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off with the positives. The food here was amazing. I got the Beach bowl. It was fresh, yummy and the portion was HUGE! I packed half to go.

The service however, was one of the worst I've had in a long time. We went as a group of 9 people for lunch on a tuesday. The server came to our table and told us about their auto-grat for groups in a bitchy tone. Then she argued with us for 10mins about how they can't do separate bills for us. (With that time standing there arguing with us, she could've already done it.)

Her attitude was rude and condescending. It made our meal not the most enjoyable experience. 
I'll probably only be doing take out from this place now. I have too many other options around that area to be taking crap from bad quality servers."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Tuesday, lots of people here, I was so glad that I came early.
Ordered green poutine. Fries under lots of nuts and greens, it was tasty but a little bit salty for me( update: too salty, I kept drinking water in the whole afternoon). 
It is not a healthy or low calories choice, but who can say no to poutine :) Their menu is huge from wrap to taco and different kinds of bowl, which is really good."}
{"text":"Ate here after eating at the one on Spadina.  This one is open later, so we went here one night.

Food was exactly the same, and that is great.  bbq veggie burger for days."}
{"text":"Awesome veg food. BBQ burger, sweet potato fries are my favorites. For brunch the pancakes rock. Seating is limited and tight."}
{"text":"Love this place. Consistently good food. Healthy. Good prices. Great service. Can't go wrong. Good portions. I aways get the the clubhouse wrap. Delicious."}
{"text":"Very busy spot. Had a table right next to the long line of people early on a Saturday afternoon. Luckily, it was so loud that it wasn't bothersome. For the crowd, the service was attentive and efficient, which was a pleasant surprise. 
I can only give 4 stars because I was not thrilled with my Buddha Bowl main. I found myself scrounging from my friends' plates, which were excellent. Detox juice was perfect."}
{"text":"It's a great thing to walk into a restaurant, look at the menu and realize there is not one item on the menu that is \"bad\" for you. Ah, Fresh. Clean interior, punchy colours, oddly dark bathroom and all. I've come here for lunch a few times and always enjoy. 

On this occasion, the waitress was one of those lucky people. When  you meet this breed, you're automatically struck with a friend-crush. I like how she could list off the specials all casual, nbd in her sundress and cool owl shoulder tattoo. 

Service in general was just really good, someone was always coming around to replace our jug of water before we had even finished. 

I ordered the tangled garden salad. Don't get this is you're on a date. It is tangly. But I was with a few friends so I didn't mind making a mess of myself as I manoeuvred through the curly strings of carrot and yellow beet. 
-Zippy peanut lime dressing! 
-The salad topper of various nuts, seeds, etc. was great for extra crunchiness. 
-No need for the crispy tofu cubes because the salad is surprisingly filling! 

When I first looked at my salad I was a bit sad but woah, it delivered. Wait a minute, for any healthy meal that hits the spot, Fresh delivers."}
{"text":"The original creator of hipster aloof, Fresh continues to keep this outdated Toronto service style. The food is very great and fresh as their name states. No surprise  it's the type of establishment that fills quickly so get there early or late.  Soups are very filling, delicious, and good value here.  Unfortunately fresh custom juices have fallen by the wayside for prebottled cold pressed. Wasnt this business created on fresh juice??  I miss it. The chocolate cake is unbelievable. Share it, it's intense, and they give a good portion."}
{"text":"I'm always a little bit underwhelmed by Fresh. Though I am now an ex-vegetarian, I am in no way averse to such pleasures as fermented soy beans, blue-green algae, and steamed kale. However, there are many ways to make vegetarian/vegan food taste good, and Fresh seems to be very hit and miss as far as flavour goes. 

I've had some things that I really enjoyed: their daily soups are usually hearty and delicious, the mushroom onion burger never disappoints, all the appetizers I've tried are a safe choice (the corn bread is particularly good), and I've never had a smoothie or dessert that missed the mark. Unfortunately, I usually find that the \"fresh bowls\" (various combinations of vegetables and vegetarian proteins, served over brown basmati rice or soba noodles) are severely under-salted, boring, and bland. I feel the same way about the salads. 

As for service and environment, I've always had friendly and attentive servers- no complaints on that count. Be aware that if you walk in during busy hours, you will have a hard time hearing your dining companion(s). The tables are very close together, so when the restaurant is full, there is a very loud chorus of diners."}
{"text":"Have been coming to Fresh on Bloor for years and its easily my favourite of the four Fresh Restaurants in Toronto. Every time I visit I'm met with exceptional service, and great food. I've never had a disappointing visit to Fresh on Bloor and I visit whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"More like 1 1/2 stars. I was told the wait would be about 15 to 20 minutes. I got there just after 7pm and was expecting to be out of there before 8:20 pm as I had to be somewhere before 9pm. I got seated at 7:30 pm the waiter was very nice and got my order right away cause I usually get the All Star salad. He came back with water and utensils. If I had known my food would've taken 50 minutes to arrive I would've just left and got a salad else where. Why am I waiting for a salad for 50 minutes? And a women next to me got her quinoa ring before I got my food and she was seated at least 20 minutes after I was?? This location was too busy and had too many take out orders. If Fresh wanted to get into delivery and such they should have the man power to put out dine in orders as well. Waiting 50 minutes for a salad is unacceptable, I had a headache from waiting so long paired with the 2 loud girls sitting at the table next to mine. My food came to me at 8:20 and I quickly ate half of it and had to rush out with the rest of the food since I was running late.  I would not come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Great vegan options, but their menu hasn't changed in 6 years!  I love the green goddess and Buddha bowls, along with any of their juices.  Good for a casual healthy experience."}
{"text":"This location is by far the best of all the Fresh restaurants. It's roomier and service is better. Food is awesome, portions are adequate for the price but sometimes the food is slow to arrive. That's my only issue. My number one fave on the menu is the green poutine. So good."}
{"text":"I am not vegetarian and it was awful... the hamburger tasted like raw chickpea, ceasar salad was nothing like the ceasar salads i have seen and tasted..."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, however they got rid of my favourite dressing sriracha maple dressing , not sure why. The environment is super load and you feel rushed , they try to pack in as many people as possible . Looks like quantity of quality . Sad."}
{"text":"This place is super close to work and I love to drop by on days my body is yelling, \"Gimme healthy food!!\"  

It's great of take out and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"I love Fresh. So many healthy and tasty food options to choose from. Here are some dishes that I like:

1 Ironman salad
2 Falafel tacos 
3 Jerusalem rice bowl
4 Indian dosas
5 Onion rings 
6 Barbeque burger
7 Picnic burger 
8 Thai burger 
9 Buddha rice bowl 
10 Dragon rice bowl 
11 Tofu tacos 
12 Black bean burrito 
13 Soup of the day 

Fresh makes one of the best falafels. That is why I love the first 3 items. The Ironman salad is the best salad out of all their salads. I find the other salads taste kind of bland. I have had the fruit smoothies before. They are ok, but I find they taste a bit watered down. I do love the Moroccan mint tea though. In terms of food portions, I would say that it is very decent. I am pretty full when I leave there. The service is amazing and I speak for the this location and the one at Spadina and queen st. I never been to the one on Crawford or Eglinton. All in all I would say Fresh is one of the best choices for eating out. I enjoy coming here."}
{"text":"The food is a given (even for non-vegan food lovers) but the service was even better. When my super nice waitress messed something up they totally over-compensated and were so incredibly nice about the mess up (making me a whole other meal to take home and a coupon for a new smoothie)"}
{"text":"I will eat here if I have to because I'm starving with no other options, but if I had the time, I'd STILL travel to Kupfert and Kim and pick up a Oxaca salad (WHAT?! :) )

The food here looks and sounds delicious, and I tried the bean burrito wrap, which was tasty, but not as tasty as at K&K in a salad. It was missing a bit of seasoning for me, and the guacamole was not a guacamole, as it was a dripping avocado sauce.

Still, I inhaled it because I was starving.

I'd REALLY just come here for the smoothies and drinks.

As a side note, they offer 10% off on all takeout if you use your LiveGreen Toronto card (free!!)

Read:

So yeah I'd come here to eat with friends, and I'm willing to try their other menu items (a lot more extensive), but my heart is still with K&K."}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant! I've ordered take out a few times and was never disappointed. Their dine-in experience is just as good. 
I ordered the falafel tacos. Unfortunately a mistake was made, but the issue was resolved with such haste and efficiency that I feel guilty calling it a mistake. 
The service is very friendly, and the food is good."}
{"text":"Excellent vegetarian/vegan items on the menu with an interesting twist to add protein or energy mixes to them. We ordered the burger with fries which was excellent. Also tried the bowl and wrap. Both very good. The waiter was super polite and helpful to our dietary needs. Service is slow but I guess it because they are making everything fresh. Definitely tasted that way. The Smoothies are awesome. All in all would recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Just discovered a new vegetarian place near UofT campus!
Came on a Thursday night and it was packed, and we were seated after about 10 minutes. The waiter was nice and the service was great!
Food: I ordered the one of the salad bowls (the first one on the menu) and it came with romaine lettuce, a lot of quinoa, beans, and various veggies. It also came with their homemade tortilla, which tasted like it was made out of black beans! My friend ordered the Beach bowl over rice, and she also enjoyed it a lot! Ingredients are really fresh and they don't skimp out!
Price: The price is on the higher end, as each of the bowls and salads are between $12-18. So, you're looking for about a $20 meal. Because it is so pricey, I'm not sure if I will come again often, but the meal is big enough that you can to-go half of it home for lunch the following day!

-I will definitely come back though to try their wraps, tacos, smoothies, and other bowls! They also have various desserts! (Carrot cake, cupcakes, etc)."}
{"text":"My first time here and was impressed with the variety of items on the menu from juices to mains to dressing and desserts. Since I was so overwhelmed with the menu I wish the server helped me pick something or explain the menu a little to help me make a choice. Unfortunately the customer service really sucked, the servers weren't very friendly or quick to help although it wasn't that busy. 
I had a green smoothie and soup salad cornbread combo. Soup was potato leek and tasted okay, nothing special. Salad was also just okay but the ranch dressing was great. I added tofu steaks to it and it came with two little pieces of tofu . Could have bought a whole block of tofu for $2.50. Cornbread was horrible, didn't even eat it. Overall disappointed with this experience which happened to be my first meal in Toronto."}
{"text":"omg such delicious food! Grapefruit juice, onion rings, so amazing. Wish we'd found this place sooner, and that we had one closer to us!"}
{"text":"I love Fresh and am always so pleased with my meal there.  The service at this location is particularly great, and despite the fact that it is usually very busy with a line-up I never feel rushed or hurried.  As a vegetarian, it's great to have so many options and without sounding too cliche, the food really is fresh.  I particularly love the onion rings, they're so big! I also enjoy their burgers and steamed greens and tofu."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd be so into vegan food until I came here! The BBQ burger is to die for, with crunchy quinoa crusted onion rings.  The tofu I had on my salad was very well seasoned and I couldn't get enough of the peanut lime dressing. The meal was surprisingly filling but didn't leave me feeling bloated at all. All in all, amazing place if you want to try something different and healthy!"}
{"text":"My favourite vegan restaurant in Toronto. I understand that vegan food isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I promise that this is worth a try. The ingredients are amazingly fresh (which is so important), the food is never overcooked, and the tofu actually tastes like chicken. Two of my biggest pet peeves when it comes to food are 1. overcooked, 2. under-seasoned; none of which are found here. It's just wholesome ingredients and proper cooking technique, nothing more. I can't say it'll make someone want to be vegan, but it'll make any vegan / health-conscious eater very happy. I used to come here regularly after yoga, highly recommend.

P.S. The cornbread is the bomb, especially considering that it's vegan.

P.P.S. Took off one star for the price because I could easily eat $30 worth of food here if I get one of the smoothies."}
{"text":"I'm headed to T-Dot next week and in honour of my upcoming trip, I'd like to give a shout out to my all-time favourite restaurant in Toronto.

Fresh is *amazing*. Why doesn't Calgary have one??? That's all I ask - just ONE.

Toronto has a multitude of these gems, and all of them are equally amazing. I especially love this location. It's the perfect stop amidst a shopping spree and I plan to frequent it with my girl Julie H.

My favourite thing to order at Fresh is the Warrior bowl. Brown rice, chickpeas, steamed spinach, and coconut, all piled high in a bowl. You tackle the goodness with chopsticks and by the time you're done, not only are you COMPLETELY satisfied, but your taste buds have travelled to heaven and back.

Expect to find me here, with a massive Warrior bowl, a jug of lemon water, and some VERY fine company.

I can't wait!!!

I'm salivating just thinking about it.  Jeesh, don't mind the drool on the keyboard..."}
{"text":"Love this location! Every time we go I always get the server to recommend something new for me to try and I always love it. One of my favourite parts about Fresh is how customizable the menu is, It's really easy to take away or add something new to the dish you are getting. 

Hands down my favourite item to get is the squash tacos. If you haven't ever tried them stop what you are doing right now and get them. Honestly. There is real magic in those, people!!

This time when I went I also got a cold pressed juice to take away. They are 10-12$/11oz depending on the juice you get. They also come in a glass jar that you can reuse for other things too which is nice! I got  #4 which is  kale, parsley, lemon, beet, green apple. Super tasty and it left me feelin' freshhh!

( If you're still reading this you should go and grab some of those tacos now :) )"}
{"text":"Awesome veggie burgers. Brought the whole family. Beyond and Banquet burgers were great. Big salad was good too. I'll be back"}
{"text":"LOVEEEEEEEEEE THIS PLACE. I can always count on this place for something good.  The juices are great and their menu appeals to all lifestyles. I'm a fan"}
{"text":"Fresh is one of my most missed restaurants in Toronto, and I try to eat here whenever I'm in town. I always order a bowl, so when I was in a couple of weeks ago went with the Buddha. My boyfriend got the barbecue burger, and we shared a poutine. I actually regretted ordering the Buddha bowl, because it is a bit repetitive, and not the most exciting of the bowls. I usually prefer the beach with goat's cheese, as it has more components and is a bit fresher. Also the regular sized bowl is massive, and was way too much for me to finish (my eyes were bigger than my stomach I guess). My boyfriend liked his barbecue burger, and I got to eat one of the quinoa onion rings, which is something that Fresh makes really well. Lastly, the poutine was AMAZING. I don't know what I was expecting, but it blew all expectations and might have been the best poutine I've ever had. The mushroom gravy is very rich, heavy, and comforting, and the \"cheese\" was delicious and salty. The sauce to fry ratio was a bit heavy, and the fries could have been a bit crispier in order to stand up to the amount of sauce, but the overall taste was super good and I'd definitely order it again. 

The only thing that's sad to see is that prices keep going up here. I feel like Fresh is becoming increasingly more unaffordable, especially for students, which is sad because this used to be such a go-to place when I was a student in need of a healthy take-out. There are other great vegetarian places popping up around Toronto, so maybe Fresh will have to have a bit of an update in order to stay competitive. It wasn't as busy as I remember it being in the past, so maybe people are catching on to this."}
{"text":"But where's the meat?

Kidding. I came here with a friend after we were aimlessly walking on Bloor, looking for somewhere to eat. We passed by Fresh and it looked packed inside so naturally, we went inside to check out the hype.

They have an EXTENSIVE menu, no joke. It took us a while before we realized that there was no meat on the menu, but by the time we did, it didn't matter anyway because we already had several options in mind.

I ordered the Green Poutine, which was essentially a bowl of fries covered in some steamed greens, mushroom gravy and vegan \"cheese\". Oh, and sunflower seeds for some added crunch. Was I trying to be healthy? Absolutely not. Felt like there was something off about having a poutine with green leafy things in it, but the combination worked because I scarfed it down in no time.

My friend ordered the Buddha Bowl with Soba Noodles. We made it a Full Size, and it's more than enough for two people. It featured thai peanut sauce and we stopped reading the rest of the ingredients after that! Although it came with hefty portions, the flavour was a little bland. But here's a trick... 

The key thing to do is to ask for their hot sauce. It's made in-house and it's exactly what the noodles needed. I need to find out if they sell that hot sauce in jars... Or buckets..."}
{"text":"See my general review here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/fresh-toronto#hrid:BbeAK6nDbHB_6IhLXQChaQ

* Location note: Bloor tends to get much busier on weekends, but still turns tables around pretty well. The nicest bathrooms out of all the locations I think - a bit of a cramped waiting space for tables/takeout though."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Fresh restaurants. It is absolutely delicious food that you can also feel good about. I'm not strictly vegetarian or vegan yet these restaurants are still amongst my favourite and I look forward to return trips each and every time. I often only get the bowls, and am always well beyond satisfied, but their selection outside of these is also huge and likely just as amazing. Their juices and drinks are also super tasty and refreshing."}
{"text":"I've been putting off my review of Fresh for so long now, but the time has come that I can't put it off any longer.  It's not that I had a bad experience, just an all right one, and that has left me pretty unenthusiastic about reviewing it. 

The food was pretty good, but the wait was really long.  My party all had variations of the rice bowls- and maybe it's just me (and the fact that we eat whole foods at home) but it was a little bothersome to think that I could make everything I was eating at home for much much less, and everything would be just the way I liked it.  I didn't knock a star off for that, because that's a pretty silly complaint, but the prices were pretty expensive considering the ingredients going inside your meal.  I guess that's typical of vegetarian restaurants.  

I was also bothered that everything on the menu was extra. If you wanted a \"rice bowl\", it was $2.00 extra for the rice.  If you wanted a \"soba bowl\", it was $2.00 extra for the soba.  And those were your only two options.  So what exactly are you paying for with the base price of $7.00, Fresh? Renting a bowl to put the bean sprouts and cucumbers in before you choose rice or soba?  Come on. 

That said, I appreciate having a healthy, vegan friendly dining option in the city.  I have heard the burgers are quite good though, so perhaps I'll try that instead next time we are there.  But if I'm honest, if I'm with a group and we're finding a place to go I'd rather try somewhere new than hit Fresh again."}
{"text":"So SAD!!! Use to go to this place 2-3 a month. On this not so busy Wednesday, I decided to order something beside my regular staple of the Cali classic and went with a Buddha bowl... To my disappointment I when to mix it up and found a hair in it, stuck on my chop stick when I went to take my first bite. 
Yikes sent it back and another bowl came out really fast!!!  
After eating half of the bowl I found a quarter sized piece of glass in my bowl :(
Never going again!!!
And they only took my meal off the bill not my bf salad!! Rude"}
{"text":"I have to give this place props. I always head here when I'm home from a trip and inevitably craving vegetables. This places provides veggies.

That being said it's a pricey meal, and there is inevitably a wait. Service can also really vary depending on when you are there.

My favourite dishes are the Jerusalem Bowl, Green Goddess Bowl, and Superfood salad, but their burgers are also good. (I just never get them because when I go to Fresh I want fresh veggies.)

Also they do not deliver, but they used to offer a discount when you brought your own take out container, but I went on Thursday (after returning home from a month long business trip... directly to Fresh) they informed me that they no longer offer this discount."}
{"text":"This place is a perfect option if you are looking to have something quick and überhealthy.

I had the burger with grilled tempeh bacon, fresh 'cheese' sauce, garlic mayo, dill pickle, alfalfa sprouts, lettuce, tomato & red onion. Deeeliiiicioooooous!!!!!! Incredibly flavourful and filling, I was as satisfied as when eating a classic meat burger, this is delicious too AND way healthier.

I tried some of their sweet potato fries as appetizer, they were a bit soggy and I had to add a little bit more salt but as a snack they were ok.

Looking forward to go back and taste other menu options because their menu is huge and very varied."}
{"text":"I am not a vegetarian, or vegan, but was meeting a friend for lunch and am always open to trying somewhere new. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised and pleased by the meal and service we received.

The restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived, but we had no issue getting a seat, and the service was quick and attentive. I had a bean burrito and my friend ordered a veggie burger. The server was informative and gave us suggestions on popular sides and dipping sauces which turned out to be good choices. 

Our meal was prepared quickly and the portion sizes were huge and a good price for what you were receiving. The meal was great, and as a meat lover, I was left feeling more than satisfied with my veggie goodness. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"My brother and his girlfriend are both vegan, and they convinced me to go to Fresh, thank goodness they did. Aside from the fact that a meal and a drink can add up to upwards of $30 (which sure puts a dent in my bank account as a college student) I had no complaints."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. Perfect for a casual bite post work. I felt like I was being healthy all throughout the meal which whatever option I  chose. The flavour of everything was delicious especially the naan- like appetizer had nice flavour- and that is coming from a 100% meat lover here. I have always liked how they have a wide selection of juices and smoothies which are going to please any Taste bud. There are a few locations now so you'll be able to find a location that suits you."}
{"text":"Sadly, after going back on two more occasions I have to edit my review. Again, got my beloved veggie burger with kale slaw, and the kale was rotten, as was my friends. (we had take out so realized this once we were home) I went again this wk to give it another shot. They forgot to give me my kale and gave my friend the wrong soup. I suppose, I should have checked it in the restaurant before taking it home...but that move feels like such an a-hole tactic! So basically we spent almost $25 for a wrong order and missing kale. Boo hoo."}
{"text":"I love it here! It is unfortunately tight-spaced but the atmosphere is relaxing and friendly.  I love how you can colustomize your own drinks :) I'm not a vegan but I am convinced that I can live off of fresh fruits and vegetables! Both people and food are great! I've been here 4 times since I've discovered it a month and half ago. Price wise, it is debatable. If you are comparing a fresh burger with another burger at a different restaurant then of course it's cheaper here. But if you are comparing a salad then I would say they are similar in price range as to another supersalad from another place."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Fresh on Bloor over the weekend and had a really good experience. We ordered a cold pressed juice to share and two entrées. 

We started our meal by ordering the Urban Detox cold pressed juice made with kale, spinach, parsley, romaine, chard, apple, lemon, ginger, and cayenne. It tasted really good and my friend described it as similar to a Caesar because of the kick at the end due to the cayenne peppers. We both really liked this juice. It's the perfect detox juice for people who drink green smoothies regularly or for newbies who don't. My friend doesn't drink green smoothies and he really liked this juice. 

I ordered the macrobiotic rice bowl and really liked it. It's full of good for your nutrients like sauerkraut and other ingredients that are really good for gut health. In addition to all of these amazing nutrients, it tasted really delicious. I choose the Thai peanut sauce as a dressing and really enjoyed my dish. 

My friend ordered the All Star bowl and he said it was good but he preferred the falafel bowl, which is his go-to dish.

All over this location is really great. It was really easy to get a table and the employees were really friendly. I would definitely return to this location for another meal."}
{"text":"Access
It is pretty close to St. George subway station and as many of you know, this is UofT student territory lols. Anyhow it is SO busy, so prepare to wait in line around lunch time.

Service
It is difficult to describe this place in a few sentences. To begin, I wouldn't rate their service because it is almost irrelevant. I mean yes, it is important that they get your order and deliver food promptly but it's a quick-paced restaurant where people are mainly coming for the food. You are usually seated in a very small space so I can't see why anyone would want to stay for a long period of time. It is a really casual environment that works well for those who want to get in and get out.

Food
Since I came here for lunch, my friend and I didn't order much.

Quinoa onion rings $6.50 (hand-crafted, coated with breadcrumbs & puffed quinoa)
What the hell is this wonderful thing? I'm sure all of you love onion rings but you are totally missing out if you have never tried Quinoa-made onion rings. These rings are HUGE and although they are made from quinoa, the taste isn't too different. It is like the best thing I've eaten all week. It comes out fresh and warm, just the way I like it. Don't forget to dip them in the sauce.


Thai burger $11 (thai peanut sauce, tomato, lettuce, green onions, bean sprouts & cilantro)
Not many people know this but peanut butter adds a special kick to hamburgers. If you go to chains like The Works, it is something that they recommend to all the first-timers. In fact, peanut butter is frequently paired on veggie burgers. I was really not into the bun and I can't exactly explain why, so I only ate 1/4 of it. It's more hard than soft and perhaps I am just too used to white bread. This item is available bunless, so you can actually ask for it salad style."}
{"text":"This was one of my first experiences having western vegetarian food in a while.  I've had Chinese vegetarian food many times, and it really is hard to beat in terms of \"fake meat\".  The restaurant was packed for a late lunch on Sunday - I was told it's always busy.  I figured I'd give it a try as a healthy alternative.

I ordered the full breakfast.  It's tofu eggs, fake bacon or sausage, toast, home fries and beans.  Nothing too special, but I guess this is what you get with a breakfast that tries to simulate bacon and eggs.  The beans look like they came from a Heinz can and the home fries were bland.  The tempeh bacon was thick and tasted like a glorified hashbrown.  It was nothing close to a proper bacon substitute.  I ended up having to put ketchup on everything - although the hot sauce was pretty good.  The highlight was the tofu eggs, which were milky and soft and went well with the toast.  I also had the energize shake which was thick, tangy and a nice pick me up.  However, for $7 for 16oz you could  probably get a better option at a booster juice that includes protein powder.

Service was ok.  They took a while to take our order, but the restaurant was at capacity so it was acceptable.  Our water was also frequently refilled.

Overall, I left the restaurant full but very \"meh\".  Maybe I should have opted for the rice/noodle bowls, or maybe I just like my meat.  I wouldn't return unless I was making an exception for a vegetarian."}
{"text":"I honestly do not enjoy healthy vegan food, but this place made me change my mind after the first bite. Excellent food. Fresh is honestly fresh. Its that simple. I get their healthy juice with beets, apple and strawberries and its really filling. I normally get the yummy sweet potato fries and quinoa onion rings, their dipping chipotle sauce is awesome. For main I get the black bean burrito (i think), it tastes so good and I usually get full, after eating half. Unfortunately I never have room for dessert but definitly try this place out :)"}
{"text":"Had some dish with soba noodles (I think it was the green goddess bowl or some other bowl?), was sorely disappointed. Maybe it's healthy but it didn't taste good at all. Also terribly expensive, so it's not very good value in my opinion. Awesome atmosphere and interior design though."}
{"text":"This place is great, I used to go with my old roommate all the time as she was vegan and we could always rely on good vegan food and good service here. My favourite dishes include the Indian Dosas, the BBQ Burger, and the 'Poutine'. Make sure to call ahead of time and make reservations though because the wait can be extremely long and the place is almost always busy! I would also warn those looking for pop, or a greasy experience to stay away because you will be disappointed. I would recommend trying their super juices though - they are legendary."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.

My only other experience at fresh years ago, also at this location, was terrible. The noodles were mushy, the flavours bland. It was so unsatisfying that the memory of the experience turned my taste buds off for ages for this place.

Against my better judgment and because I wanted non-meat, my colleague and I came here for a really late lunch. The place was still rammed!  Don't people have to work, I said. Then I realized they were probably all lucky students. 

I have the noodles another try with 'the beach' bowl. I was totally sold by the avocado in the meal. In addition, the bowl had grilled peppers, sun dried tomatoes (I think), hearty grilled tofu, fresh sprouts and more. The noodles weren't over cooked and soggy! All in all, I left feeling like the meal rectified the poor experience I had before. The portions are huge in that there was a bounty of noodles. It's not worth it for me to come here during the height of lunch hour as I'm sure the wait would be more than I would be able to afford."}
{"text":"Quinoa onion rings were not greasy and crunchy. Batter was thick! so was the onion= delicious! thai burger I enjoyed the peanut sauce. Definitely had thai flavor in the burger which I have never tasted before IN A BURGER. The patty was slightly red which is a first for a veggie burger, I savored my meal at fresh. Service I received was kind. We went for lunch at a busy time. The restaurant was FILLED which implies to me that Fresh is is reputable and many people like dropping by for meals at Fresh!"}
{"text":"Green Goddess Bowl, Buddha Bowl, the veggie burgers, the juices....what's not to love. Whenever we're in Toronto, we hit one of the Fresh locations once daily for lunch and then a couple more times for fresh juice...Fresh got me hooked on sunflower sprouts. Fortunately, I was able to find a source near where I live to get my fix. Love their cookbooks as well."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend with some friends because they couldn't stop raving about it. We called ahead and placed an order for pick up. I ordered falafel tacos and quinoa onion rings with chipotle, both of which were delicious and left we feeling full. However, after we picked up our order we realized they forgot one order of onion rings so we called and let them know and then walked back to the store. It was a bit of a hassle but when we got there they were very apologetic and offered me and my friend a free juice for our trouble which we felt more than compensated as the cost of 2 juices is much more than the cost of the onion rings. Overall, I was very satisfied with the food and customer service. The only problem is that it can be very busy and crowded at this location."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Fresh.  I've been going here since about 2004 when I moved DT permanently.  A great place to ease suburban pallets into vegan/vegetarian food.  Every time I go I leave completely STUFFED.  The wait staff is generally nice but frequently overwhelmed.  If you go for dinner you usually have a 20 minute to 1/2 an hour wait.  

Best picks!
-the buddha bowl, and the baby buddha for lunch
-any of their desserts, they bring them in from Sweets from the Earth
-House organic red wine
-quinoa battered onion rings
-dosas
-thai burger

Totally worth the trip and wait!"}
{"text":"Tastes good, it's always packed so service can be a bit slow. Juice menu is ehh. It's what you'd expect of a basic juice bar. I always order the \"baby\" size of things, because thier portions are so big. It's pretty pricey-I'd rather pay half the money for half of the food. It may be vegan, but I don't want to walk out of your restaurant in a food coma! Cookies are dry, crumbly & gross, but the chocolate cake is divine. It's a bit cramped and always really loud, but it's a good place."}
{"text":"Generally, I'm not the biggest fan of vegan cuisine. I was a veggie for 6 years and gave it up for a reason...ahem. 

That being said...I was impressed with Fresh. 
I went there several times as a vegetarian and had mixed feelings about the place. Good once, bad then terrible then awful, then boycotted the place for years until today. OMG I totally regret it.

I had the soup and salad combo which was super duper delish and then the revitalizing veggie smoothie with a E2 shot which was like nothing Ive ever had before. Definitely a kicker.

Suppppper yuuum. Healthy, yummy, decently priced, full of weird hipsters...perfect for the Annex :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent cheese sauce, peanut sauce, poutine. I also had an energy shake it was all very good"}
{"text":"Tried this place with a friend who recommended it. Went in with no idea or expectations as I am not a vegetarian. Surprisingly was happy with the menu. I tried the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Wrap which was good. Fresh ingredients and very filling. We had onion rings for starters and the chipotle mayo dip was too good! Nice ambience and friendly servers, it was a good experience. Good for someone looking for light and fresh meal. Recommended."}
{"text":"Love it

Me and my bestie have met up here a couple times and we love their shakes and burritos.  The quinoa onion rings are so good and you don't feel THAT guilty after having some.

I find the bowls too heavy - but that's just my opinion and lots of people like them.

If you are looking for something healthy but fun, go to Fresh."}
{"text":"I got the soup, salad and cornbread combo with hummus. the soup tasted like chilli and was very good. The restaurant lives up to its name, haha the salad really was fresh. I had the peanut and lime dressing. I like how they separate the dressing from the salad because you really only need about half of what they give you, but it's nice to have a bit extra for your own home made salads.The hummus is yummy, not too heavy. The service is also pretty fast. You can call in advance to make an order for pick up."}
{"text":"Always friendly and attentive service as well as consistently delicious food. The Tangled Thai salad with Crispy Tofu Cubes is my summertime fave : )"}
{"text":"I'm in love! The green poutine is so good subbed with sweet potato fries (this is what I'll be coming back for). And the bowls are packed with tasty ingredients that leave you guilt free by the end of the meal. The thing is that you could probably make yourself one of these bowls at home (if you want to put in the work of grilling and roasting vegetables). They do give you a good portion though and I had some healthy leftovers ! 
Service was good, but it was super busy inside and the tables are very close together. 
If you haven't had fresh yet, make some room in your schedule!"}
{"text":"I'm no vegetarian or vegan, in fact, quite the opposite.  If you find me here, I'm probably with Danielle P or Nicole H.  I've been to this particular Fresh six times, so I think I'm still somewhat qualified to critique this fine establishment.

The food has always been sumptuously superb; my favourites being the Mint Mocha smoothie and their selection of fresh salads.  I'm also a huge fan of the yam-fries with miso dip.  

I can stuff my fat face all under the pretense of healthful eating.

In addition to the amazing vittles, the servers have always been attentive and amiable.

I only have one criticism, and it's not of the restaurant.  For some unknown reason, Fresh seems to act as kind of a douche-magnet, attracting every asshole within 20 kilometers.  Have you ever looked at someone and thought \"man, that person just looks like a ... dick.\"  You can't explain it, they just have dick face.  I've noticed this each time I've been here, whether for lunch or dinner.  Could it be a heightened sense of self importance  caused by their choice not to eat meat?  Are they pissed because they just paid $9 for a smoothie?  

If anyone can shed some light on this subject I'd appreciate it."}
{"text":"To be honest, I find the amount of 3 stars this place gets on Yelp quite disappointing. 
In my mind Fresh is a strongly mainstreamed version of several fairly great rare-find and mostly vegan places in Kensington Market put together and well, actually advertised.  
THE MENU is decent. I can definitely understand the carnivore crowd disliking the place, since Fresh doesn't really bother attempting to make anything at all taste like meat; and I also do hear the gourmet herbivore crowd blaming it for being boring, -- most of the options on the menu do indeed suggest the combination of quinoa and tofu, while the more creative ones are centred around goji berries and lime dressing etc. Read: if you are looking for really meat-like meatless burgers or a truly eye-opening vegan experience, you probably won't enjoy Fresh. That being said, if you crave a nicely made, simple, gluten free lunch or dinner low in carbohydrates and rich in vegetable fibre, -- Fresh is definitely a place to get it. 
The salad bowls are enormous enough to be split between two. My personal favourite is the All Star Salad, that is yes again, made of quinoa and adzuki beans, goji berries, greens and nuts, and served with some nicely grilled sweet potato and tofu steaks. The burgers seem to be equally good and are served with a very generous amount of add-ons (yet again, -- enough to be split with your lunch date.) Now, the drinks are tricky. They are something I have a love-hate relationship with, because as much as I do love Fresh's citrus + cherry urgent-C immune booster, I do recognise that paying exactly as much as would normally pay for the entire meal for just a single drink is slightly ridiculous.
THE WAIT. In my experience, Fresh pretty much always equals a waiting list. The rare exclusions include breakfast, late lunch and a couple of hours before the kitchen shuts down. Surprisingly, - a line of up to twelve people before you has a magical capacity of vanishing in about 20 minutes. Once you're seated though -- everything is uber fast. I believe it depends on your order, but I'd say the longest I ever waited for food was about 10 minutes, when the place was packed, and there were four of us to be served at the table. 
THE STAFF is simply amazing. It is usually a crowd of five or more incredibly friendly hipsterly dressed young people that circle around the room answering all sorts of questions about food and beyond, suggesting better meals variations and serving the tables notably fast.
THE ATMOSPHERE here is always busy. It's very dynamic, a little noisy, and as you have probably figured from previous reviews, -- the space in between the tables is kind of non-existent. This might be both a plus (if, say, you are looking for a place to meet up with a friend during a lunch break and have a nice conversion without zoning out of the work mode too much) and a minus (in case you're tired and actually do want to zone out.)
THE PRICE. Expect to pay around 12 dollars for a huge bowl of salad (12.50 for a combo of a side salad and a soup special + cornbread), 10 dollars on average for a burger or a wrap, and 3 to 5 dollars for add-ons. The drinks, as I mentioned before, are infamously overpriced, - they would average on 15 dollars for a large glass of vegetable juice."}
{"text":"YUM. 

It bugs me these days when people are scared of Vegetarian restaurants, saying it's not Hearty enough, or not enough sustenance, or say that they don't want to pay $10 bucks for just a salad.  a) depends what you order b) there is so much more to Veggie food than just leaves

That being said, Fresh is one of those places that you can get full up and waddle out of the restaurant without feeling like a greaseball. 

We came on a Wednesday night. They don't take reservations, and for out table of 6 we were told to wait an hour. 5 mins later, that became half and hour. 10 mins later, we were seated. how nice! Don't be deterred by all the people in the hallway or on the benches. Most are just waiting for takeout. 

The menu has tons of variety. Salads, Wraps, Sandwiches, Bowls of rice or noodles, burgers, and plenty of starters.  For those with allergies, ask for the gluten free menu - it lists out all the ingredients for everything in a dish in detail, and offers substitutions. 

Things to order:
QUINOA BATTERED ONION RINGS ($5). I've never had a crunchier onion ring, I don't know how they do it. 
SWEET POTATO FRIES ($5) good to share and comes with a choice of dipping sauce

THAI BURGER A friend of mine loves this veggie burger, but perhaps an acquired taste because another friend said she wasn't fond of the texture

FRESH BOWLS I think these are the only reason I come here.  Most are $11-15 for a regular size.  Today I had the Energy Bowl with rice - chickpea stew, thai curry + other veggies and things.  It was quite yummy.  I tend to lean towards the one with the sauce in it, as I was afraid that without it, it would be too dry.  My boyfriend got the Jerusalem bowl, which didn't have any type of sauce except tahini, and it not dry at all! It was quite yummy, and very 'fresh' and 'clean' tasting. 

I don't know why it's so hard to convince people to come here, but I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was at Fresh a couple weeks ago. It was my first visit, but I had heard about it before. I am not one to seek out Vegan/Vegetarian cuisine, however, I was pleasantly surprised with my meal. The menu was more than overwhelming, there are so many choices! I ended up ordering the Chipotle Bacon Burger (that's tempeh bacon), adding avocado and aged cheddar cheese. The burger itself is huge, so $11.50 for the burger is decent. However, my add-ons were $2 and $2.25 respectively, so in the end, I had ended up spending the most money I had ever shelled out for a burger; and this one didn't even have meat in it! I think I will visit again but I don't feel like this place is worth the price. At least not to a meat lover like myself."}
{"text":"I love the Baby Energy bowl! I'm not a big eater, and I think this is just the right size for a filling meal... but of course I always have to make more room for their sweet potato fries with the peanut sauce. Mmmmm, addictive. 

I don't know how they get the tofu to taste so wonderful, and everything to taste so refreshing and wholesome. It seems very simple, and it likely is, but they definitely have it down to a science. Well... mostly, anyways. It can vary. 

That brings me to the negatives: I've been here quite a few times, and I've always ordered the same thing. Over time it has become more expensive and occasionally it seems thrown together without the right proportions and care it should have. The last time they gave me a TON of sprouts on top, and not so much sauce (my favourite part) or vegetables, which was disappointing. 

I also had the carrot soup once and it was nothing special. In fact, it was somewhat unpleasant because it had small pieces of carrot in it. 

To summarize: Even though I'm not vegan/vegetarian, I still look forward to coming here on occasion because of their awesome, addictive sauces."}
{"text":"Good food and good atmosphere. Committed to real vegetarian, local and organic selections."}
{"text":"I know people who love Fresh and I simply do not get it. The place is overpriced and the food just isn't that good.

And I am not saying this as someone who does not get that vegetarian food can be good. I eat vegetarian approximately 75% of the time and i simply have not ever loved anything that I had at Fresh other than the blended juices which are overpriced, but delicious. 

The one good thing that has come out of Fresh is a peanut-lime sauce that I have co-opted, changed up, and now use when I make stir fry. I do love it when I make it at home."}
{"text":"Food quality is good but overpriced. 18 bucks for a bowl of rice with veggies. Service is pretty slow."}
{"text":"Such awesome fresh vegetarian fare! I enjoyed the Grapefruit Glow for my drink... tangy and sassy, it packs a punch! And I had the bunless veggie burger in a salad, topped with tempeh-bacon. Nutritious, low-carb, and tasty - what more could this vegetarian ask for? Close to the museums, too - bonus!"}
{"text":"I had this place in my bookmark for a while and I finally decided to check it out.

I ordered their onions & mushrooms burger, it's tasty and light, more on the healthy side. I also ordered their onion rings and I strongly recommend them.

Most of the menu is vegan. The few non vegan items are marked with green asterisks. Service is friendly.

While the place is mainly famous for healthy salads and bowls, they do have a decent selection of bar foods. I surely recommend that you check this place out."}
{"text":"I've attempted to come here many times but decided that crowd isn't worth the wait.  Finally, coming here for an extremely early dinner (5:30pm), this place was not quite half full.  Success!  I've been looking to eat healthy for a while now and found out about this place a while back but didn't really look into the menu.  I had no idea this place was vegetarian.  Needless to say, I was pretty surprised when my girlfriend's burger came meatless.  I just figured it was a healthy restaurant.

What can I say?  Well, upon entering I was greeted immediately and escorted to a table.  Staff was really nice and helpful.  Food was filling and quite tasty and after the meal, I was neither hungry, nor did I feel like a fat slob after eating (such as when I eat Wendy's).  I got gotten the soup, salad and cornbread combo with a side of hummus and my girl friend had gotten the B.B.Q. Burger with a side of coleslaw.  Food was colorful, bright, delicious and full of flavor.

Corn bread was interesting.  It crumbled so easily and kind of reminded me of the flavor of the Frito Lay corn chips minus the crazy grease.  Very yummy but seemed a bit too dry.  First time ever having cornbread, not sure if it's supposed to be like that.  The soup, I couldn't actually tell you what kind it was that day but it had a bit of spice similar to that of a curry (cumin, coriander , turmeric, etc) but I personally felt it was a touch salty.  Regardless I still hoovered the whole thing.  The salad with house dressing was nice and fresh.  It had edemame, cucumber, kale and the other stuff you would get in the spring mix packages in a grocery store.  That was probably the worst part of my dish but the house dressing made it much better.  A bit of sweet, a bit of sour and just delicious all over.

My girlfriend got the BBQ burger with a side of coleslaw.  This burger was topped with a tomato, banana peppers, garlic mayo (which was so good I would eat from a spoon), 2 quinoa battered onion rings, some bbq sauce and the meatless, vegan patty.  I really enjoyed the onion rings on the burger as well as the garlic mayo.  If I can order just the onion rings next time I think I'm going to.  The burger overall was delicious but yeah, I think I really enjoyed the rings more than I did the patty.  My girlfriend loved this burger.  I had a couple bites but am convinced I would have been happier eating beef but I guess people don't really come here for that.  I have a vegetarian friend and I'm not sure if she's ever heard of this place but I just found a new place we can eat comfortably together.  I will definitely be back here.  I was quite satisfied with my meal considering I am an all out meat lover.  I literally came here looking for meat.  As I said earlier, I figured it was just a \"healthy\" restaurant, not vegetarian.  Anyway, food was good, price was great (both our meals, no drinks $21), so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite restaurant in Toronto.
The food is so so so good, I love the HUGE menu and it's such a rare treat when I can eat everything on the menu and literally everything I have tried has been amazing.
Great service. Always busy."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and like their food. Their customer service on the other hand is very bad. My two friends and I were told the wait would be around 15 minutes if not less, but we waited for 40 minutes until we got a seat. We ordered right away but it took another 25 minutes for the food to come.

Now here's what I've tried: 
1. Bread, olives and dukkah: 7/10. This was actually very tasty at first, but after the first few bites I couldn't have anymore. It's just too salty! I'd recommend getting this if you're in a big group of people where you won't have to go past a few bites. 
2. Sweet potato with chipotle mayo sauce: 9/10. I love this so much. Especially because it's healthier than from other restaurants yet it tastes pretty much the same if not better
3. Macro greens with tahini sauce: 7/10. This was extremely healthy. The sauce and practically whole dish were green. I just wish the taste was a bit better 
4. Energy bowl with brown rice: 7.5/10. This was also very healthy but I liked the taste a bit more than the macro greens."}
{"text":"So I have frequented the Bloor location a few times.

I can not see past the Fresh bowls, especially the baby beach - I am a fan of anything with goats cheese though! Reading other reviews I really need to ask for hot sauce next time! 

Before the GF diet, i had the spring rolls, those were super tasty. I LOVE the sweet ginger tea and could happily drink it forever!

I love this place, I can eat here pretty much guilt free! 

Bliss"}
{"text":"I do still love Fresh, but the service is starting to get a bit stale. The last two times I ordered take out, I arrived home only to learn parts of my order were missing. First, I was missing one burger, and now I was missing two side salads. I certainly don't appreciate sloppy service on my take out orders. Keep it together, Fresh. Two stars for poor service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food at Fresh, and am happy there's one so close to U of T. The service is good, they provide water bottles on the table, the food is always so fresh and tasty, and the serving sizes are generous. I'm not a vegan, or even a vegetarian, but I find I don't miss the animal products at all. 

My only complaint (making it a 4 rather than 5 star review) is that the space is very tight inside, and when it's busy (and it's almost always busy!) it  an feel very cramped and get very, very loud. But I guess that's the trade off for a convenient location, so it isn't terrible."}
{"text":"Love at first bite. Love at first sight. It's unusual for a meatlovin' carnivoric consumer like me to say these things about a veggie centric restaurant. But it's true. I absolutely loved Fresh. Vegetarian food never dawned on me as satisfying. I typically crave meat after any vegetarian meal I eat. However, I didn't here, oh no, it was filling and tasty enough to make my meat obsession a delicious juicy memory.

I ordered the All Star salad. Visually, it's what I like about a salad. A hippie's kitchen sink, a bit of everything thrown into bowl with, I recommend peanut lime, choice dressing. Insanely good with seeds, nuts, leaves, shoots, quinoa, sweet potatoes and tofu. Eating a garden party had never been so textual and flavorful. Every bite is different, your chopsticks ( super weird utensils included to eat quinoa) simply can't lift everything with each snatch. Eat wisely and spread out your sweet potatoes.

While sitting here, I slowly felt healthier. Obviously psychologically more than anything, but I felt good. The atmosphere was unpretentious and not full of handle bar mustaches and sock hats. It was bright, cozy and busy. 

Fresh made me rethink of vegetarianism. Would I ever switch? Will I convert to a green and fresh diet? My stomach says never, but my mind and heart say, \"Eat here more, you'll thank us later\"."}
{"text":"I mean WHAT!?
How come they don't have 5starts?????

From the hello when I came in to the bye when I left it as GRANDIOSE!
 
I got help picking from the menu as I didn't I ow the place. I got a bowl. OMG!!! On of the best vegan bowl I ve ever had! (I travel all over the place and do them all!)

This was truly the best place cause they have so much choices!!! Service was on time and the size are generous! (the small bowl is giant!)

Thank you and you ll see me again cause I need to taste everything else!!!"}
{"text":"It's a fact that omnivores go nuts for the Fresh chain of vegetarian (it's not wholly vegan) restaurants. It doesn't matter what location of Fresh you visit, the place is always jam packed with people who are searching for something healthier than their normal fare. But make no mistake, that the vast majority of people who come to eat here are not vegan or vegetarian and frankly, I don't think they know they're being cheated by Fresh's substandard offerings.

While I consider Fresh a good fall-back dinner choice for take-out, with so much awesome veggie food in this city, like One Love, which is one subway stop away, I just can't bring myself to eat here most of the time. Live Food Bar also isn't far, at Dupont & Spadina and makes for a way better date experience. Greens, E.L. Ruddy, Hogtown Vegan, Loving Hut, Urban Herbivore, all heavy hitters in my books, but not Fresh.

So, why the lack of love from this herbivore? The meals are just very uninspired and they are made in a half-hearted manner, assembly line style and it shows in the presentation and taste. I constantly see ads on Craigslist for line cooks for Fresh, so the turn-over in the kitchen must be high. I don't blame them, it's the McDonald's of vegetarian food. Sometimes popularity is a curse? 

Buddha bowls and Green Goddess' taste just like several people each tossed one thing into a bowl in layers, with no thought about the cohesion of the meal. The ingredients are not organic and aren't always the best quality. I also give great importance to dressings when you're eating this style of healthy veg food, and Fresh really disappoints in this area.

Over a decade ago I had my first ever vegetarian dining experience at the first Fresh on Bloor, when it was a quarter the size, near Bathurst - now long since a sushi joint. And guess what? It sucked. I had a mediocre smoothie and a weird hippie pizza and never returned (they don't do the pizza thing anymore, as far as I know but surprisingly the atmosphere was vastly better. It was dark, intimate, and definitely cool, think Queen West West of today). 

That experience put me on a 5 year stint of never bothering to try vegetarian places, despite being vegetarian, because I figured everything would taste as bland as a hummus pizza. Why would I settle for that? 

Part of me really wants to love Fresh and in a way I think I do. My love for Aux Vivres, Montreal's hipper cafe cousin (there's no affiliation) is exactly what Fresh is trying (or pretending?) to be. The dishes are clearly planned and created by a chef with care and attention paid to what the final product will be. If you're ever in MTL, try it and you'll see exactly what I mean.

Fresh remains good at a couple of things in my books. A quick soup and bread meal - though overpriced, can be really good at times. They are also conveniently located and if you get take-out, it's fairly painless process. You even get a 15% discount if you have a TVA Veg Discount card, something 99% of Fresh's patrons don't have because they aren't vegetarian. But for someone who eats veg all the time, it's just really falls short in the taste and flavour department.

I'm glad it remains packed with students and Miles Nadel gym-goers who dine solo with headphones on. But make no mistakes, this is without a doubt the favourite vegetarian restaurant of Toronto omnivores (even most of the staff aren't veggie). 

It's 'vanilla' vegetarian food that is lacking interest and inspiration. I think a lot of people leave here thinking, 'Well, I endured that bland meal for the good of my body' and wake up the next day to buy a fat and cholesterol packed breakfast sandwich, never knowing what delicious vegetarian offerings they are missing.

2.5 stars - Needs improvement on food quality and flavour. Atmosphere is cafeteria-style, loud, and crowded. Prices aren't great considering the food is just egh."}
{"text":"I love Fresh - one of favourite places to go hands-down for brunch and dinner. I have NEVER had a bad experience here - very consistent. The service is always great and the food on point. They have enough variety to keep me interested in coming back, without overcrowding the menu. 

Their soups are amazing. I love the bowls - they are filling and offer a lots of toppings. The hot sauce is also excellent! Burgers are great - I find veggie burgers can be such a hit or miss, but the one's at Fresh are definitely worth trying. As for dessert - carrot cake is a must have!

My only criticism of this place is the layout. It is too packed. I would rather wait longer to be seated for my meal, than be elbow to elbow with strangers. On a busy night, I can't even hear the person across from me because the next table is so close. It is hard to have any kind of personal conversation! I wish they would take a few of the tables along the wall out to create a more welcoming dining experience. The place isn't cheap persay, and sometimes the ambiance for the price point is a bit of a turn off. However, the service and food do make up for it!

I recommend Fresh to vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. I always leave, feeling full but never too much."}
{"text":"Many years later eating here again, I still love Fresh on Bloor. I love the kale salad, and atmosphere, and fruit drinks. Te service is decent and its all together great to eat here. This time I went to Fresh on bloor I have All Hale Kale, and a fruit drink which had grapefruit cilantro  and delicious  stuff. I would go here again. I really like eating here."}
{"text":"I love FRESH. It has so much healthy food that also tasted good and looks nice. Try to cook that at home and see how much time you will spend on every meal. 
A bit too busy and noisy - but I guess it's a good thing."}
{"text":"I don't go more than a week and a half without having at least a meal from Fresh, whether it be at this location or through an UberEats or Foodora delivery. I absolutely adore Fresh - it's a vegetarian/health nut's haven. Their service is always friendly and although the restaurant is always busy, they never rush you. This is something I especially appreciate as I like coming here alone a lot.  My favorite dish is their beach bowl with tofu steaks - and their homemade hot sauce is a must. 

Gotta admit though, not a big fan of their scrambled tofu, which is featured in most of their brunch dishes."}
{"text":"came here again its been a while.
we ordered take out at the last minute literally 10mins before close.  apprecited that even though they were closing quality of food was up to par.

the chicken tenders taste like dog food."}
{"text":"Not going to lie I was REALLY worried that once my mom friend and I busted in there with our moderate sized strollers that they were going to give us the vegetarian stink eye.

Is it just me or is there just *something* about the staff there that screams just a wee bit pretentious?

But I was very happily wrong! Not only did they seat us at a table that had enough room for both of our strollers, they moved stuff around to make it easily accessible (and this fresh is pretty narrow). 

The only thing is that I wish when we sat down they would have told us that they had a change table in the accessible washroom because I had just finished changing the kid and one of the waiters came by and was acting all uncomfortable and said \"Uuuum....yea are you changing him or changing his pants?\" (like I would just randomly change a babies pants? I don't know) \"Because there's a change room in the washroom.\"

I told him I was just changing his pants. Which is retarded but it made him go away. I think he was worried about seeing baby penis? Who knows. 

Anyway, I truly love their food there even if it needs more bacon."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best vegan restaurants in Toronto! The food is exceptional, and so is the service. I ordered the macrobiotic bowl with 369 dressing and soba noodles, which was amazing. It's a little pricey, but they don't skimp on the portion size. My dining partners (both of which are omnivores) thoroughly enjoyed their meals as well. The only downside to the restaurant is the fact that the eating area resembles a cafeteria (the tables are far too close to one another and it's quite noisy).

Bottom line: if you're looking for a restaurant that serves tasty, healthy vegan fare and you don't care too much for ambiance, then Fresh is for you."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 8  (Bad idea)
Didn't know this place was just a vegetarian place (I looked at my friends baffled, I need my protein in beef/chicken/pork form please.)

One of members who arrived early asked for a table of 8... it took 115 minutes before they managed to fit our group in.  (maybe because they forgot about us or because people come here in groups of 2-4 and are easier to sit.)  No apology was given for the wait.

We had someone in our group who had a medical issue and required that salt not be added... it was added and had to be prepared again.
Fruit drinks were not fresh even though the waitress initially said they were.
Some Salads not dressed very well.
Someone I believe got the wrong order.
Its bad when people are offering their their meal to me because they didn't like what they had. (What!? do i look like my dog who will eat any scraps that is served my way because you didn't like it.... however i did finish her salad.  I was hungry.) 

At the end, one of our foodies wrote a letter of complaint to their head office... The head office thought the server should have given us complementary drinks after the long wait/mixup ... and even offered to refund our bills if we brought back our receipts (based on the mistakes that occurred.)

Fresh's food is better than the 2 star rating that i am giving it (and i'm sure vegans love this place)... but based on the experience our group had... i will not come back here with a group greater than 4.  The place can't handle big table orders... and staff need to realize when a bad experience is happening and try to rectify it before the mistakes keep adding up."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. They have a lot of variety including wraps, tacos, burgers, salads, bowls. Their quinoa onion rings and poutine are great. They use Miso gravy. Your don't feel too bad after eating here!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend and was interested in trying the Thai Burger served with kale slaw.  From that day on since visiting, I never knew what I was missing!  The veggie burger was delicious and exceeded my expectations.  I have decided that I might try being a vegetarian, but I know that with enough research I can at least cut back on meats and stuff like that.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Hope to visit the other locations as well."}
{"text":"Fabulous fresh, wholesome vegetarian food. A few meals at this place and you can almost feel yourself getting healthier (though the fact that they refuse to give out calorie/fat information makes me a little wary as vegetarians/vegans already have a marked problem with cholesterol due to the amount of nuts consumed).
ANYWAY, whether your hungover or sick or just need to water those vocal cords, a hefty part of the drink selection is advertised like a medicine cabinet (flu fighter, liver flush, singer's saving grace....). The vegetable juices are healthy and a great way to justify a side of fries or dessert. I myself prefer the following smoothies: chai chiller or mango ginger lassi.

On to the FOOD!
The rice bowls are huge and fabulous. You can't really go wrong with any of them, just make sure that you like the ingredients. The energy and buddha bowls are my favorite. The energy bowl (along with the warrior one too) is warm and savory - perfect for a chilly day or as comfort food. The buddha bowl is served cool but is loaded with a fabulous thai peanut sauce that gives me my peanut fix and silences my yearning for decent pad thai in this city. 
The burgers are all pretty good. The patties like grain and vegetable and have a very homemade feel as opposed to the typical veggie soy glue served elsewhere. The BBQ burger, I must warn, is rather crunchy and dry so get extra sauce or something added. The mushroom burger is the best and I just ask for extra sauces from the BBQ one. 
The wraps are really solid particularly the avocado and tofu one. I highly recommend adding the toasted nuts and seeds to give a perfect crunch. 

MINUS one star for being too rigid when it comes to customizing. Getting them to replace sprouts with even lettuce renders me an extra few dollars on my bill for a \"substitution.\" Seriously, lettuce for sprouts? Or grilled tomato for raw tomato.  
It's also hard not to pick up on the slight haughtiness that the vegetarian-environmentalist IMF-protesting egalitarian staff exude. I think it adds to that typical hippie vibe."}
{"text":"I've been in here a few times (and once in the Eglinton and Spadina locations as well). I've enjoyed almost all that I've tried. The quinoa onion rings are to die for. I love the BBQ burger. I like when veggie burgers don't try to be meat but are instead their own thing. I love the burgers at Fresh. The All Star kale salad is awesome and I love that if you ask to omit something they'll give you double of something else to replace it.

The only things I don't like are the soba noodles. If you have a bowl, go for the rice. The falafel tacos were also disappointing. Fairly plain and bland.

Service is usually good if sometimes slow because of how busy it gets.
The place is usually packed so it's best to go after \"lunch time\" or before dinner.

I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers! I love the BBQ burger and can almost never bring myself to order anything else. Loud environment, often quite crowded, and not cheap. But large, filling servings of delicious food with quick and friendly service. Expect a wait for walk ins on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"Fresh has been around for a few years and it hasn't changed much at all! The store is very full, so it can be a bit of an uncomfortable place at times. However, the smoothies are great! I would definitely recommend stopping by for a smoothie for the road. There are a lot of great flavours and blends and they're made with great ingredients.

The food is also great. I love the bowls in particular. The baby size is great for one and the full size can be good for sharing along with some appetizers. Some of the options can be a bit bean heavy so I would recommend ordering carefully. 

Definitely worth a stop if you're with vegans or vegetarians -- they'll be awestruck by all the options."}
{"text":"Fabulous salads! The superfood with house dressing is my go-to healthy lunch at work. I wish they published their nutritional information, though. The takeout is easy and usually quick if you call ahead with your order.

The loss of a star is a service issue. I took a friend there who had never been to a vegetarian restaurant (she's from Texas) and the waiter was crazy rude to her upon learning she was not converting to vegetarianism just because she visited a vegetarian restaurant one time. I'm not impressed by businesses that hire self-important hipsters who feel the need to pass judgment on their customers. However, that was the only time I've had a problem like that there."}
{"text":"Fresh is a vegetarian restaurant and one of my wife's favourite places. 
We Ordered the tofu wrap, sweet potato fries and a cleanse juice. The food was good but a little bit pricy in my opinion. All of the above cost about $30 when you factor the tip to the waitress. 
If you're a vegetarian then you probably eat here a lot. Or at least you should."}
{"text":"Been there 2 days in a row since someone told me about this place close to one of our work offices.

Day one had their mushroom burger with a berry whip. I could have ate a whole spoon of just their coconut whip cream, but I remained professional. The smoothie and burger were both decent but it was their hot sauce that won me over. Flavorful, and not just packing heat although it was pretty spicy. 

The next day I came back for their buffalo chick'n wrap and hot sauce. Got to try their delicious vanilla cupcake while waiting and it was soft and perfectly sweet... the free part might be biasing me. 

The prices are pretty high but the food is fresh and delicious. 

Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Thanks to my wonderful daughter for suggesting we go to this place.

Green Detox and Negril Beach smoothies, California Classic wt green dressing and Superfood wt house dressing salads, LARGE Quinoa Onion Rings and Avocado Chipotle dip at its best...  Loved it all!!!

Can't wait to go back and try something else.  The hot sauce is just amazing.  The best I ever had."}
{"text":"When I stopped being vegetarian it wasn't just because sweet sweet bacon called my name, it was because I moved far away from Fresh. I pretty much lived at this place at one time. 
Simply put one of the best vegetarian restaurants I have ever been to, and I have been to lot of them!

Although, yes, it can get crowded at times and the tables are a little close together for Toronto standards, but having now lived in NYC for 7 years this fact doesn't bother me one single bit.

Now one might think salads, tofu, grain bowls, and grilled veggies when it comes to  vegetarian/vegan food and yes FResh has all those yummy things, but the real stand outs on their menu could make even a T-Rex loves veggies!

They make a tasty, moist, BBQ burger that I can't even begin to tell you how amazing it is. Just get it and thank me later!
They have crispy, fluffy french fries that come with this uber amazing vegan garlic mayo on the side.....you  might end up asking for extra on the side!
Fresh also makes the best onion rings I have ever had! Seriously! 
Throw in great brunch pancakes, perfectly made vegan deserts and Fresh is a great place to get your veggies and a whole lot more!"}
{"text":"I never EVER get sick of going here and you can t possibly feel guilty ;)

They always have specials if you find you keep going back to the same thing. The staff are high on wheat grass and super friendly. Try the date-almond smoothy!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. I'm a vegetarian that used to live nearby. Overall I find the place is overrated and there are better vegetarian restaurants in town (e.g. Grasshopper, Planta, King's Cafe).

That said, they have the best onion rings I've ever had. Their dosas are good. Most of their options are okay but not amazing. Their desserts are not very good."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written this place up yet! 

Fresh is the place I go to when...

- I need to feel \"clean\", or \"detox\" from a bad week/day/month of overindulgence 

- I have an audition/tryout to attend the next day (or a few days before) and it involves wearing a bathing suit or something really form fitting

- I feel like boycotting meat

IN Vancouver, my favourite place is The Naam (open 24/7, all veggies!) so when I arrived in TO, I set out hunting for the next cool veghead place.

And so far, Fresh fills my veggie void. It's not overly expensive (though anyone would surely feel a tad ripped off paying $9 for a bowl of steamed veggies).

You can order tons of sides at $2-4 (hello, yam fries? normal fries? steam broccoli, kale, etc.). I like this arrangement, because if I'm feeling a little naughty, a small side of fries won't kill me, but an appy-sized plate of fries probably would make my butt and thighs upset.

Anyway - I digress. When you get there and if you're bringing out-of-towners, order the Quinoa battered onion rings. It looks interesting/impressive, very unique - you only get 5 bigass rings but trust me, they are worth it and if you start off with those, you won't be able to finish your meal.

Now, for your meal, I highly recommend one of their bowls. And if you get it with rice, request \"more veggies than rice\" - they are good at fulfilling that request. Buddha and Goddess are the best ones, and same with the Macrobiotic (micro?) bowl... clean and simple!

OH - and the soup. Oh, the soup. SOmetimes I'll just go for the soup - a cup or a bowl or a bowl with salad. The soup is great, its just pureed veg at the end of the day but my fave is the Jamaican spinach and zucchini - a lil spicy but great spices. Their soups are always good and they change all the time. 

They also have a prix fixe which includes a smoothie (pure fruit and goodness), appy, entree and dessert all for $21. YOu can't lose!"}
{"text":"I love Fresh! Such a great veggie spot that's good for non-vegetarians alike. I'm a big fan of their bowls (buddah bowl with crispy tofu is my fave) and their wraps are incredible too (holiday with crispy tofu and clubhouse are delish). Their crispy tofu is soooo good and you can substitute any of the protein in any of the meals, which I would highly recommend doing!! Their other tofu is ok but the crispy is the best. Their fries are also really tasty and get the garlic mayo dipping sauce!!!! The one thing that I didn't like here was the tofu scramble which is available for brunch. Everything else I've tried has been amazing."}
{"text":"While waiting in line for a concert at St. Paul's Trinity Church, a friendly fellow in line suggested that we walk down and go to Fresh for lunch.  A simple recommendation easily became one of the highlights of the trip.

I'm not vegetarian or vegan - but that said, I'm a connoisseur of veggie burgers.  My vegan burger was the 2nd best I've ever had in my life.  Blew my mind.

My wife's wrap wasn't anything to write home about, but it did live up to the Fresh name and didn't make her feel lethargic like some pizza would have.

Nice bathrooms to boot - although that toilet stall was easily the most dark stall I've ever been in.  (Super cool, though.)

A tad pricey - but so very worth it overall.  Go and treat yourself right someday on your stay on Bloor Street."}
{"text":"One of the reasons this gets such a high rating is because this is the only truly vegetarian restaurants I've been to. First of all, I am definitely NOT a vegetarian. I like my meat. However, after going to Fresh for a lunch a couple times, I didn't find myself missing out.

The first time I went, I was running late, so I had my uncle order something for me. He picked out the Thai peanut burger. I wouldn't order anything else. It's not your usual dried-out wimpy veggie burger. This thing has some serious flavour. Even the slaw on the side it's served with is delicious.

Not a place I'm likely to go often, but a real treat when I do. If you're heading in for lunch on a week day, expect to have a bit of wait. It sure gets busy, and I can see why."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian, but I absolutely love this place.  Their dishes are delicious and so creative.  It gets a bit crammed, the service is alright, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This place has huge menu. This is second big vegan restaurant i have been to after Ethos Vegan in Orlando, FL. This is good place for Vegan and Vegetarians because many options. Food quality is good. I've been there 3 times, you have to wait 30 minutes after pacing your order. Price of every item in menu is higher"}
{"text":"Fresh, open late on Sunday in its bloor location, has become a go to Sunday Dinner spot for us.  It has a granola, university, 'I have a lot of rules about food' vibe to it.  Always packed, often with a line, and good for a well priced healthy dinner. 

We love the bowls, the salad and I have a soft spot for the BBQ burger...though I think it is really the onion rings. The food is packed with flavour, very 'fresh' and very filling for veggie fair.  I love how picky you can be - everything is customizable and highly recommend their soups...always delish.

I always get a refresher juice...makes me feel like a better person.  My BF loves the shoosh, which tastes like a banana chocolate milkshake.

Not for a night out, but good for a girls dinner, pre-movie or late lunch...or come on Sunday night...we will likely be there..."}
{"text":"I live close to this location so I used to eat here pretty regularly. I'm a big fan of their powerhouse bowl, the squash tacos, and their smoothies. But I've come to realize that their food is extremely overrated and expensive for what you're getting. They hardly put any actual veggies in anything - it's all alfalfa sprouts and cilantro. Last time I ordered the black bean and avocado wrap they didn't even put in the avocado. And I don't mean they were just stingy - they literally didn't put ANY in. I literally dissected it. I'm sure they just didn't think I would notice. And when I complained the waitress was very rude about it. I've found the people who work here are not nice at all, even at their other locations. I can put up with rudeness if the food is amazing, but there is honestly no point in coming here because the food isn't worth the poor service and expensive price tag."}
{"text":"healthy yummy in your tummy....from their juices, and sweet potato fries, to their soba or basmati bowls of culinary orchestra......the jerusalem, powerhouse, its all good..the prices are very reasonalble...and the decor is contemporary.... ..always a place worth diving into.."}
{"text":"I visited Fresh for the first time recently and yeah the place is jam packed (good sign by the way not a bad sign) and the staff and kinda anxious and short ( read busy and see comments on busyness) but the food here is so damn good for you and the menu is so extensive that I would forgive just about anything. It makes me so happy to see a restaurant feeding people with good healthy food. Healthy people make better decisions and do better things so in that sense Fresh are making the world a better place and I sure as hell hope they end up with stores all
over the world. I wish there was one near me I would never eat anywhere else"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. I surprised my friend by suggesting we go for vegan food. We got here and the place was packed, but the wait was not too long. The service was quite good and we were served our food promptly.

I ordered a tempeh bacon burger with fries. The food itself was good, but it was pretty pricey. I have no idea if it was competitive with other vegan places because I haven't visited a vegan only restaurant in years. But compared to other restaurants, paying ~13$ for a burger and ~7$ for fries, it was expensive. I'd come here again, but not choose the same choice lol.

I did envy my partner's tofu taco's! But I wish they had the mushroom burger available during brunch.

Price: 3/5
Service: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5
Price Point: 4/5"}
{"text":"QUINOA ONION RINGS (with chipotle mayo dip). That is what has me coming back again and again. Also, you leave the restaurant feeling healthy and satiated, never too full or too overwhelmed for the next meal.

At this particular location, it is always bustling. Tables are sandwiched very close to each other. Water refills are instantaneous.

The Baby Buddha bowl I've ordered many times. The bean sprouts and cilantro are piled ontop of soba noodles. The peanut sauce and crushed peanuts add the extra fulling dose of oil and texture.

Corporate discounts are only on takeout unfortunately (not dine in)."}
{"text":"I was here earlier this evening, and I love this place ~ it truly does not disappoint.  After a long hard day at work, followed by a gruesome Monday evening commute, I was totally famished upon arrival.  There was a line *sigh*.  No worries, as my DC was running a bit late anyway.

I ordered the sweet potato burrito option, and I'm glad I did.  I treated myself to a side of sweet potato fries with a thai peanut dip, and some sort of thornberry cider.  Everything was delish!  As usual, my eyes are bigger than my stomach, so I had half my burrito/wrap packed up to go.

My DC ordered the BBQ burger, which was delish, but she ended up not finishing it, not only b/c of the portion size, but also because it began to crumble a bit at the end.  She's a big fan of the baby beach bowl normally, but was inspired to try something different today.  

Since the tables are so close together, we had no choice but to make friends with fellow diners at the table next to us.  They looked thoroughly happy with their black bean burrito/wraps.  Weirdly they both ordered the same thing, but wanted to try a number of them (they'll be back).

We'll be back too."}
{"text":"This review has been a long time coming so kick back and take off your socks. 

When I first went here I did not know this was a vegetarian restaurant. Yep, I'm that asshole. I went here on a date and as I flipped through the menu I stuttered...

\"Hmmm there's a lot of s s s s salads in the appet t t t t izer section\" 

*surrounding tables start to look*

As I flip through the menu, I notice there are nothing but meatless entrees, my jaw begins to sag and my date mentions...

 \"Justin, there isn't any meat here... this is a vegetarian place\"  

\"WHAT?!\" 

* pin drop * 

I was super embarrassed. I managed to hold it together til the cheque came and scored a kiss on the cheek for my bravery. 

All in all not a bad night... 

ANYWHO - 

Since that experience I've always hesitated going back to the place as for some reason I always get anxious about eating there. The idea that I can only eat things that come from trees seems so limiting to me as a carnivore.... That being said, every time I'm forced to go back... whether it be the company I keep or the fact that I ate Korean BBQ for lunch and I need to balance out my diet.... I always come out with a pretty positive experience. 

Undeniably - The food is fresh, it's good for you, and its tasty.... it can be rare that you eat at a joint that gets at least two of the three right, so it's reFRESHing ----- har har to stumble upon a place that can do that, even though for me it isn't the dining of choice. 

Menu has a large selection of leaf and tree things and the service is really neat. 

The only downside is that I hate hippies.... with a passion.... I don't know what it is - the dreads, the mulch hanging out of their pocket, or listening to their stories about how they saved a juniper tree while picking peaches in British Colombia....all while eating a forkfull of leaves. Monsters. 

Space out the tables so I don't have green peace sitting next to me and you got a 5 star joint on your hands ! 

*NOTE Try the BBQ burger, close your eyes, and pretend your eating a hero burger... IT REALLY WORKS! - *"}
{"text":"I went to Fresh to meet my best friend, who is a bit of a militant vegetarian.  Fresh on Bloor seemed like the best option.  Conveniently located next to Spadina station, Fresh offers indoor seating and to go orders.  The restaurant is not accessible.  If you're into the whole raw and/or vegan and/or healthy style food, this place is worth trying.  

My only complaints about Fresh on Bloor are the following; I wish they offered smaller options.  I can't eat a lot but want to be able to try lots of different options.  Even when I order smaller meals, I still always have left overs, which drives me nuts.  My other complaint is that this place is really small and can get really loud.  I met my friend on a Thursday at 5:50pm and the place was slammed.  It didn't take long to get a table, but every inch of space was being used.  

I decided to go with the days special, an oyster mushroom po'boy.  It was so delicious!  It was panko crusted and came topped with cucumbers and vegan mayonnaise.  The mushrooms tasted very much like shrimp, which I really enjoyed.  I was unable to eat the sandwich without it falling apart, but I'm also uncoordinated.  Even without any sides, this sandwich was too big for me.  

I love Fresh and there food, but this specific location is not favourite."}
{"text":"For the price, the lcoation, the friendly helpful service, this place cannot be beat. Yes it's loud and busy... The soup, salad, nad cornbread with combo (with a giant clump of homemadey hummus) is a savory deal for $9.00.  Delicious drinks."}
{"text":"The food was okay at best. I wouldn't say bad but definitely not good. It's really expensive too. For two of us just it cost $50 tip inc. without ordering drinks or appetizers. I expect more."}
{"text":"Taste really good and quite popular restaurant, lots people during lunch time. I got energy baby size and sweet potato fries. Fries not that crispy but still ok. The hot sauce is really not my thing, next time will go with ketchup"}
{"text":"vegan heaven! highly recommend, this place has some delicious stuff!"}
{"text":"I find Fresh very expensive for what you get.  I have been about five times over the past three years.  This time I paid $14 for a bowl of rice with a small amount of other ingredients and a glass of water.  Tomatoes, cucumber, peanuts and tofu are not expensive ingredients and not even organic here.  The peanut sauce was about on par with President's Choice brand.  The seating is all packed together tightly and the restaurant is very noisy.  I get the allure of this place for vegans but the prices are really high for what you get/do not get which in my case was a whole lot of rice with not much else.  At this price point one can find much healthier and better quality."}
{"text":"My brother introduced me to this spot when it first opened. Since then I've gone back several times as I've always experienced prompt service, delicious food and a fun atmosphere. 

All their food is made with wholesome, natural ingredients which is a large reason I'll keep returning. Eating healthy and more organically has become such a focus and priority these days. That being said, it's nice knowing that here, I can eat without worrying about all those hidden chemicals or preservatives. Their food is also never frozen - awesome!!

I'd highly recommend anyone, especially those who are vegan or vegetarian to come here. The best part is that their quality dishes don't compromise prompt service. 

On this particular visit, I actually had the falafel tacos delivered on UberEATS - kind of risky to have this type of food delivered but YUM! The herbed falafel balls were to die for! I would definitely get them again... 
*On a side note, I also loved that they're to-go packaging is biodegradable. 

Let me be clear - the only reason I'm giving them a 4 star review is because the tacos were cold when I got them due to the long delivery time. Not their fault at all, but I definitely lost a bit of the flavour experience (they were a little soggy).

I will definitely be in soon to enjoy these while they're FRESH! ;)"}
{"text":"I used to eat here when I worked around the one on spadina. I think that's the place that ate the hole in my pocket... A little expensive but you get amazing service and some quality food. I'd recommend it if you're crazy vegan, but for healthy food there are other options too. Like, simply getting the balsamic vinaigrette salad at some small mom n' pop for usually $4ish less. 

It gets 4 stars from me for the service, the theme and the ambience. But, seriously, lower the price guys. Vegans are usually poor hippies, right?

The crazy smoothies and tempeh are another reason it gets 4 stars. That's a really nice touch. Ooh! And, AND! The little sauce bar near the door has some nice stuff, too. Try the peanut sauce."}
{"text":"love this place
I had the most delicious veggie burger but had to bring it home 
it was so big I couldn't finish it
I am not a vegan either"}
{"text":"SO GOOD!!! The service is wonderful. Spadina is the BEST!"}
{"text":"Been here more than 5 times. 

LOVE it. I come and love the entire menu. There's choices for everybody and it's so satisfying! 

Basically tried a bunch of their items and I gotta say my favourites are the burgers and wraps. 

Mushroom Onion Burger (11.50) -  very flavourful, taste just jumps out of your mouth! It's my absolute favourite out of everything, but everything out of the menu is so good that I come here and I gotta try something different each time! 

Fresh Platter (12)
\"sikil pak, cashew scallion paté, dukkah & olive oil, flax hummus, marinated olives, cucumber & heirloom 
grape tomatoes, w. Fred's Bread seeded red fife baguette\"

Description right outta the menu, don't know half of what I was eating but SO worth it. It's so pretty and a great sharing platter for two or more. Also unlimited bread if you like! 

Servers are very attentive and try their best to accommodate what always seems to be a full house.

Area for improvement: The table space is very limited unfortunately so don't be bringing your luggage here! Great for lunch spot though.

Honestly think place leaves you feeling 'fresh' and full. Definitely a regular on my list and will continue to be."}
{"text":"Best menu ever, their food is amazing!  The only concern is the restaruant is always packed whenever I stop by for takeout, but to be fair any restaruant with a superb menu is always full of people, anxious to eat their food."}
{"text":"I went there with a coworker last week. It's a busy and loud place in the evenings, but it still feels good enough to chat over a meal. Needs reservation for busy times. The food is delicious beyond any description. I tried their Goddess Bowl and felt so inspired that I bought one of the restaurant's cook books."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious! I love the yam fries, quinoa onion rings, tangled Thai salad, smoothies...everything. I always feel full and satisfied and bonus it's pretty healthy food, aside from the fried stuff I guess."}
{"text":"I am a little shocked to see so many negative reviews for Fresh. I do have to agree that the prices are pretty insane, but I just assumed that was the price of eating healthy. Though I am not vegetarian (let alone vegan) I have no problem finding something delicious to eat here. Their wraps and bowls are delicious and I feel like I have loads of energy when I am done. Apart from the high prices my only other complaint is the tight seating. If you're not waiting for a table then you are likely going to have to sit too close to someone else. Almost elbow-to-elbow.

Still, I enjoy eating here and have a crush on one or two of the waitresses. So dreamy..."}
{"text":"Yeah yeah yeah... Fresh is amazing! There's really nothing bad to be said about a place that focuses on relatively healthy food in a quick and timely manner (both eat-in and take away). Everything tastes great and makes you feel good about your life choices, even if only for a moment. 

The salads are delicious, the bowls are good too. Juices are amazing. Really my only problem with this place is the price. If only I had the time to construct a salad then I may not be paying $15 dollars for a nicely arranged bowl of veggies. 

Yes it's delicious and yes I do love the place BUT when given the time I usually would rather make it at home for half the price."}
{"text":"The food here was so good but the service was so shit. The waiter we had had so much attitude and she barely came to our table to wait on. She continuously sounded like she hated being there and I am not one to judge, maybe she had a shitty day? I don't know, but she was so rude. She was much nicer to the other tables surrounding us and she seemed to be annoyed that there were 5 of us... she should have just taken the day off. We felt so uncomfortable that we didn't get dessert and got it somewhere else. Anyways, at the end, we all tipped her 15% even though SHE WAS SHITTY... and just when we were leaving she said to us \"you guys are terrible\" .....beyond mind blown. I was so disappointed cause I LOVE fresh restaurants but this particular location was so bad! I could be wrong with just this one waiter but wow, other locations have been much more nicer!"}
{"text":"Have a buddy who's trying to eat super healthy and clean.  To the point of it making me ill cause he so damn good at what he does. 

I suggested lunch on a Sunday afternoon. He suggested this place. 

Pluses:
- pretty hip place to eat with a lot of good looking peeps. 
- nice fast paced environment with lots of things buzzing around.
- ordered the 'burger'. As a straight up meat eater it was...surprisingly tasty. Real fire was great. Taste was delicious. All in all a good job. 

Cons: 
- if you decide to eat here, expect a minimum 30 mins until your food arrives. It's not personal, and it's not cause there's a kitchen based on another planet. 
- it cause they take their time to ensure that your food is done properly. 

But - it is a long wait. I mean minimum 30. So that's why it's a 3 star rating and not a 4. 

Offer some free snacks or something."}
{"text":"I would give this 5 stars, if it wasn't slightly overpriced.

Soups are always excellent, and the bowls are consistently good. 

You've probably already heard about the sweet potatoes fries.

How to avoid a bad experience:

1) Sometimes crowds get annoyingly large. It can take quite a while to get your food at peak times, so if you're way down the list... just walk over to another restaurant on Bloor.

2) I suggest asking for extra sauce if you get a bowl. They rarely put enough into it, and the sauce is normally excellent.

3) The brown rice is just average, so I recommend upgrading to Soba noodles.

4) Don't go with more than about 4 people during peaks times or your wait for a table could be a lot longer"}
{"text":"Ah Fresh!! How I love thee!!
Even if it means packing the baby, haulin our suburban a$$e$ on the always busy Gardiner all the way down to Bloor, finding parking when I finally get to sink my teeth into your lovely Buddha bowl, its worth the pain!!
Yes, I have pretty much tried all of their other bowls, and all are divine. Including, the Baby Beach & my hubby's favorite Jerusalem. Oh, and the Quinoa crusted Onion Rings? yum!
And, don't forget to save room for their vegan cupcakes!!! Best I've ever had!!
Yes the lineups are atrocious but like the other reviewer said, come early (like 5:30PM early) on a weekend and you can avoid the lineups! We always do that, and on our way out around 7ish, we always see a lineup out the door."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place but it is not meant for people to dine alone! It's always busy and I always take out- no problem.  I always use my Toronto Veg Card for the 15% discount and at times I get dirty looks from the cashiers. This place is fast food. I always end up getting a holiday wrap and sweet potato fries because a lot of their food on their menu is over fried and doesn't settle well with my stomach. Their onion rings are delicious! I didn't like their soups at all. I  really like this place but they should really go easy on the oil!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've never had a bad meal at any of these restaurants. Their rice bowls are so filling and full of delicious vegetables. The tofu steaks that come on some of the bowls, along with the miso gravy they make, are incredible. The smoothies are worth trying too, especially the green ones - I always get one with an algae shot for extra B vitamins. My only complaint about this place is I wish they had more gluten free/celiac friendly food that wasn't rice bowls. And more quinoa and tempeh would also be amazing. But overall a great place and I've never had a bad experience. 

Accessibility: flat entrance, washroom on the same floor."}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with this place. They don't take reservations, and there are always line ups (weekdays, lunches, dinners, doesn't matter when). So, as much as I love the food there and the different food options, it's not cheap. Last time I was there, I gave my name at the front, she said she'd let me know when there was a table available and then left. After waiting for 20 minutes (everyone else was waiting for take-out - how can you tell? There's no sign? No clear way of knowing for a first timer) and seeing 4 tables finish and walk out (with no one else ahead of me to be seated), I finally went up to someone at the front and asked how much longer it was going to be (STAARVING) and the guy said \"Oh, sorry, I didn't realize that anyone was waiting\". My name was on the list. Really not my job to police if they're doing theirs. Having said that, my server was great, the food is great (not cheap though). Am not vegan/veggie, but don't do dairy and so the non-dairy food options are helpful here. But I'm not about to wait forever. Unfortunately the food is really really good. For these prices though, we should be getting organic produce. Not worth a really long wait though. Gah!"}
{"text":"Fresh is good, I've been here over 20 times because it's right next to my house and so convenient to go to especially in the winter when I'm lazy.
The food is all good, but it's not amazing, and most of the salads can be made at home. 
Everything is vegan but it's not all healthy- once you actually look at what's in the ingredients (and a lot of things are fried!). 

BUT, they have two things on the menu that are amazing:
1. carrot cake
2. sweet potato fries w/garlic sauce. 

Also, the service is usually friendly and quick."}
{"text":"This place is always packed, so be prepared to wait for a table. The best thing on the menu is the barbecue burger, which comes topped with delicious quinoa onion rings. Avoid the pancakes and tofu scramble at all costs. The tofu scramble is just gross and the pancakes are way too HEAVY. It's like eating a dense muffin."}
{"text":"Cozy lunch spot which was very busy when we came but had a great buzz. It is setup like a diner and they seat you as you walk in 

I had the Chipotle Bacon Burger and my wife had the Squash Tacos. Both of them had great texture and flavours. This will be one of our go to spots from now on!"}
{"text":"I dine at Fresh very often, and last night was very disappointing. 
The server really didnt care much about our table. She just took order, and that was it. She didnt bother asking if the food was good or if we needed anything else. 
The salads we had were very plain, We couldn't taste any dressing.

However, the quinoa onion rings were amazing- My all time favourite. 
I gave 3 stars for the onion rings, minus 2 stars for the salads and the service."}
{"text":"Fresh has been kind of all over the place for me. I've eaten here a lot but every time my view changes. This location has been my favourite out of all the ones I've been too but it's still not good. 

The atmosphere is interesting. Mirrors on walls, chandlers, retro (really uncomfortable) chairs, wild colours. Not really my cup of tea but minus the chairs it's ok. It's clean, spacious, bright. 2.5/5   

The services is all over the damn the map. I've had two good servers & the rest have been awful. Either really cold & standoffish, not paying attention to customer need. They all just stand around and chat it seems like. I don't know I feel like I'm in a fancy collage cafeteria sometimes. One time we came here in a Saturday around 2:40 to get the breakfast menu option. When I came in I told them we need a gluten free menu, the girl doesn't listen, sets us without it & leaves. A couple minutes later another server comes & asks us what we want to orders. We tell her we are still waiting on the proper menus to arrive. She brings them over & then no one come back for another 10-12 minutes. We have long before that put down the menus, it was not busy at all. I have no idea why no one came over. Once someone finally came over we tried to order the tacos but they didn't have have green wraps in stock so we then asked to order the brunch menu. We then got told it was after 3pm so we couldn't order from it.... It was 3:02 & they didn't have the ingredients in stock for are first choose plus it took them forever to serve us & it wasn't even busy. What the heck?!

The food I can only really judge on the Gluten free menu & to be honest it's not that good. I've liked there sauces & brunch menu but others then that it's really just basic IMO. Nothing to rave about. I will come for the brunch but that's about it. 

Overall I would only say come to Fresh for the brunch menu on the weekends."}
{"text":"I've probably been here about 10 times and it never disappoints.  The menu features a huge selection of vegetarian food, including (but not limited to) noodle/rice bowls, wraps, burgers, salads, and smoothies.  Everything is in the $8-$16 range, with the pricier items large enough to take leftovers home.

I am not even a vegetarian, and I always find it easy to find something new and exciting to try.  I've had a variety of items here, but I think the stand out dishes are really the bowls.  My favorite is the Buddha Bowl on soba noodles, which features thai peanut sauce, marinated tofu cubes, tomato, cilantro, cucumber, bean sprouts, chopped peanuts, herbs and spices. Mmm so good and so satisfying.  

Sometimes I feel like vegetarian food doesn't fill me up - but not here!  The best part about this place is no matter how stuffed I am, I never feel guilty about what I've just eaten because it's all (relatively) healthy. 

My only complaint is that the tables in here are really close together - at busy times it can feel like you're sitting in your neighbours lap.  So if cozying up doesn't suit you, avoid prime lunch and dinner times."}
{"text":"Disappointing ! I usually order the Jerusalem bowl from Fresh. It had no tahini and lacked enough vegetables and humus. The rice was noticeably stale. I don't recommend this restaurant and it used to be my go to place to eat."}
{"text":"As vegetarians visiting from the United States, we were bowled over by this healthy eatery. Everything is delicious and well-prepared, including the juices. Amazing kale slaw, and anything with miso gravy is going to be a hit. The avocado-chipotle dipping sauce is packed with tastebud-pleasing flavor. Lucky people of Toronto, consider yourself fortunate for this outstanding lunch spot."}
{"text":"As a card carrying omnivore, I was floored by how delicious this food was.  The flavors are out of this world and everything tastes so fresh (hence the name!).  I did not miss meat at all.  If I lived closer I would get take out from here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"One of MY FAVOURITE places to eat downtown! It gets really crowded and tight in the tiny restaurant but its worth it since the food is amazing! I always get one of their fresh bowls which I never finish since the portions are really big. The bowls are around $15 and $11 for the Baby bowls [$2 extra for Soba noodles] . Highly recommend their Buddha bowl and Energizer bowl.
I also love their Mushroom onion burgers but are a bit pricy at $11.
The only complaint I have is that they changed their homemade hot sauce which I used to love."}
{"text":"A room full of unhip people who believe that their proximity to tattooed waiters will somehow make them cooler.

Surprisingly, it works.

I picture the kitchen of this place as having three giant buckets.   One full of lettuce.  One full of soybeans.  And one full of a sunflower seed/ quinoa combination.    In the middle of the room there's like a giant blender, some noodles and a spray gun.   

Surprisingly, it works.

It's one of the only vegetable-based restaurants that can consistently attract carnivores as repeat customers.   That in itself speaks to both the awesome branding and consistent food quality of this (insert chick pea here).

You don't want to like it, because it's yuppies and vegetables.  

But you do, because it's great."}
{"text":"Pros: 

1) The food is absolutely amazing. 
2) The food is always fresh and lives up to its expectations. 

Cons: 

1) I frequent this restaurant and often feel rushed. We are in and out in less than 1, apps included. 

2) The tables are so close together, when one other guest leaves their butt is in your food. Yes that close!I always ask for a booth to avoid this ackward mess.

3) The payment machine has 3 options to tip 18, 20, 22% which is so overconfident.

This is not a place to chill and relax. This is clearly a business, eat, tip big, and get the F*k out."}
{"text":"Much better than I was expecting, and much more filling than I was expecting. As with all hip vegetarian places, a little overpriced.

I came with a friend today and we split the guac-bean dosas, and the apple pie smoothie. No complaints. Texture and flavours were complex and a pleasant surprise!

I had the thai burger. I commend them on their veggie patties--made with nuts, soy, and other good veggie friendly things. You can even ask for the burger on lettuce instead of the bun, ridding the meal of the last vestiges of anything remotely unhealthy. My only complaint is that the peanut sauce was overwhelming and too thick in copious amounts. It drowned out the taste of the rest of the meal!

All in all, I would recommend to veggie friends for nice occasions. Not really somewhere I would see myself returning to regularly, but as the three star rating says, it's a-ok (:"}
{"text":"So I'm going to start this off right away by saying that I'm not a vegetarian, have never been a vegetarian, and am actually quite fond of meat. 

However, we had some vegetarian visitors come to town, so we decided to hit up Fresh. It's a pretty small space, and is usually jam packed when I walk past. The menu is filled with a wide array of salads, wraps, and bowls of veggies over rice or noodles.

My dinner here definitely forced me to become one with my inner carnivore, and come to the realization that I really don't care for things like jicama, quinoa or alfalfa. I ended up ordering the dosas from the appetizer menu. 

The dosas tasted more like vegetarian enchiladas than dosas. The crepe tasted exactly like a corn tortilla, and it was stuffed with a chickpea filling. Unfortunately the entire ensemble was pretty bland, so I ended up slathering it with hot sauce.

Portions are huge - the salads could easily feed two, and the burgers are large and come with heaps of sweet potato fries. The corn bread looked really good - dense, grilled slabs of cornmeal. The vegan chipotle mayo tasted way more like yogurt than anything mayo or chipotle, but it's definitely interesting to try.

They have a selection of wines and beers, as well as a large selection of smoothies. They have desserts too, but they are on the pricey side. The staff here all have very whimsical mustaches gelled and curled to fashionable heights, and were very calm and polite despite having to handle such a crowded restaurant."}
{"text":"Walked in at 1230pm on a Saturday and was seated immediately by a friendly hostess. The restaurant was packed but luckily there was an open table, despite it being situated in very close proximity to the neighbouring table. I started with a 16oz \"all greens\" juice which was delicious and tart and very well priced at $8 for its size. My friend and I each ordered the baby size \"green goddess bowl\" with basmati rice (mine with grilled tofu steaks, hers with crispy tofu cubes), and an order of onion rings with the chipotle mayo dipping sauce. The bowls were flavourful, the pickled ginger gave it a nice extra kick. The onion rings were OUT OF THIS WORLD, by far the best onion rings I have ever had. If you walk out of this establishment without trying them, you are making a huge mistake!!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me.  I did not like the experience I had here at all.  It was quite busy when we went because it was around dinner time.  
We're not vegetarians, but we all kept an open mind.  The friend that recommended the place said she really liked the texture of the rice.  When we finally got a seat, the server said they ran out of rice!  What kind of restaurant runs out of rice when it's one of their main ingredients?!  
I ordered one of their fresh bowls and they told me that they also ran out of avocados!  So, I said fine, I will just replace it with some other ingredient, but the server said that wasn't an option unless I wanted to pay more for the extra ingredient.  She said that I can pick to have more of an ingredient that was already in the fresh bowl.  That is BS because it's not my fault your restaurant ran out of ingredients!
I think I ordered the beach fresh bowl and it was just drenched in olive oil.  The only reason why I'm giving this rating a 2 star and not 1 is because the sweet potato fries were good and one of my friends ordered one of their drinks, which was pretty good too.
The meal was expensive and I wasn't even full.  I'm a pretty lenient rater too.  The only thing I MIGHT come back for at Fresh is their drinks - which looks good, but is too pricey."}
{"text":"So I'll admit that I have sticker shock for food in Toronto. Still, even in Toronto I can't believe that a burrito and a bowl of rice with peanut sauce should have cost 30 bucks. Was the food good? Eh, it was ok. The burrito was far better than the Buddha bowl, but neither was worth the price. Next time I'd go for the mediocre thai food down the street that was better and cost about the same. Very crowded as well during the lunch rush..."}
{"text":"I like this place, I like this place quite a bit actually. Back when I had a job, I would spend a considerable amount of time visiting this place, because to me, their stuff, while not all, if even a quarter, is organic, is pretty tasty and when given myself enough time before work, I could order it and be pleased with the outcome.

I am sorry to hear about the bad experiences, people have had here. Apart from the occasional, waiting an additional 10-15 minutes, on an already 20 minute wait order, all my experiences have been reasonably great and has kept me returning.

I have gone here a few times within the past three weeks that has me altering this review.... first off I ordered a 16 oz green juice, the detoxifier I think it was, and I asked them to put it in my glass jar, which has the measurements on the side! They can only administer one discount. Either it be one of using your own glass or container, or one applied from the live green card, both are 15%, I believe. And for anyone reading this that does not have a livegreen card. I recommend you get one by searching, \"Toronto, livegreen card\" in google and find the correct connecting site. :) There are not many places that use it, but fresh is one that is good to have it for.

Anyways back on to this drink, so I got it in my take away jar and it was to be part of my lunch for the day. I have to travel to Leisliville for work, there are no freshes in that area, unfortunately. And it wasn't until I had my lunch that I noticed the drink was not even 16 oz of liquid. I have the measurements to prove it. I'm not one for leaving bad reviews. I believe that it is important to give praise, where praise is due and to offer improvements or constructive criticism where that is needed as well, here is one such case. I believe it is more of a technicality anyway... as it is the foam they count as well, as a part of their drink, but to me this seems incongruent with the amount one pays for the beverages at fresh. Understandably so, the cost of many things has gone up, yet again, however this is something that I feel needs to be shared! So, ensure on your next drink order from fresh that it is the full amount!

Additionally, I also ordered on another day, the transformer salad. This is one of their pricier salads, sitting at 16 bucks, yet it is totally worth it. There is plenty of protein packed in there. They recently changed their menu again and this is a salad to be had."}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian or vegan in Toronto this place is like McDonald's to you. They have multiple locations, and they serve up burgers, wraps, soups, bowls, shakes... and you can get the food to go.

Years ago I was vegetarian, and I had friends who were too. So I found myself here a bunch of times. The food here is not bad, but purely based on taste you could find much tastier vegetarian food. I wished they would do curries or something. (Although their food is healthier than a curry). Also from what I've seen of the bowls they are more rice than anything else. So I've always steered clear of the bowls, but I would recommend the burger with the quinoa onion ring.

Unless you are a vegetarian/vegan/watching your health... I don't see the point of going here. Although the next time my vegetarian friend from Michigan is in town I'm sure I'll be by."}
{"text":"It is a vegan restaurant, that's awesome! 
Decent food. The cold press juices are delicious but expensive for 12$. I have tried their buddha bowl, Thai burger, mushroom onion burger , brownie, squash soup, lentil soup, fries , salads and a lot more.I find everything okay, nothing exceptional. 
If you are vegan it is a good option otherwise I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I love Fresh for the food, but the service is so bad I almost regret going every time (but clearly I keep returning - because of the delicious food!!)

My go-to orders are the clubhouse wrap and the Buddha bowl, both of which are extremely flavourful and filling. I've recently noticed that the side salad option that comes with the wrap has been eliminated, which is a shame as the plating just looks sad with two halves of a wrap (it's really missing something else...like the side salad!) The Buddha bowl has marinated tofu, so many different veggie toppings, and the most tasty peanut sauce. A little on the pricy side, but it's definitely worth it. Fresh also has one of the best hot sauces I've ever tasted, and I've been guilty of loading it liberally on to my food - which really makes it 10000% even more yummy. 

The downside is the seating and staff. The tables are so close together that sometimes it's difficult to get out, and when you try to your butt is basically in your neighbour's face. The staff is rude and does not care about you, which is a shame as the food is so great the restaurant really deserves 5 stars, but the service knocks it down to a 3. What's worse is that the machine has 3 options to tip (18, 20, or 22 percent), which is extremely undeserved. 

Tl;dr
Fresh is delicious and worth every penny, but be warned of the terrible service and cramped dining area."}
{"text":"My vegetarian relatives introduced me and my friend to this place when we were staying in Toronto. Though it was my first time there, I was really pleased with their picnic burger, one of the best, most flavorful veggie burgers I've ever had and the veggie patty appeared to be made in-house. I also chose the power cookie shake out of their expansive drink menu and was not let down by it! It had all my smoothie favorites like maca powder, raw cacao, dates, and hemp, and was very filling. Our favorite was definitely the vegan poutine which I didn't think was vegan until I noticed how there was no gross feeling that I would normally get after eating regular poutine. My friend is in love with this place now and she's an avid meat eater so that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"Food is all right but I don't think I would come back because the atmosphere is completely non-conducive to any sort of productive conversation.

My friend and I dropped by on a Wednesday evening and it wasn't that packed initially but it got pretty busy soon (which probably explains the slow service - we waited 30 mins for our food).

I ordered the Tangled Thai (spiralized carrots, beets + peanut sauce, cilantro, whole peanuts, dried goji berries, raisins, diced cucumbers) while my friend ordered the Clubhouse Wrap (tofu steak, tempeh bacon, veggies, garlic mayo).

The price was a bit hefty for a small bowl ($13) and normally I can justify spending this much for quality food but this was not the case - my dish was nothing exceptional. My friend's wrap on the other hand was tasty - I sampled some of his tofu steak and I liked it, so maybe I should've gone with that instead?

It's nice inside but music is LOUD. It was difficult to talk to my friend because we had to constantly repeat ourselves. 

I would give this place 2 stars but +1 star for friendly waitresses."}
{"text":"Place gets ridiculously busy every night, I'd go before 6pm to avoid a wait.

Service is attentive and fairly quick despite how busy it is, you really have to give them props for that.

The food is generally pretty good but it can be hard for someone who loves meat (like me) to adapt to the taste - many of the items on their menu taste weird to me for some reason (and I refuse to order one of their burgers, because there's no way in hell it can match up to a well-made beef burger e.g. Holy Chuck). Basically, you have to try a bunch of things to see what you like.

I usually go for the beach bowl with goat cheese on rice. Also, these guys make really really good fries (the Yukon gold ones, not the sweet potato). Every smoothie that I've tried here was great.

Overall, no complaints. Hard for me to find a vegetarian restaurant that I like, and I like this one."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of this place.

Up until a few days ago when my salad came out looking like its 2 days old. The it had little brown/black spores on it and didn't take fresh all at. Not crunchy but stale. Same with the tofu squares. I know it's been out because I ALWAYS order the Thai Tamgled salad. So to receive something that looked revolting... Fresh isn't exactly fresh as I thought. I'll probably steer away from this location for a while."}
{"text":"No. Just no. The food is fine, if not getting less and less inspired as they become more established.. But the staff is what did it for me. After forgetting my order, the waitress had the nerve to just bark at me \"We're busy\" instead of apologizing. I waited for a LONG time to get barked at. And, um, they weren't busy. There were several empty tables. I really can't get over the attitude that the server gave me. She spoke to me like I was a small child. I'm not a vegetarian, but I enjoyed Fresh because their food, though not the best thing ever, felt good to consume. Bye Fresh."}
{"text":"Went to the Fresh by Spadina station and had the All Star Salad ($13) it had 
quinoa & adzuki bean tabouleh on shredded raw kale with goji berries, Toasted Mixed Nuts, parsley, cilantro, sunflower sprouts, grilled sweet potato & tofu steaks which I paired with the house dressing (vinaigrette with flax oil,
apple cider vinegar and hints of garlic, tamari & mustard). It was PERFECTO!

Loved how filling and tasty this plate was, I was so hungry I cleaned the plate.
Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I live just up the street from this place. I've eaten here a few times and would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I was walking up Bloor again trying to find something healthy in the endless line of fast and fried food.  I came across this place (which I had evidently walked past a dozen times) and peeked at the menu and saw that they had a variety of salads and that was what I was in the mood for.  

I later discovered that this is a vegetarian restaurant.  Well, I'm not a vegetarian.  If fact less than two weeks ago I was chowing down on all sorts of creatures from scorpions and silkworms to cats and horse in China.  But I like vegetables too.  I like fruits a lot.  Nuts and beans also make up significant portions of my diet.  This place was great for me.  I had a salad with cornbread and a bowl of soup.  The salad was plain and largely shredded carrots but achieved it's purpose...and I agree with the other commenter that they don't do anything for presentation of the food.  The cornbread was okay...I didn't eat the second piece.  The West African lentil soup with sweet potato was delicious.  I would get that again.  And the juice/smoothie menu looks amazing.

The decor was great.  I came alone (as usual) and sat in a minibooth so I wasn't cramped at all, but looking around I could see how people are pretty much placed up next to each other in order to cram as many people into that space rather than create a nice environment.  That could spoil a meal and be real annoying...depending on who sat next to you.  Didn't bother me this time, but I might have to update the rating if it happens.

I'll be back, if nothing else to get a smoothie to go.  If you want to eat healthy, then, vegetarian or not, this is possibly the only place in this area where you can eat."}
{"text":"There is a reason that I am here 2-3 times/ week.  I am a vegan, but this is one place that I know I can take my carnivorous friends because the food is so tasty, its hard to notice that there is no meat on your plate.  The flavours are so fresh and are combined in ways that are interesting to the palate.  I am a big fan of the powerhouse bowl, the beach bowl and the buddha bowl- all different, all delightful.  Be sure to ask for some hot sauce - it has a unique flavour and makes the food that much better.  

Fresh on Bloor is always busy, and for good reason.  The food is healthy, the flavours are fresh, and the service is generally great.  They are quick to acknowledge any mistakes that have been made, and correct them without hassles (and even when there are mistakes, the food is still superb).  I wish there was a Fresh in my neighbourhood - I would never need to use my kitchen :)"}
{"text":"This is my spot in Toronto. The phyto salad is epic and is almost too pretty to eat. I love the date almond smoothie, I'd cry if they took it off the menu. The poutine is killer, the onion rings are great.
I adore all the different soups that they have, creative and so delicious"}
{"text":"Wholesome food... Overall a good place..

One major issue I have is that they don't post up nutritional information (and explain it away on their website in a sort of patronizing dismissive way)."}
{"text":"So, I got the worst food poisoning in my adult life at this location. It was wretched and I basically thought I was dying. IT WAS THAT BAD. I had to take TIME OFF WORK to recuperate. I am 99.9% sure it was here, as a friend who ordered a green juice that same day became absurdly sick as well. But that's the gamble you take when you eat raw or raw vegan at establishments that apparently are way lax on their food safety standards. Ugh ugh ugh.

The sad part of all of this was that I was a huge fan of Fresh for YEARS. I went to all the locations in Toronto and devoured the Buddha Bowl like a god damned HAMBEAST really often. It was probably my most favourite take out meal. But JAYSUS, all those wonderful glittery moments of me with my Buddha Bowl were washed away as a demonic force from vegan hell began to over take my insides and made me regret ever being born.

I went back to air my grievances and the manager was apologetic and a good listener. She heard me out and offered a voucher for like...a smoothie or another meal? I didn't even bother asking for a refund because I didn't want anything to do with them; I was just hoping that my experience would make them tighten their food handling standards.

GOODBYE FRESH. WE HAD GOOD TIMES, BUT YOU BETRAYED ME."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Not stellar, but decent. If you go, you must get the sweet potato fries with miso gravy, are delicious. I don't go there for anything else though some of my friends like those bowls. Green goddess and dragon bowls are the hits among my people."}
{"text":"I am a repeat visitor to Fresh (even though I am not vegetarian). My friends and I go to Fresh so often because of the excellent food. Top quality  fresh ingredients are prepared in a way that unleashes all of their flavour. I never leave hungry or unsatisfied in any way. Some would say it is on the pricey side, and I would agree that it is not cheap, but to me every dollar is accounted for by the service and and quality of the food. 

The reason I would not give Fresh a five star review is about the set-up of the restaurant. Every Fresh I've been to has been in a pretty small building and in an attempt to fill the restaurant to it's full capacity, tables have pretty narrow spaces between them. I have on occasion (especially if I come in alone and they try to \"make a spot for me\") have ended up uncomfortably close to a stranger."}
{"text":"This place should be called:
Not-So-Fresh.

If you want food poisoning and to be surrounded by food snobs, please come here.

There are fruit flies everywhere, the service was terrible and 15 minutes after eating I immediately threw up my entire dinner at the Starbucks down the road.

The menu was okay but everything tasted bland like it was served as a side dish rather than a main course.

This was my first experience trying vegan food and I'm sad to say this location is the pits. I've never been so ill from eating a meal in all my life. Avoid the tofu."}
{"text":"The food is great, whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not. Service is sort of lackluster."}
{"text":"This vegetarian restaurant... is simply awesome. But VERY noisy... so bring ear plugs. 

My favorite, Buddha (why are you looking at my picture like that?), is a flavor explosion in your mouth. Not sure if it's curry or peanut butter sauce but whatever it is, it WORKS! It's a protein meets carb dish. Tofu, rice, nuts and sprouts. It's plenty so you'll feel abundantly buddhaish. 

My next favorite is the corn bread + salad + soup combo. These guys know what a good soup is. *Campbell, listen*. 

If you don't trust me like you don't trust your boyfriend, ask your server to taste it before ordering. Don't you wish you can try out a boyfriend first before committing? If only boyfriends are soups... 

Now let's talk about noise level. Oh boy, this place is noisy. You can't exchange I love yous here ... you won't hear each other. Learn to be animated if you want to keep a good conversation inside Fresh On Bloor.

So is Fresh refreshing (ahem)? Yes. Will I come back? Definitely? 

Will I bring ear plugs? Of course! Enjoy the noise and food."}
{"text":"This review was supposed to be funny. Now it seems less so. On the eve of the G20 summit in Toronto , I wrote from my lonely cubicle, perched high above Bay Street, in the ghost town that used to be Toronto. 

Fresh by Juice for Life is part of a mini-chain that stretches down Queen Street and out towards Crawford St . I wait for a table along with the hipster femme crowd. Amidst the pin-up girl tattoos, cut off Dickies pants and razored haircuts, I am the picture of corporate conformity, the love-child of Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, if only they'd tapped toes in an Minnesota airport restroom. I yearn for gray flannel, a power tie, and a plate of freedom fries. I wanna privatize something. Bad.

We are seated at a booth, joined by a bottle of lemon-water. It is refilled throughout our visit by staff who don't know much about the menu beyond the blackboard specials, but who are very, very happy to be there. We order, and shortly a pair of fruit smoothies appear. The Negril Beach combo of mango, banana and coconut milk almost makes one believe that a pina colada could be healthy, while the Cherry Blossom (Cherry, apple, raspberry and banana) packs a deep, tart punch, although less-pulverized cherry flesh gives it an oddly meaty texture.

Appetizers and mains arrive swiftly. 

Dosas are traditional Indian crepes, folded over a variety of fillings. Creamy avocado surrounds inconsistently-cooked white beans. Chipotle is promised but does not deliver. Perfunctory tomato, cucumber and cilantro add crunch, and the mess is lost under enough hemp seeds to yield questionable drug-test results. Flavours are muted, and the dish is an off-putting combination of temperatures, between the hot pancake, surprisingly cool filling, and ice cold veggies. The curried chickpea version fares better; sweet and creamy, and rich with cumin. House-made hot sauce livens most dishes considerably.

 A side order of sweet potato fries comes golden brown, but limp.

Fresh bowls stand in for mains. They are salad, starch and veggie protein in one. I'm told that some vegetarians pursue the lifestyle for it's health benefits. I can only hope that this group bears portion control in mind, for the bowls are huge. Smaller, \"baby bowls\" are available for those who are physically, as well as environmentally conscious. 

The Energy bowl contains more curried chick pea stew, alongside pleasantly chewy marinated tofu cubes, veggies, sprouts and tahini. The Buddha bowl switches out the stew for a very sweet/salty peanut sauce. The Dragon bowl is a further variation on the theme, only with miso gravy, tomato and zucchini. All are piled on top of a heap of brown basmati rice or soba noodles. For occasional vegetarians, or those looking to atone for a weekend's caloric debauchery, the bowls are a riot of color and texture. Nods to Indian, or Mexican, or Japanese ingredients are lost to the overwhelming \"brown\" flavours that dominate sauces and stews.

One leaves Fresh feeling good about oneself; as if food were charity. However, for $30 a head with no animal protein, booze, coffee, or dessert, one wonders if charity couldn't begin at home."}
{"text":"I hate how vegetarian spots gets a bad rep... you know the ones that have tough dry tofu served by hipsters who don't care about you or your experience.    Not that Fresh on Bloor is flavourless or actively tries to be that way but the service here is definitely is on the 'don't care about you' part.  

The space here is much bigger than the Spadina spot with less crowding.   BUT If you're seated by the walls, it's possible to be seating on another table's lap... and that's not an exaggeration.  Similar to the Spadina spot, there was a HUGE wait on a Sunday lunch time.  Sad thing is that they could have easily reduced it by actually paying attention to the tables.  So many times we could have easily ordered in the first 10 minutes but we didnt get anyone's attention until 25 minutes later.  We could have left 10 minutes earlier as well... but trying to flag someone done to get our cheques... good luck.  

Buffalo Cauliflower - A great starter as it's crunchy with a bit of heat and vinegar to keep it interesting.  I found this version a bit more heavily breaded and more oilier than the Spadina one.  It's close to the Spadina version but I would say the Bloor one was just not as good.  Still a solid app and would probably order it from another spot.  3.5/5

All star salad - I tried a new one and I think the falafel salad is definitely the better tasting one.  I'm not saying this one was lacklustre but I felt half the bowl was just plain quinoa which is good from a protein perspective.  But from a taste perspective, I would have liked more sweet potato or tomatoes... something!  I felt the original dressing was probably too light in flavour as well.  I hit the vegetable with a bit of the hot sauce and it perked up the vegetables.  Another thing, it is a generous bowl... I can easily make 2 meals out of it and it also costs $16 before tax and tip.  Affordable for a single meal?  Possibly not.  3.5/5

Black Bean Burrito - A Mexican take on their wraps, this one was filled with black bean, avocado, cilantro, sprouts, tomato, lettuce, onions, cucumber, and Mexican hot sauce.  It also has a gooey sauce which they call 'fresh cheese'.  Overall, this was a big portion.  Definitely meal size and the burrito easily was 4 inches across.  From a price perspective, it was a decent value.. you could make it 2 smaller meals if you wanted.  As for flavour and texture, the addition of the hot sauce made it more than just a salad in a wrap.  I felt this was a lot of soft mushier parts... I would have appreciated a good crunch to shake it up.  3.5/5

Swoosh power shakes - This is one expensive shake.. $8.50 for a medium.  When it arrived to the table, it was more generous than I anticipated and with the ingredients of Peanut butter, dark cocoa, maple syrup, banana, cinnamon, and almond milk, I was anticipating a really thick shake.  It definitely was and it was potently sweet as well.  You can really taste the chalkiness of the dark cocoa and it almost felt like it had a big scoop of protein powder.  The cinnamon and banana added to the sweetness of the maple syrup.  Overall, not bad... $8.50 though? not sure.  3.5/5

I think the service unfortunately made the whole experience less than stellar.  The staff pretty much avoided acknowledging you even if you did grab their eye contact several times.  I'm not sure how this place keeps super packed with that and the slow service PLUS it's not cheap.  Sure, it's generous portions but for most people, $19 salad with tax and tip is more than most people can afford."}
{"text":"Fresh is one of the healthiest  joints I've been too. Always a good place if you want a healthier alternative. Burgers, rice bowls, burritos, juices. You almost can't go wrong with whatever it is that you pick to eat. 
Waiters are also friendly and fast. Beware as it's almost busy everyday especially close to lunch and dinnertime. Good that they have several locations. 
I try something different everytime  here.  As a coffee fanatic,  this is one of the best places that makes gojicino."}
{"text":"My friend and I finished our exams today, and really wanted to eat at a vibrant eatery downtown. Fresh was perfect, the atmosphere was busy, but not too busy. The tables were super close and you could hear the conversations going on beside your table, but it was tolerable. The only reason I rated it a 4 is because there was a small hair in my tikka masala when it came out, but the server was really understanding. She offered me a free juice/smoothie, and to replace my meal with another. The mini bowl (smaller sized one) was a good amount for lunch, but I'd recommend the larger one for a dinner or if you like to eat larger portions. I also ordered the dragon fries to share, and it tasted like a superfood poutine (I loved it). I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys healthy cuisine, or is a vegan/vegetarian!"}
{"text":"I somehow get stuck going to this place every time a certain friend visits from out of town. Neither of us are vegetarian, but for some reason she loves it.

The place is crowded - tables are pushed together too closely on one side of the restaurant, making for awkward conversing since people at the next table are sitting 8 inches away from you. 

The food is hit and miss. The portions suck, some of the \"baby\" bowls cost $10-$12 bucks and come with half a cup of noodles or rice with some beansprouts mixed in and a couple chunks of tofu and sauce. And $8 protein shakes...Really? Meh....

I always stick to the Mediterranean platter which is falafel, hummus, pita, olives, tzatziki and some cucumber and tomato slices for $8. Much better deal. It tastes good. Their sweet potato fries are delicious too.  

As an added annoyance, it's always completely busy. Even Monday evening, we had to wait 25 minutes for a table. The food takes ages to come out too. The kitchen is busy cooking up a zillion take-out orders before getting to the in-house diners.

I can handle vegetarian food but I'm glad I eat meat and don't need to depend on this place as one of my only dining-out options. 

2.5 stars"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE
My go-to meals are the BBQ burger, or holiday wrap. The drinks are great. Take out is fast, and I always leave feeling full and satisfied.

If you want to indulge, try the quinoi battered onion rings"}
{"text":"Trendy spot, trendy food, but nothing special here, and when veggie food is more expensive than meaty food and the service is poor (much too slow!! 30 minutes to get a salad and a bowl of soup!?? really?!), there is nothing to commend... move one of the 6 persons from the drink bar in the kitchen to help the 3 \"cooks\" to prepare items faster!"}
{"text":"Fresh was the first fully vegetarian restaurant I ever ate at. It was odd being able to choose anything on the menu. I've been coming here for several years now, and strangely enough, I generally always order the same thing despite having so much choice. 
My go to meal at Fresh is the Deluxe Burger with Yukon Gold Fries, usually with a Thornbury Cider.  It's delicious and filling, and I must say after eating there I crave the burger for days. 
Last time I was there I decided to finally change it up a bit and ordered the Grilled Vegetable & Pesto Burrito, partially because I really wanted to have the Carrot Cake and thought a wrap wouldn't fill me up as much as the burger. Much to my surprise (and delight) the Burrito was huge. My only complaint about it is that there was a little too much zucchini and a little less of the other veggies. Very flavourful. 
My least favourite things about Fresh are the wait times (recently waited over an hour on a Thursday for a party of three), the cramped seating at many of the tables, and not being able to have a proper conversation because of how noisy it is. 
I've had a few less than perfect experiences with the wait staff as well (mainly being rushed to order  -- and then ignored for a while when we need more time), but for the most part the service is good, and despite it always being busy I rarely have to wait long for my food after ordering. 
The food is decently priced as the portions are generous. 
Fresh is a great restaurant if you want a filling vegetarian or vegan meal and are willing to wait a while for a table. Wait times seem to be the most reasonable for a group of two."}
{"text":"I love the food fresh has. The dragon fries especially are my favourite and I always get it delivered or i pick it up. However I went in with my friends and sat down for a light meal and I had never experienced such depressing service. The waitress seemed like she had lost all hope in life and as soon as she came over to our table it felt like a dark cloud loomed over us. I then ate at another fresh location and our waitress was amazing. The only reason I'm not giving this location 1 star is because the food is actually very good."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! If you're trying to eat healthy, this is the place for you. They offer big servings of guilt free food and also offer many fruit smoothies. The restaurant is usually full and cramped, you will often have to wait for a table, but it's worth the wait."}

I look forward to trying some of the MANY other options soon!!"}
{"text":"I've noticed within my group of friends, and even on Yelp that you either love Fresh, or you hate it. I guess you're allowed to like it, but generally people seem to feel pretty strongly about this place.

Personally, I don't mind it. Sometimes when you're going out to dinner with someone, you just don't want to eat crap for once, and getting a salad from Fresh is a great alternative to eating a giant bowl of pad thai. I've tried their other dishes and I like them -- the menu is interesting and delicious, and I personally love to stuff my face with leaves.

I love the squishy sweet potato fries, partially because I've always preferred the mushy fries to the crispy ones, and partially because I think sweet potatoes can do no wrong. Miso gravy is a welcome addition to the plate. All their salads are huge, filled with ingredients that help fill you up and keep you healthy. You get to choose your own dressing-- I love the wasabi dill.

As for the physical properties of the restaurant, this location is definitely too small, especially if you have a big bag. I think I hit about four people on the way to my seat last time I was here."}
{"text":"I love going here for casual dining. I've been here a lot and every time the servers are always really friendly. Plus I always feel super healthy after eating here :) My favourite dishes are the beach bowl (get rice with goat cheese) and the barbecue burgers. Great place for a veggie fix, and every meat lover I've ever taken has loved it. The wait is always long (usually 20 minutes), but that's not really surprising given it's location. It is pretty loud though, so don't go here for a romantic evening."}
{"text":"Fresh does not focus an local nor organic food. Just ask the waiter or waitress."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, good atmosphere a bit cluttered. Vegan selection is an interesting take. Had the full breakfast and Pancakes. Taste pretty good, would go again to try burgers and wraps."}
{"text":"I just....love this place so much. Throughout my visits I've had myriads of grassy smoothies/juices, faux-burgers, and my favourite delight, the cashew cookie (made from pure grinded cashews then pressed together in the shape of a cookie). Sometimes the burgers are not as great, but the bowls are generally fool proof because they're relatively simple, and the dishes rely mainly on the combination and freshness of the ingredients.

There's something about a good vegetarian place that makes me go back every time. Maybe it's the idea that vegetables can replace meat, or the seamless pairings of exotic ingredient that makes every meal at this place a culinary adventure.

In response to the other Yelper's bad reviews, fortunately I've been too busy stuffing my face into my forest of greens on all my visits to have been significantly affected by any bad service. However, using \"hipsters\" as an all-encompassing term in reference to their general lack of service would serve the Bohemian community injustice. One can simply use \"asshole\" in reference to their inattentive and self-righteous attitudes."}
{"text":"I try to eat at least 1 vegetarian meal a week to avoid scurvy and this place is one of my favorites.  I'm a big fan of their burrito and their BBQ burger. You can also customize all the food with lettuce wraps or wrap instead of bun, which is a good option to have when there's a need. The space inside though is very tight and the restaurant is often really busy since there aren't too many vegan restaurants around. I usually order takeout and pick it up instead."}
{"text":"I visited this place while I was in town and I loved it. The selection of gluten free items was incredible. I had an all star salad with Sriracha vinaigrette dressing with a rose hips kombucha and my husband had green poutine with sweet potato fries. Both were delicious. The portion sizes were gigantic and the amount of toppings on the salad were impressive but not overwhelming. The seating was a little cramped but the service was good and as I said the quality of the food was fresh and great. My only complaint was that the prices were a little high, but you do get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?! This was not my first time eating at Fresh. When I moved here from Montreal a month ago, I went three, maybe four days in a row. I was excited to find a place I love as much as Aux Vivres (a vegan restaurant in the Plateau, in Montreal).

I came with my friend who loves meat. Yet, she also loved this place as well, and was excited to try it with me after hearing how great it was from friends. I ordered the garden salad (grated carrot, red pepper, sunflower sprout & pumpkin seeds on salad greens) and selected the green dressing (ginger, garlic, cilantro, rice vinegar, agave & sunflower oil). I also ordered the grilled corn bread (which is yeast free and gluten free) and we shared the quinoa-battered onion rings. My taste buds were in heaven! Though they have a large menu with lots of different things to try, and many sauces and dressings to choose from, I always want the same thing because it is just that good!

I also like that they have smoothies, juices and other liquid treats that both sound amazing and benefit your health as well. One of these days, I will go in for a smoothie and actually order it, rather than my usual salad and bread. 

Hands down, amazing food, great service, and the decor is cool too!!"}
{"text":"Fresh is consistently one of my favourite restaurants in the city and they rarely ever disappoint. Everything is always delicious"}
{"text":"This is the place you'd want to bring veg and non-veg friends alike.
Most food items pack flavour, and most items are healthy to boot.  I love the freshness at fresh.  Fresh veggies, fresh garnishes (occasionally), fresh and trendy (fashionable; indie-types of...) servers.

Vegan and gluten-free friendly, as well.

other: Fresh is said to be a great spot to people watch.

not so great: slow wait time, to get it.  best that you make an rsvp or avoid Fresh altogether from Friday-Sunday.  Esp. if you've got any level of agoraphobia - the place gets crowded if not packed for most dinners and from Fri-Sun, as mentioned.

Call ahead and allow 15-20 for food to be ready for pick-up."}
{"text":"I need to update my review unfortunately. This restaurant used to be my go to place for lunch meetings when I am on the downtown UofT campus. However, I will avoid this chain from now on. The owner, Barry Alper, is actively lobbying against bike lines on Bloor. Let me repeat that, a vegetarian restaurant is lobbying against a bike line with ~10k daily users. Getting to the restaurant *alive* is one of my priorities, as cyclist. This restaurant is clearly not taking the safety of its customers seriously and I don't feel welcome here anymore. It's even more ironic, if you read the restaurants about page: it aims to \"reduce our impact on the earth and its resources\". Yeah, I think in the end they simply aim to get as much money out of a bunnies as possible."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Catherine M... Fresh is way OVERRATED. 

I've gone here about 7 or 8 times thinking maybe the experience will be better.... well that never happened.. so why go back?? a friend of mine loves it.. shame.. 

besides being busy all the time so it takes 10 min to get a table and everyone is so close together. Nevertheless, the food isn't that great either.. what I usually order (can't remember the name of it but it's basmati rice with avocado, red peppers, sun dried tomatoes,ect.) comes too much spice or with no spice at all.. it's never consistent. 

The service is okay, but if it's busy don't expect to get out quickly, unless you tell them ahead of time.

So I just answered the additional tips part of the review and although it is wheelchair accessible it would be really awkward to get through the tables because it's just really tight in there."}
{"text":"Arrived here for 6:30 on a Saturday with a party of 4 and it was $&'nig packkkkkked. We were lucky to grab a table. 

Starting off we got the quinoa onion rings, dragon fries and buffalo cauliflower. All were delicious. Onion rings were crispy, cauliflower was fresh and came out nice and hot with just a right amount of Buffalo dressing. The dragon fries were topped with banana peppers and had some real heat to them. Also delicious. 

For dinner I personally had the falafel tacos. 2 for $10. I honestly didn't think that it would fill me but these bad boys came LOADED with veggies and onion strings. Falafel itself inside was delicious (2 per taco). Also got to sample my SO's meal \"Ace of KALE\". Again. Delicious. Literally everything we ordered was delicious. And I am in no way vegan or a lover of vegetarian food. 

This was my first time here and I will absolutely be back. Everything tastes great, the place was neat and very hip. The service was amazing. 

4/5 for me!!"}
{"text":"Back in the day this was my local Fresh location. I now prefer the Queen W location, but when passing through The Annex this indoor-only bustling location will do. 

Menu staples for me are the black bean wrap and their soup/salad/cornbread combo. Their cornbread is my favourite. I also enjoy their dosas, but be warned that is a solid meal and not just an appetizer. Turns out, vegans can eeeeeeat. 

When ordering, be aware that getting fresh juices will really spike your bill price, but are often worth it. My face? Beet, apple and ginger. 

PEPPER'S PISSSED: They discontinued their wasabi dressing! This is the first time I've ever asked for a comment card in a restaurant... I am deeply saddened by this. Thank God I have veggie friends with the recipe books. (Merci, Kat F!)"}
{"text":"I did not like this location as much as the other one I've been to.  Maybe I would be of a different opinion on a different day.  It is so incredibly hot right now and it was unbearable inside plus I felt it did not look too clean.
The food however...  The food!  My husband and I shared a black bean tostada.  Some quinoa breaded onion rings, I had a Thai veggie burger and he had some bowl (Power Bowl, mabye?)  It was all amazing and I managed to get over my heat induced bad mood.  Would I be back?  Yes I would."}
{"text":"I am nowhere near a vegan but I LOVE Fresh!!

I tried it for the first time about a year ago when my cousin introduced me to it and have been back many times ever since for lunch, brunch, dinner, and take out. I've tried many different things on the menu but I'll list my favourites

-Mega life salad
-Tiger bowl (not available during brunch for some odd reason)
-quinoa onion rings

The mega life salad is my absolute favourite! the 3-6-9 dressing is a must try and anything with the tofu cubes or steaks is amazing!

The first time I ate here I was worried that 1) I wouldn't like it and 2) it wouldn't be filling. Let me tell you, not only did I love it but it was beyond filling! It's hard to finish a meal usually!

Bowls are great for if you're super hungry and recently they added the baby bowl option for a smaller size. What I love about bowls is that they either come with rice or noodles but if you don't want either you can just ask for more veggies!

The restaurant itself is always packed! They don't take reservations so you're always waiting but they wait is definitely worth it! So is the fact that the tables are so close together. It's a cute little intimate environment.

I would recommend Fresh to anyone, even big meat lovers. Change is good right?"}
{"text":"Great food. Unpretentious. Great vibe. One of the best vegan restaurants I've been to, and I've been to many."}
