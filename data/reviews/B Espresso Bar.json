{"text":"I first heard about this place in a magazine (Barista mag. or imbibe maybe?) and at the time I was all about finding really good espresso (still kind of have that problem). So when we visited Toronto, it was a must. I was going to just give this espresso bar just four stars, but I decided to spring for 5 because, really, this is maybe the best cappuccino I've ever had (aside from the ones i used to make.) It's hard to get a correctly made, pleasant cappuccino, and I seldom find myself in a position to scrape out the last creamy bits of perfectly steamed milk with my finger. If its that good, I have no shame. No sugar needed, just warm, sweet milk and espresso. The baristas are friendly, the space is cozy, good for a quiet morning with the paper or some conversation. Those Italians sure know how to make a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"B is located downstairs of my office. When it's raining outside, I can get a sandwich, a salad, a hot drink, or some yummy desserts without having to get wet! Seriously, you just can't beat that sort of convenience.

But it's not just the great location that keeps me coming back to B. Another major factor, rather obviously, is the food. This is some damn delicious cafe food, let me tell you. The sandwiches and wraps are uniquely mouthwatering combinations of awesomeness and I'm always satisfied with their salads as well, especially the pasta salad with ricotta, grape tomatoes, and roasted red peppers. And there's the desserts. I've tried a couple of cookies and have always enjoyed them, but when a place sells cupcakes, you know that's always going to win me over. They don't have them every day, but when their chocolate cuppies are in the display case, I'm all over it.

The other reason I love B is the service. Every employee I've ever encountered there has been super nice, super friendly, and super helpful. It's really quite a pleasure to be served by the staff at this cafe.

If I could, I'd give B a 4.5 star rating. I'm reluctant to give it a full 5 out of 5 because it definitely is rather pricey. I'd love to get my lunch from here every work day, but that would be a surefire way to blow my month's budget in only five days time. (I exaggerate, but not by that much!)

Oh, and don't ask me about the quality of the espresso -- I actually hate coffee!"}
{"text":"Really nice little spot - it feels a bit tucked away for Queen and Church - a good thing. Really nice coffee, charming staff, and great ambiance & music. Glad I stumbled across it. 

Seating is a bit communal, but on this particular day I am fine with that. And the clientele seems interesting, so if I had to share, that might be fun, too."}
{"text":"They make great espresso drinks (as they should given their name). Their food -- I've had their sweets and wraps -- are pretty good, but on the pricey side, so I typically only come here for coffee. I take mine to go and sit outside on the benches in Philosopher's Walk when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"In my opinion, illy coffee is one of the better brands and b Espresso Bar serves it up nice and hot. I love their Espresso and their Americano. 

So why not 5 stars? Their hours are fucked. I think they close everyday at 5pm. Now that's just (s)illy. (See what I did there? illy - silly? I'm a genius.)"}
{"text":"I used to work down the street from b Espresso and would sometimes drop in for lunch/coffee. Their coffee is top notch, and possibly the best I've had (although it is pretty hard to beat the lattes from Cafe Art Java in Montreal!). The baristas are very friendly.

It does get quite busy during the lunch hour, but it's worth the wait. I've had both the Pollo and Patate pizzas and they were delicious - flavourful and fresh!"}
{"text":"Best lunch in the neighbourhood for a tenner. Great coffee, too!"}
{"text":"This cafe is located in the atrium of the Royal Conservatory of Music. Enter through the path (which becomes Philosopher's Walk) just east of the conservatory, in between the conservatory and the Royal Ontario Museum.

I've held a couple meetings here when wanting to get out of the office. It's bright and airy. There are also plenty of tables to spread out on. Seems like an ideal study space.

I'll admit I'm not a big coffee fan, but the cortado (an espresso cut with a bit of steamed milk) was quite delicious. 

A nice find overall."}
{"text":"Nice place for a coffee or even a work meeting. The table layout is actually quite inspired for the layout of the space. Not so in love with the temperature (was freezing and felt the door to the winter outside was open the whole time). Not a fan of $5+ americanos either. Still a good option in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"On my first morning in Toronto on vacation from NYC I got up from the hotel  looking for good coffee. 

Only had the dark drip coffee but it was spectacular on a mid-morning weekday.  Everyone was very helpful and super nice.  Blueberry scone was rich and not too sweet, carrot cake very moist and the croissant looked great.

Lunch  looked great as well but the kids weren't ' ready for it."}
{"text":"This place reminding FatCat of pretty girl who relying too much on her looks;  Looking good (yummy),  taking lots of money and not providing much substance in return (not yummy). FatCat need better balance.

Things FatCat Like:
 - Beautiful atrium to sit in while trying to enjoy lackluster food (next time just get coffee and enjoy atrium).

Things FatCat not like:
 - Luke-warm soup (FatCat like soup piping hot in winter time).
 - Below average sandwich (toasted on outside, cold in middle, size a little small).
 - Paying $15 for $10 meal.

Overestimating value of good looks is mistake many ladies making (underestimating is also mistake, but not as big).  FatCat thinking ladies lose incentive to do other things in life when looks is above average.  

Its like getting burger with too much meat, but not enough toppings or buns.  Balance of ingredients making burger more yummy than just adding more meat."}
{"text":"Bit of a creative industry-businessy crowd. No patio but very air conditioned! Very good coffee"}
{"text":"Had a pleasant time here after a trip to the ROM. Was going to go across to Gabbys or Potbelly but the construction made it so that we would have to cross the street a full three times - too annoying . So we (sister, 4 year old and 8 year old) came to this cafe instead.

Space is nice, cafeteria style but with classical music playing and the sun shining through from the roof. I had a roast beef sandwich and a chicken fig salad, seemed overpriced but you aren't tipping so they probably make up for that with jacking up the prices. I enjoyed both items, definitely tasted as I expected. Good option immediately around the museum."}
{"text":"Good cortado....the red tiles make for an interesting zing....was happy with my coffee!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, as I used to frequent the Royal Conservatory of Music. It's located right in the atrium of the building, which is very convenient if you're a student in the building. 

The last time I came here, I was on tour with the McGill Symphony Orchestra, and a few of us met up with members of the Royal Conservatory Orchestra for a coffee. It is very spacious inside, with lots of natural light. This is perhaps one of my favorite aspects of this café. 

I ordered a cortado, which was well made but not spectacular. I did notice that their juices were quite expensive. I would stick to their coffees, as the beans seem pretty consistent. 

The natural light makes this is a great location to sit down and read or study. If you're looking for the best coffee in the area, go to Sorry Coffee Co instead."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Have been here once before on a weeknight for a concert and treated by a friend. Came down for another errand today and was so looking forward to killing 1.5 hours here with a nice beverage in the beautiful building. Well, the building is still beautiful, but that's about it. It's busy and full of children so you know it's not going to be spotless, but not one staff is doing floor detail and it does not need to be this dirty. I order my double cappuccino, which doesn't look as good as the photos posted by the business. I think they forgot to put the espresso in the machine because it tastes like warm, watery milk. To \"top it\" all off, the worst sin a retail food counter can commit in my business commandments: I'm charged full 13% sales tax on the $4.00 item. The staff can't do anything about it because the manager doesn't come in on weekends, but she'll let him know. Meantime I've paid the 13% instead of 5% and I am not happy about it. Does anyone remember the article about the cheque that bounced because the account was $0.01 short and therefore got hit with the $45.00 NSF fee? I'm glad I have that $0.50 extra to cover the bills coming out of my account this weekend.
Between that and the lack of cleanup, I no longer have any appetite to try anything else.
Good riddance, there are a lot more cafés in this neighbourhood to enjoy."}
{"text":"They pour a mean latte here using top notch illy espresso and perfectly steam milk with just a touch of froth on top and it is hot too to boot. 

The decor is very modern european, almost like a cafe straight out italy with sleek marble communal tables, red tiled bar and a flat screen tv playing european footie on the side. Not really a fan of the layout, I don't mind communal tables and all, but it's a little cramped sitting alongside a slab and not around a table-not much space for each person.

 And as Jon S. mentioned their hours are crazy short-they close at 5pm everyday-show me a late, late coffee shop in toronto that isn't Timmie's or Starbucks and I'm there! But they do have great coffee, friendly staff and fresh, tasty food and for that I salute them."}
{"text":"Honestly speaking, I would give this amazing location a 5 star rating, but the pricing is higher than I would like. 

I have thoroughly enjoyed their salads, soups, sandwiches, and desserts over the past 1.5 years; I would consider myself a frequent customer and familiar face by now. The atmosphere is great- relaxed, cozy, and friendly. And the staff is amazing. 

My go-to food items are the quiche, protein muffins, pesto chicken sandwich, turkey avocado sandwich, Thai noodle chicken salad, and too many soups to name. They also have a few sweet treats available such as brownies, tarts, and cookies. 

I'm not a coffee person so I cannot tell you how it is, but if it's anything like their food options, service, and atmosphere, I'd say it's outstanding. 

If you have a moment, stop by spend your lunch break in this little cafe (seating is limited). Bring a friend too!"}
{"text":"Delicious lattes, beautiful decor, but turn off that horrible 80s music!

This place is a charming cafe with nice staff and the coffees are top notch. Unfortunately, I was there for about 30 minutes one recent morning and the awful music made it difficult to enjoy my latte. It was unrecognizable (to me) music that sounded like synthesized 80s pop and was way too loud, to boot.

I recommend getting your coffee to go."}
{"text":"Love the staff with lots of heart, the classy but simple decor, and the people that hang out.  I'm actually writing this from a tablet that I thought I lost there.  When I returned, the staff had kept it in safe keeping for me, and not only that, one of the staff, James, offered me a free espresso.  It's as if he knew I was having a rough week.  I'm not in the neighborhood but I would go there all the time if I were."}
{"text":"What a nice open little cafe located in the beautiful addition to the conservatory!  It's a nice setting, the coffee is pretty good, served in real cups, and I had an excellent chocolate zucchini bread.  Friendly servers, too.  I wish the conservatory that I went to had had such a cafe on-site..."}
{"text":"This hip little coffee bar is tucked away off Yonge St. in a loft-type building. I came here to celebrate my day-off and was very impressed with the interior décor.

Their coffee is fresh and smooth. I still required the three sugars I require but it was delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed every sip. I accompanied my coffee with a coconut chocolate cookie, which in the end wasn't my favourite but was freshly baked.

Price point is very reasonable at the two items coming in at just over $5. Service was friendly and they provide an inviting atmosphere that encourages you to sit for a while. I wouldn't make a special trip to come back to this place but if I was in the area, I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Located just east of Church Street and Queen Street East, right in between the Carbon Bar and George Restaurant, this isn't a bad option if you're in the area. They have a good selection of drinks and specialty beverages, some pastries and sandwiches. 

Ambiance is quite intimate - long communal tables, dimmer lighting. It's a nice place to do some work (if you don't mind sharing a table), and to meet friends or dates for a small get-together. I also saw a few small work meetings congregated in small huddles at various parts of the communal tables. This shop isn't too noisy, music is nice and relaxing. It definitely has a more chill, laid-back vibe.

I ordered a single Americano and paid around $2.70. Coffee was fresh and decent; it wasn't as nice and smooth as I thought it would be, but it was basically alright. 

Coupled with the atmosphere, this is a nice spot to do some work if you're so inclined (compared to other coffee shops in the area that are louder in atmosphere). But if you're looking for a more lively environment, this might not be what you're looking for. A decent café overall."}
{"text":"I come here often for the breakfast bagel sandwich.  It might be a bit small for some, but it tastes really, really good! Soft, chewy, flavorful bagel, herbed omelette, real cheese, and above all, it's served HOT. I hate nothing more than luke-warm food. I book it here from work all the time for this thing. What can I say, it has a hold on me. 

I can't get behind the lunch offerings, however. Is anyone else sick of wraps, ciabatta and \"panini\" (this is an excuse for stale bread, right)? I, for one, am excited for the day fluffy, chewy-but-non-jaw breaking bread comes back into fashion. 

Service can also be a bit hit-and-miss. Coffee is wonderful considering the area if you're coming North from UofT (where there's nothing but TimBucksCup)."}
{"text":"I sought this place out when my wife and I were in Toronto several months ago. The coffee is okay, but the food and the design were terrific. A really great space for a brief chat but not a place to linger over a cup of coffee and a book.

The quiche is delicious."}
{"text":"The music is back!

Passed through a couple of times and had a coffee there today.

A much better experience.  The place seems to have perked up with better food choices.

Coffee still very good.  Great space. 

Thanks for paying attention!"}
{"text":"I always want to come here because I like the b espresso bar inside Koerner Hall, but this one is closed on weekends and only open 'til 5pm on weekdays. I had the afternoon off today, so came by to do some reading. 
I had a latte, which was rich, and velvety smooth (illy espresso, natch). I overheard them telling another customer that they roast their own coffee beans in some far away place, like Woodstock. I didn't try any food options, although they have a large selection of pre-made wraps, what looked like a Spanish omelette, salads, soup of the day (potato leek), and desserts. Service was smooth and efficient. 
It's not really a linger and study kind of place. The people here seem important -- they wear suits and carry briefcases. Some people stopped by for lunch while reading the newspaper, others seemed to be on business meetings. There's a nice booth at one end of the room, a long communal table, and seating by the window. The cafe is located in the same building as Verity, but you can't use Verity's wifi and they don't have their own wifi (-1 star). The whole atmosphere is sleek but kind of sterile. Music was nothing I recognized, but inoffensive. CP24 played silently from the flat screen by the door. 
A decent place for a pit stop if you happen to be in the area, but not somewhere I would go out of the way to visit."}
{"text":"$5 for a \"smoothie\" which consists of fruit purée out of a store-bought bottle with some ice."}
{"text":"I love good coffee. So I get excited about new coffee places. I'm very loyal and will go out of my way to buy coffee there whenever I can, until I get a bad coffee, then another, and another. At this point the scale tips and the cost of walking an extra few minutes to get my coffee outweighs the value of *the chance* that I might get a good coffee. Today my drip coffee from B was a watery mess. In the past it was a glorious Italian Roast. Strike 1."}
{"text":"I work near here once a week at the moment so it's my treat to get a proper coffee for a change.  Their Americanos are pricey but they're real coffee with a gorgeous crema and taste silky smooth.  Mmmm.  I don't think my budget would quite cope with it being my main coffee place anyway so it's probably a good thing that I'm only in the area infrequently.

Staff are friendly but service isn't super speedy.  I forgive them for taking their time though when I taste my creamy coffee.  

There's a selection of wraps, paninis and some cookies and pastries.  The selection isn't huge but it always looks fresh and tasty.  Prices are quite high though and they have a strange odd number pricing system where, for example, a cupcake costs $3.57.  Trying to figure out what combination of things could make my total an even number is the stuff of sleepless nights.

I like the decor which makes a small space seem open and is bright and clean.  It hasn't been too packed any lunchtime when I've wandered in.  Maybe people were doing as I did and heading outside to enjoy the sunshine.  It's unfortunate that the closest green area is outside the Metropolitan United Church.   It's one of those park areas where I begin to doubt the appropriateness of my shoe choice.  A sudden sprint is definitely a possibility there-either away from a knife or after your handbag.

For friendly service and genuinely good coffee though, cross the road and pop into B!"}
{"text":"There is better coffee people. I had the deep honour of watching my barista make me a coffee with Illy coffee and then fake the latte art with a stick at the end. Just so you know - a real artist can do it with the milk.

This coffee to my left is nothing special. I really didn't appreciate the woman who shouted at me about crossing arms while we both got our beverages. 

I am still on the hunt for a good americano on Bloor West! HELP!"}
{"text":"I drink coffee here every day, and it's always reliable. It's a good bean, and they have a great selection of snacks and sandwiches for lunch. They are a bit pricey, so I don't eat there every day, but it is really good."}
{"text":"The flavoured ice coffees are really good. Small serving but really good--much better than the nearby Starbucks. There's one girl there (with brown hair) that makes a better ice coffee than the rest. I'd always hope that she would make it when I'd go. Been there a few times. The food is good too for a quick bite. 

No wifi unfortunately. I think it'd be a great place to tuck away in and do work if they had wifi. It's pretty low key compared to other places."}
{"text":"I stopped for a quick coffee before an appointment. It's such a modern, bright coffee shop. So pretty and enjoyable to sit down! I ordered the cafe au lait (very delicious). Sat in the communal table farthest from the cash (i.e. closest to entrance). And the wi fi signal is just not strong! I went back to the cash register to inquire on the wi-fi and discovered a different signal which did accept the password. Once I was logged in, I didn't lose the signal back at my seating."}
{"text":"Great selection of espresso based drinks. Trendy, fast paced music too! Great place to hangout with friends or have a meeting at."}
{"text":"B Espresso Bar is just plain awesome! The owner is from Italy and had the place designed by the well-known Ciccone Simone interior design firm. It has a fantastic industrial look with the exposed ceilings, red-tiled back wall, a delish display of food offerings, and long marble counters for communal seating. During the week, they're open till 5 and on Thursdays till midnight! They serve wine, Illy espresso, and yummy juices. But the draw for me are their panini! While not cheap, they have some great combinations like the catullo (chicken with pesto, cheese and zucchini), grilled veggies, and also yummy wraps. Try coming in the morning for a cappuccino and chocolate croissant- so European!!"}
{"text":"Like my other experiences with B Espresso Bar this one was A-OK. I find there are two types of coffeeshop aesthetic in Toronto:

a) wood, earthy palette, warm aroma, cozy sun-kissed atmosphere
b) porcelain, sleek, clean lines, linea Italiana, cool

B falls into the latter category, which for me is harder to love. The set up in here is a little strange though you enter from the side, the café is extremely wide and squat. Like the café is a panorama. A communal table that runs the length of the place is similarly shaped and I felt as though it could barely fit my notebook. There are few tables and looking oddly-out-of-place is large booth that seats about six.

The coffee is OK, but as others have mentioned the service is deliberately paced. And I also had to repeat my order no less than four times to three different people. I ordered a small brewed coffee! I don't think they were expecting that.

I'll opt for the wood, thank you. (No wait.)

Obligatory Title Pun: B is A-OK.

Menu Readability: Yeah, yeah.

Need to mention: No wifi, suckers.

What this place teaches me about myself: Unlike my grades in highschool, I strive for As when it comes to coffeeshops."}
