{"text":"I ate here yesterday and I eat lots of ethnic food , I grew up eating this food and I feel like I am gonna die. The server was also a weirdo who kissed my white husbands butt and assumed he was paying...hilarious. This place also has a privacy screen in front of the kitchen, now I know why, they are hiding fugitives named Sam and Ella."}
{"text":"Great food!!!!  Great service!  True authentic mexican food!!! We had tacos, gorditas, and enchiladas!   Amazinf fresh food!!"}
{"text":"Excellente Birria, ceviche, tacos etc!  Pa que salir a buscar otro lugar ya que aqui esta super y a buen precio!  Gracias por su servicio.  Great mexican food and resonably priced."}
{"text":"Good authentic Mexican, a lot of menu options, great service, nice quite atmosphere."}
{"text":"Enchiladas, sopa de tortilla and sopes are delicious! Place is clean and service is gracious! Have been here more than 5 times with my son and he loves the pancakes!"}
{"text":"I just had dinner tonight at Cocina Real and was fairly disappointed by the evening.  My girlfriend and I were seated next to the kitchen area, which gave us a clear view of the staff handling the food.  We noticed right away that the wait staff use their bare hands to grab from a large, community drawer of chips for the chips and salsa that are brought to every table.  This was somewhat disturbing seeing as they are constantly touching dirty plates and towels.  We mentioned this to the manager who told us there was, in fact, a sanitary device for handling the chips (there was not).  He then proceeded to the back of the kitchen to bring out a box of white rubber gloves for the staff to use for grabbing the chips.  This thoroughly confused the wait staff, half of whom put one glove on and wore it for at least the remainder of our dinner.  After about an hour, the manager returned to our table and informed us that our waiter forgot to enter our order in the system.  Our orders were then rushed through and finally our meals made it to the table.  My girlfriend received the completely wrong dish, but chose to settle for it due to the time we had already been waiting.  Besides the sanitary issues, the other problems were understandable mistakes for a restaurant trying to get used to a new location.  Unfortunately, for the problems with our experience, the manager only removed the two sodas we ordered from the bill instead of the wrong meal my girlfriend received.  Our waiter did apologize for the inconvenience, but it did not feel right that they were satisfied enough with their service to charge us essentially full price.  Overall, the food was okay, but if we go back it will not be until the online reviews improve."}
{"text":"The door here is awesome and the servers are friendly and quick to get what you need as well as make recommendations on the best ways to enjoy the food. The ambience may be a bit lacking, but it's easily made up for by the delicious food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison - and I think it is the best one in town.  Here's what I like:  The House Guacamole - Heaven! I always order this, and the last time, we had a table side preparation, a clear demonstration on how fresh the food is here - another thing that I love about this place - the abundance of fresh food. In all its simplicity, it's perfect.  The salsa - I've disappointed all over Madison with other Mexican restaurant's salsa, and even for that matter, all over the Midwest and parts of California. I've had the best salsa here - again very simple, but very delicious - and isn't that what matters? Food should be delicious, especially food at any restaurant.  The chips - so good, so delicious. Yes, seems so silly to rate the free chips, but again another sign that this restaurant cares about how food tastes and only serves the best of ingredients and food.  As mentioned above, the abundance of fresh ingredients, especially fresh vegetables, in all dishes.  As for the other entrees, I've never been disappointed. Take your pick - they're all good.  This restaurant has actually moved, and is no longer located on University Ave. They are now on Allen Bvld. I think they have settled in to their new place, and service is back on par.  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Mi Cocina is my favorite Mexican-style restaurant in the Madison area.  I have never come away unimpressed with either the food or the service.  I can't really speak to authenticity since I wouldn't really know it if I saw it, but for what they do Mi Cocina does it well.  All I do know is that I have gotten my favorites here over and over without ever having any problems.  The staff is always friendly and fast which sets the place apart from several other area restaurants of the genre.  If only for consistency I would rate Mi Cocina a three, and with never having a bad meal I definitely would go with a high 3.5 - 4 stars.  Last time I had the fried tilapia tacos, and I especially enjoyed the spicy cream-based sauce that was served on the side.  It was perfectly seasoned for my taste, though it was a bit hot for my mother.  The tilapia was lightly fried and was still tender.  The accompanying refried beans were decent, and served to allow for the spice from the tacos to dissipate.  I still put the blackened tilapia tacos at Tex Tubbs at the top of my favorites list, but these easily jumped to the #2 position.  On previous trips I've gotten flautas, which were perfectly fried and not too crispy, and the enchiladas sonora, which comes with an excellent spinach and a creamy sauce.  I also really enjoy the cheese and mushroom quesidilla and the fajitas.  My sister, who is lactose-intolerant, had found the menu a bit dairy-laden, but she did end up finding a chicken breast entree that is now her favorite.  The prices are quite reasonable and given the amount of food always a good deal.  Mi Cocina probably won't ever be held up as a paragon of the style, but it has always been reliable and enjoyable and for that I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great place! Very authentic Mexican food. Food is made to order so it isn't quick, wait, it's worth it. Fantastic! If you are within an hour...go here!"}
{"text":"Finally a homemade style Mexican food close to home! The service was good. The food was excellent, and so were the fresh made agua frescas. The food is made to order for those that are a bit inpatient(didn't think it took long). Can't wait to come back and try other menu items. The food is fairly priced."}
{"text":"Wasn't what I expected. Ordered the gorditas and they were mediocre, however, not authentic."}
{"text":"This is a family run start-up.  Very basic basic furnishing but it's very clean. They've only been open a little over two months. We ordered the Culichi Especial and the Gorditas.  Beautifully Plated. ...fresh lovely ingredients and very tasty!   Service was fast,  server was helpful and friendly! The salsa was homemade and HOT! The Culichi Especial was definitely CRAVE ABLE!   We will be back! Overlook the furnishings and go enjoy the food!"}
{"text":"Great food. Sinaloa style family style food. Owners are friendly and very welcoming. Would eat here over and over."}
{"text":"What a find! In town for baseball and wanted something casual but tasty. This hit the spot. Located in a strip mall, friendly service and excellent food. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wow amazing food! We came in late and they were closing shop, but they still served us! We good one roll and some gorditas. The food was delicious. We took it to go and it was ready in about 15 min. The furniture and seating is lacking but I don't go to restaurants for the chairs and tables, it's the food! My wife and I were very satisfied and will go again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly environment!  Highly recommend!  My favorite is the birria and enchilada suizas."}
{"text":"The food is decent, the service is better than your average Madison restaurant and the bathrooms were clean.  It is a bit out of our way but it is consistent enough to warrant more visits."}
{"text":"This is a gem. Looks like a hole in the wall but we went on a mission for Mexican sushi. Really good stuff. Big portions and the rolls are big to begin with. I've gone multiple times now and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner here. I had a fantastic fajita platter, which included beef, chicken, shrimp, and the requisite peppers and onions, but also whole scallions and tomato wedges. Delicious! The guacamole was decent, though a little bland. And my husband's mole sauce was just OK. But I really liked the spicy salsa they brought to the table when I requested it.  The service was pretty great; there was a whole team of servers that were constantly checking up on us to make sure we were doing OK. Every time we had a special request (see: the spicy salsa), they were right on top of it.  But what I REALLY liked was the margaritas; our table had a pitcher of blended strawberry margaritas, and they were absolutely perfect. Blended just right with no big chunks of ice; perfectly balanced strawberry and tequila flavor. I could have consumed that whole pitcher by myself without even putting in too much effort. Yum!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and the gal that served me was very helpful with the menu and making recommendations.  I had the Taco's Dorados and they were fantastic. I also had an order of beans with pork and they were also really good. The salsa that they give you to dip your chips is really spicy and had great flavor.  Highly recommend this place and I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"First of I would like to say WOW!! Amazing food, great customer service & friendly atmosphere! This is a small family startup restaurant for which I could definitely see great potential for in the near future! Small improvements to be made but I am sure they will come once this place starts getting the attention it should be getting!! If you have not tried this place you have to. When my family and I first walked in her ( I have to be honest) were a little skeptical but in the end we are so glad we did! Don't be fooled by the furnishings and decorations (they are just starting guys). This is REAL Mexican food reminds me of back home. BTW they make fresh handmade tortillas from scratch!!! Bomb.com"}
{"text":"Small place but food has been great! Haven't been disappointed with anything on the menu. Service it friendly and they will offer explanations of dishes with out hesitation. Try the Mexican sushi it's has been a revelation, much better than the traditional seafood sushi experience, just my opinion. Very clean as well."}
{"text":"Love the food very authentic! the wait was long due to the restaurant being very busy. Besides that everything was delicious and very clean"}
{"text":"Not enough servers at their new location. Decent good food, but they don't care about serving their customers. Feedback to the manager fell on a deaf ear. After visiting Mi Cocina/Cocina Real for years I was looking forward to the new decor. I would prefer the old place there servers offered too much than the new location where you are lucky if you get food and even luckier if it's the right food. If you go when it's busy, beware."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic very authentic great tasting not disappointed at all I highly recommend this place to anyone who's feeling Mexican food"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful when trying to decide what to order.  I had the beef enchiladas. The beef was AMAZING. My husband got the dorados with beef broth.  The broth was amazing as well.  We're definitely coming back (and this place is nowhere near our house!)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for some good authentic Mexican food and ended up here !   So happy we did!   The menu does not have a lot of options and it's a little hard to read. Our server told us they are working on getting a new one that is easier to read. I didn't mind it.   I couldn't decide between two and asked the server for a recommendation. He recommended the birria. It was delicious! It tasted like my grandma made it at her house for my little cousins birthday party! So happy. It came with tortillas, cilantro onions and cabbage.  My boyfriend had the tostadas. They are a little different because they mix their meat with potatoes so naturally he was a little skeptical. He really liked them however!   Pricing is good for a place that has a server. Our server was friendly and he ended up talking with us for a while. We figured it was because we were the only ones left but he definitely didn't have to since they were closed already. He didn't make us feel rushed at all.   Great food and good customer service. We will definitely be back! Thanks Victor !"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Discovered this place about a month or 2 ago. First time having Sinaloa style sushi but definitely did not disappoint. The sushi takes a little longer than normal food orders to prepare but worth the wait. I usually get the culichi which is on the menu a house favorite. Last visit all 4 of our party ordered one roll each and they were HUGE, nobody was able to finish there roll would recommend sharing. Micheladas are a must, ordered with modelo especial. Tacos and flautas (rolled tacos) are delicious too, tacos have home made tortillas and flautas I generally don't get wowed but these sure did, pretty safe to say from our couple visits everything there is good."}
{"text":"Good food, good quick service!  Steak tacos the best.  Chicken quesadillas also good."}
{"text":"The service is amazing!  I was treated like a VIP!  The exterior is a little rough but the sushi estillo sinaloa is delicious!    I love this place!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent like nothing I ever had. I also love the salsa spicy and delicious"}
{"text":"Visiting from cali and this place did not dissapoint!! Enchiladas were amazing!! We will stop by again next year on our spring training trip!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my daughter were kind of sad because we weren't really that hungry when we went in and I really wanted to try their \"Mexican sushi\" as I have never heard of this before. We ended up just getting the supreme nachos and sharing them but they were very good! The service was great and very friendly. Coming back again for sure and trying out their sushi!"}
{"text":"While on my way to a nearby Thai restaurant I saw the sign that read, \"Estilo Sinaloan sushi.\"  So I decided to check out Mi Cocina Mexican Food.  I learned they've only been open for a month. The staff was helpful and did not hover, which is what I prefer. I was informed that all the sushi is fried.  To satiate my hunger I ordered a side of guacamole and chips while I waited for sushi.   My chicken sushi rolls came out with three different sauces.  One reminded me of a chipotle aioli, the other a sweet mango sauce with a hint of heat and then the third, which tasted like soy sauce with a bit of lemon.   Even though fried, the sushi was not oily.  The thin layer of breading was just right as was the overall texture of the sushi.   The flavor was subtle, the chicken being subtly salted. The presence of the sauces helped elevate the flavor profile. I'll  definitely check out Mi Cocina again when I'm in the area.  The place itself is small. It's minimalist and clean. Mexican ballads played in the background which reminded me of Luis Miguel."}
{"text":"For advertising Sinalouense food there were hardly any dishes that were typical of Sinaloa. The food was nothing memorable. It seems like they just opened the spot. Prices are fair, however I expected for from a family owned restaurant. I would skip this spot and have tortas across the way."}
{"text":"We came here for my sons after graduation  it was good. We ordered a total of 9 different dishes no one complained we had the barbaccoa it was good. Came in a hot bowl with juice and tortillas on the side. We order 2 sushi rolls. They were ok. My daughter and ex husband got the tacos carne asada and she loved them. My son got dorado tacos and he loved them. All around good food good people but slow service. We waiting a long time for our drinks and she brought us too many. They didn't charge us for the extras she brought but we also didn't drink them so all around win win. Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"Great food and prices, We visited Mi Cocina on a Thursday at lunch time and it was mostly business people enjoying lunch. The food was great, they have complimentary chips & salsa. We also ordered Queso Cheese for the side and it was excellent. I ordered the Texana Quesadilla and it was absolutely delicous. Shrimp, chicken, steak with veggies. I could not believe the flavors and size of the quesadilla. We will be back for sure, this puts Pedro's, and Laredo's to shame. Overall great prices, great food, good service! Don't forget your bucky book coupon!"}
{"text":"I've never had such a delicious gordita besides my moms and a restaurant in Japan. Best gorditas I've ever had! Definitely recommend this place hands down. Best service. Our server was super friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably bad. I finally cancelled my order after 35 minutes, everyone else had their food, but it was served at 5-10 minute intervals.  -Chips and Salsa served, about 15 chips for a table of 5 people. -drinks served intermittently -food served at odd intervals -cancelled Sinaloa Sushi after 35 minutes. Lots of apologizing, but no indication that there would be an extended order time for this.  -we could only find very faint remnants of any kind of meat on 3 different orders. Only potato and very large mounds of shredded lettuce on everything. No difference in flavor or filling from different items. I really don't understand how this place has a 4.7 star rating - it is the worst food experience I have had in Phoenix in 2 years. Maybe people really like potatoes boiled in beef broth?"}
{"text":"Authentic, reasonably priced, and delicious.  I was in the mood for some authentic Mexican food and was craving something reallt south of the border and found myself at Mi Covina.  This little gem of a restaurant serves up Latin American specialties from Ecuador, Peru and Argentina.   The restaurant is small and unassuming. The restaurant was busy the afternoon we dines and a wait for our entrees to arrive however, we didn't complain.  The entrees at Mi Cocina are fresh and natural tasting. The ingredients are simple, but complex in flavor. The entrees are unlike your typical Mexican food restaurant loaded with cheese or heavy sauces. These aren't rays of light, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.  On this visit we had tacos, gorditas, enchiladas, and and Sushi Estillo Sinaloa, and everything was delicious to the very last bite and the Agua Frescas we're so refreshing, light, and flavorful.  If you're in an area you have to stop by and give this place a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food tastes legitimately home cooked! I had a Werito Relleno, not the traditional Chile Relleno but it was amazingly good!"}
{"text":"We liked everything we ordered. Enchiladas with chorizo, tacos dorados, chicken burrito and cheese quesadilla. Chips and salsa also tasty."}
{"text":"Cute clean authentic solid Mexican food and tacos!!  We will come back here for sure. Served chips and salsa when we came in. We ordered guacamole for the chips. The chips were fresh made. The guacamole was fresh and not that weird bagged crap. They only do fish tacos Fri sat, and sun... which is cool cause you know the fish is fresh. I had a fish taco, a carne asada taco, and a bean and cheese burro. The bean and cheese burro was seriously great. The tacos were really good authentic street tacos on the right size tortilla. The tacos were like $2 each and the burrito was like $5. Amazing prices for the quality. They also serve beer which is a nice taco bonus. This place saved taco saturday"}
{"text":"We went for dinner my fiancé and another couple.  I am Mexican and I am a very picky eater but the enchiladas that I had were delicious! OMG they were so good!  I will definitely go there again! The food was full of flavor and I felt like I was at home.  Costumer service was friendly and very attentive.  Best Mexican food in town!"}
{"text":"Sooo... Ok. I live Mexican food. I grew up in Southern California so my standards for Mexican food are high. That being said I assume most places are gonna be bad so that if they are good I'm quite happy.... And if they aren't well... That's what I expected.   This place made me happy and quite upset at the same time. I'll start at the beginning. The chips... Kinda bad. They were super dry and weird. Super weird consistency and zero salt. Our second basket was better, but still lacking. The salsa was ok... Not amazing but not bad. Margaritas were good and seemed to be on the strong side which no one should complain about....ever.  My burrito was actually alright. I had the carnitas burrito and it was good. It needed a bit of spicing up so it asked for hot sauce and another margarita when the waiter checked back. He said no problem. A few min pass and he brings my margarita and says he'll be right bam with the hot sauce. Ok... I'm eating very slowly because I want that hot sauce. It's now been probably 10 min since my margarita came. I don't like eating slow... And I finally say screw it and finish eating. He comes and takes my plate away... And then he brings me the hot sauce to the table. I mean really?  Bottom line, Drinks: Yay! Food: Ehh. Service: Booooo!"}
{"text":"Enchiladas were good, but the burrito was mediocre. Surprised at the 4 and 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"Your new favorite corner of town for authentic mexican cuisine. We came to our favorite respados joint and found this great place that makes their own corn tortillas and chips. Always a great way to make a first impression.   Had the birria tacos. Meat was juicy and tender. Everything tasted really fresh. Awesome setup for desert next door."}
{"text":"We have been here twice and left disappointed both times. First time I got fries and gorditas. I liked that the gorditas had potatoes in them, I never had that before. But there was practically no meat. The fries tasted like straight grease. Decided to give them a second chance since they have such good reviews. This time I got enchiladas and the sauce tasted like it came from a can. The tortilla soup tasted like fried tortillas, and had no meat. I wont be back."}
{"text":"I just want to tell you that this Restaurant is a GEM! My friend Cindy and I stopped there to explore a new place and found this. The TACOS were amazing! She really enjoyed the red wine... MAY we suggest that Mi Cocina adds tequila? Thanks! Well let me tell you, we left to check out another place that shall remain unnamed.... We came back to Mi Cocina, and enjoyed another glass of wine and SOME DELICIOUS GUACAMOLE! It was Karaoke Night... not many karaoke singers... Except David - the COOK! WOW! Simply AMAZING! It also happens to be that my friend and I are not singers... but boy do we love to dance! SO we requested they dim the lights, turn on the disco light for the karaoke machine and play some dance music. Victor, his mom, Maria, and David all joined in on the dancing! We simply loved it! We are definitely going back for tacos, guacamole, and dancing! Thank you! You made our Friday a fun one!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. The menudo was almost all meat just the way I like it. I'll definitely be back to this place."}
{"text":"Ate here once with a buy one, get one coupon. I won't be heading back. Go to Los Gemelos off of State St instead."}
{"text":"Mi Cocina/Cocina Real.-YOU ARE MY RESTAURANT NEMESIS.    BF loves this place. I think it's meh.  The chips and salsa are OK, chips are fresh.  Food comes out extremely fast.    Probably because all they do is pop it under the broiler to get it hot.  Everything that I've had here is just...meh.  Enchiladas are OK because they're relatively simple (cheesy meltiness), the burritos are overly greasy.  They serve a lot of food; when there's leftover food from here, I don't take it home. It's just not very good."}
{"text":"The people their are always very happy , food is great , service is outstanding.  Every time I'm in town I stop by to eat . Birria , tostadas de pollo , dos equis michelada."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this: YELP really does work.. the ratings really do work, and in this case, they're VERY accurate.  I found this place on a whim.. was having coffee with friends, we were hungry, decided to check google for something nearby. Google had this place at 5 stars, which seems hard to believe, so I checked in with Yelp. 4.5 stars? Ok...there might be something to this place.   The restaurant itself is buried deep in a shopping plaza and gets zero street exposure.. best way I can describe it, go to the starbucks on 107th & Indian School, walk to the smoke shop.... turn around, you'll see it. Bad location aside, the restaurant itself isn't really much to look at, no fancy decorations, no bells or whistles. Just a counter, some 4 tops and a nice sized dining room with big family style tables and booths.  Once inside, you'd be hard pressed to find a reason why this is the best damned mexican food in avondale, but decor notwithstanding, that's exactly what this place is.   Starting with the house-made salsa and fresh tortilla chips, you start to get the sense of what you're getting yourself into... the salsa isn't soupy or watery like most typical mexican restaurants.... it's thick, viscous and looks more like marinara than salsa. The taste is unapologetically home-made. Rich and flavorful, smoky and hot; when it's this good, you want to pour it on everything (more on this later). The chips looked hand-made and looked golden brown and fresh from the fryer. Gone in an instant, they were refilled happily and promptly with hot and fresh chips every time we asked.   We ordered the Enchiladas Suizas with rice and beans and opted for the upgraded frijoles puercos (their standard refried beans with added chorizo, a $.75 upcharge) . A few moments later we were regaled with 4 large enchiladas, rice and beans. The enchiladas were saucy, yet held their shape due to the hand-made corn tortillas, overstuffed with moist, perfectly seasoned shredded chicken and topped with all the fixins. The pickled onions are crunchy and add a little bit of an acidic flavor that combines well with savory cheese. The rice was hot and moist, unlike many restaurants, and was very rich and flavorful. The beans were not my favorite, texture wise, but the flavor was unmistakably and unabashedly your abuelita's frijoles maneados; in the best way possible.  As for the enchiladas, I'm biased. Enchiladas are my favorite mexican dish, and the enchiladas suizas are my favorite variety. THESE enchiladas? Best I've ever had.     That awesome salsa I talked about earlier? After the chips were finished, I was reserving the last bit of salsa left in my tiny dipping bowl, knowing I'd want to try it on the enchiladas... lo and behold, the server brings two condiment bottles; one green guacamole type sauce (which looked amazing but I didn't even bother with) and the red bottle of their epic house-made salsa; i poured it on everything. It was glorious.   Victor and his family run the restaurant together and they work very hard at making sure every bite feels like home cooking.  The service is amazing, The food is affordably priced and the menu is simple. Come in, try the amazing food, kiss your old favorite mexican restaurant goodbye."}
{"text":"I'm a fan because of the new location, Bucky Book coupon offering annually, service and the salsa doesn't hurt.   Here's the thing:  Finally found the new location last night and ordered, the similar to Laredo's, Shrimp & Scallop dinner.   The service was fast, courteous and on spot as usual.  This is my first visit since the move.  My order was presented in one bowl - I don't like this. I never want my food to touch and at Laredo's (maybe because they were so busy that night and they were out of the several items to make the dish) this didn't happen.   Mgr. came over to explain I'll have two (2) charges on my card as the server didn't realize I had a coupon so the final charge is what I should expect to remain as he deleted the first. No worries~ Thank you for letting me know.   The salsa: It's nothing horrible by no means. It's not puree. It's not extra chunky. Just simple tasty, spicy salsa with decent chips. It's a solid place for what you need.   The shopping strip is a great value to me as well as Dollar Tree, Ace, Subway, Laundry Mat, Domino's Pizza, the Pharmacy and two other stores are nearby.   Ample parking, well lit lot. The aesthetic appeal of the interior says \"I was once a TAPAS place\" the color scheme and lighting design give you a period piece feel.   Oh~ I think the lighting is too dim without candles on the table so this is a cool setting for date night. The place is spacious and airy with the bar in the middle. The booths are lower than I can recall from other booth spaces through my time in this life but the dish was flavorful - added mushrooms and onions without fuss. Plus the salad was quite fresh. My scallops were seared well.  Server said there'd be pico but that was just chopped tomatoes on lettuce. I know pico.  More than enough to take home."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, great prices and portion sizes. When I crave Mexican food, it's Mi Cocina I want! I like going for lunch on Tuesday - the lunch special is a chicken enchilada."}
{"text":"Delicious! Place is family owned. Very clean, good service. Our waiter, was very friendly and personable. I ordered the beef taquitos and Jamaica. I was also able to trying a chicken enchilada. Everything was very flavorful! I will be back! We got complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was a little too hot for my taste."}
{"text":"The food here was very good. It seemed to be very authentic. I would say that the food is 4.5 stars. The service however, was not very good at all. We had a waitress that started helping us and then we never saw her again. She forgot to put in one of our orders, everyone's entree came out 5-10 minutes apart. I understand if a restaurant is busy but be we were the only one's in there for a majority of our meal.  Great food, bad service."}
{"text":"Ok Mexican like everywhere else. I completely agree with the previous reviewer, \"when is the authentic one coming to this town?\" The menu cover page says it's authentic, but the men items themselves looked little more tex-mex ish. I had a fajita plate while my friend had a chicken dish (I forgot what it was called). My fajita arrived on a sizzling hot plate (that's takes care of the \"fun part\" regardless of the quality), and it was pretty good. The portion was huge, so I had to take ha;f of my plate to go, and the take out became the perfect left-over dinner next day."}
{"text":"Walked in and the woman at the counter was very friendly. However when she came to get our drink order she never came back- we didn't see her the remainder of our meal. After waiting over 5 minutes for water and finally another server came over to help us. The food didn't come at a me time but instead 5 minutes apart. Food was great other than my tacos came out cold.  We will probably return for the food. But I wasn't too happy with the service."}
{"text":"Good food - especially if you're in a hurry.   The service is excellent.    If you're in Brookfield try the Mi Cocina on Bluemound - I believe owned by the same people but the food is bette.r"}
{"text":"I love their taco loco. It's a mouthwatering fajita/taco salad concoction that I  a. can't get enough of and  b. can't finish.  I have tried a few other dishes and nothing ranks near the crazy taco.  Warm, thick chips and a mild salsa are served bountifully. The chips aren't greasy and are not heavily salted which makes me happy. I like to add my own anyway.  They have three versions of guacamole. Yesterday we tried the most basic which was delicious and simple. We also tried an appetizer with cheese and chorizo. It was good, but quickly coagulated which resulted in an undip-able dip.  MARGARITA ALERT- their house margarita... not a traditional margarita. In my opinion, it tasted like watered down orange soda. And the color is a light peach color. If you want a classic, lime margarita I have yet to find one I love here.  I'm not your typical margarita drinker.  The aftermath of too much sweet margarita mix and I do not get along.  I admit,  I'm kind of picky about margaritas, but these, these should have a warning when ordering."}
{"text":"Actually its the same menu as Loredo's, when this first opened alot of the same guys were at both places.  I have been noticing the portions for the Chicken Fajitas has been smaller each time, lots more onions and veggies and less Chicken.  But I always get the hot salsa ( by request only) and that usually makes the meal even better.  Still cant beat the value for the money, its my regular go to lunch spot"}
{"text":"Excellent find and will be back! The food was authentic,  delicious and beautifully served.  The service was not fast but I expected that from the previous YELP reviews. However it is all homemade and worth every minute. I would rather wait for great food than get served mediocre food quickly,  I already did my time time eating in the military..."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food not like other restaurants that claim to sell Mexican food.   La mejor comida mexicana y autentica la venden aqui mmmm yummy love tacos dorados!   Aqui si sabe a Mexico!"}
{"text":"So, I've enjoyed Mi Cocina before.... but I think my tastes have matured.  The salsa was good, but the sauce inside of my taco and chimichanga was a strange ketchup/bbq tasting mixture.  Beans were ok, rice, not so much.  I probably won't be back.  Sorry Mi Cocina."}
{"text":"Amazing homestyle mexican tradition food from the birria to the chilaquiles. It's a must if you haven't gone."}
{"text":"The service was great as soon as me and my family walked in. Great overall vibes. We ordered sushi which took a bit longer than the other food but I did not mind one bit. The food was delicious. The gentleman who took our order was super attentive and had amazing customer service. Also very informative for this being our first time!I would definitely come back and recommend anyone to come!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food and the sushi reminds me of the sushi my aunt makes in sinaloa. I really feel I'm at home. Really good food and fun for the kids. You have to visit this place, it's a must. Service and overall experience."}
{"text":"Great Margaritas.  But it's hard to review a mexican restaurant that's as good as the next.  I still wish there was a TRULY good mexican restaurant in Madison...  Still waiting.  And don't come tell me ... um... the one on Park.. what's that name???  ....  La Hacienda.  I'd rather poke my eye out or eat at La Bambas...."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and affordable. The beans have the additional flavor of chorizo and cheese. The chips are small and easy to pop in your mouth. The enchiladas are full of flavor. Not easy to see from the street but worth finding."}
{"text":"OMG:  It's the beginning of the end for us telling everyone about this place, but omg: It is hard to find, but sooo worth the drive. Family is awesome. Food is awesome. We may have to end up waiting in line soon, but this place is worth it. Fans of the old La Guadalupana on 16th St & Oak will swoon.  Oh yeah:  TUESDAYS: Caldo! WEEKENDS: Menudo!!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is very high quality. Always bring my friends in and we always leave very satisfied! Great prices!"}
{"text":"Never ever will my family and eat here again! Just walked out after waiting for over a  hour for my food. Mind you my Husband and Daughters received their food but Mom sat there waiting for hers which never came. When we walked out the cashier had the nerve to tell my Husband it was finally ready and if we would like to take it home. My Husband kindly explained we went out to eat, to eat out not take out. I dont need anyone to pay for my food but they could have taken the drinks off for the inconvenience but nothing just an I'm sorry with an eye roll. Horrible customer service and such a disappointment. If you want to waste your time and hope to get full chips then this is your place....my name is Denise and this is my Husband's account."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and no complaints the food is really authentic and coming from a home where my grandma made food to order like a restaurant these flavors take me back to growing up only downfall it's a little bit pricey but I'll keep coming back definitely recommend to those who know what REAL Mexican food is!"}
