{"text":"What a gem we located in the Shopper's strip mall. Service was warm, friendly and very courteous. Food was very well presented and simply delicious! Lots of food for the value. Fresh sushi. We also received items on the house which was a very nice touch. 

We had originally gone to another location but glad it did not work out there and ended up here. Have gone three times to date. Service and food have been consistent... wonderful!!! We will most definitely be back! Thanks"}
{"text":"I've been here with my family for dinner, and the staff there is so friendly and accommodating. Every time I've been, it's been packed- which is a good sign. The food has always been fresh and the prices are decent. I prefer sitting in the booths rather than the tables in the middle due to lack of space and privacy. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant and will be returning."}
{"text":"The best sushi I have ever tried so far. For such a long time, MiNe sushi was my best chiice when we deciced to go for sushi. However, this place is surprisingly good. Foods are always fresh, the staff are super friendly. 
The price is very reasonable for the portion of the food you get.They always bring complimentary salad and 2 kinds of soup ( noodle and misou) while u are waiting for the main dish and fresh fruits after u r done. 
The owner is such a nice lady who accompanies you to the door when you are leaving the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great quality sushi and teriyaki for reasonable price. Service was fantastic and the staff went out of their way to get us utensils or extra orders. Will definitely be going back and becoming our new sushi joint in the Hill."}
{"text":"Visited here during off-peak time. The food here is pretty pricy comparing to other options available in Markham or Richmond Hill.

I asked for Seafood Udon but they served me Chicken Udon instead. The udon was okay lacked flavour. We also ordered a love boat, some of the sashimi was okay, but some were super fishy and not very fresh. 

The decorations are pretty old and rusty too, from the outside the restaurant looked like its a fast food place.

The waitress was very nice and friendly. We were in a rush and she helped us to make the food come faster."}
{"text":"We came here last night or the first time on my birthday. Wow is this place ever something, we came in as first time visitors and left feeling like we have been long-time customers. The food was delicious and we got combination dishes to share as a family of four: sushi and ramen, and sushi and tempura. When the food arrived, I couldn't believe it was just one order. There was so much food!!! The prices were about $22-$22 per combo too which was really good considering how much they gave us. We checked the bill to make sure they didn't give us two orders, but sure enough it was 1 each.  The sushi was fresh and all dishes were delicious. We ordered typical sides like gyoza, edamame and yakitori.  All were great!

This is our new go-to sushi place. We even received parting gifts too after dinner in celebration of their one year anniversary. Congratulations on the one year and I hope they have many more successful years to come! Very few places treat their customers the way this place did. Such warm hospitality, like coming into a friend's home. I can't recommend them enough. Our usual places have been Tomo and Mi-Ne in the area, but you get far more value, attention, and great food here at Sushi Aoi!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite Japanese restaurant. One of the best! Their sushi and sashimi are fresh and prepared perfectly!  Excellent value, excellent service! I will definitely come back again and again."}
{"text":"Really lovely atmosphere and service. Food is standard but very good portions. Definitely will come here again."}
{"text":"I had a great time at this restaurant. The food was excellent and I think the prices are fair regarding the amount that you get. The decor is very nice and comfortable. The staff are extremely welcoming and accommodating. Overall good experience and will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Well the yelp reviewers were right on the money, once again.  Amazing how reliable you guys / gals are. Friends of ours mentioned this place as the highest rated sushi place in Richmond Hill / York Region North and East and they were absolutely right, & by they I mean the tons of people before me who have reviewed this restaurant with stellar comments and very interesting and intriguing highlights.  Suffice it to say we will start making this our regular place, our weekly sushi outing, moving aside all the other ones we used to frequent like the close-by Mine, Hwy 7's Miyabi, Haru, etc., etc., because we always go where the fish is freshest and the service the kindest and that's what we're guaranteed to get here....
Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"It's impressive cheap at the portion you get. Although it doesn't feel authentic Japanese food, if you looking for authentic sushi and sashimi,this is not for you. But there service and value is good."}
{"text":"Amazing service, and rolls were delicious :) I am excited to return and try even more things on their menu."}
{"text":"Great Sushi and Great Service! We definitely prefer it over MiNe for both quality and Service. Their tuna hand roll is the best we have ever had!

A must try!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best sushi place in GTA. For affordability, presentation, quality, and service.  Believe me, as growing up in Markham, and frequenting the city for school, I have been to countless sushi places of all types. This one was exceptional. You must go. You will find absolutely nothing to complain about. Hands down a great experience."}
{"text":"Quality sushi and I mean that where the the price point of their lunch menu and the quality/quantity of their bento box or sushi set is on point. Their customer service is quite good as they employ a ringer system where you press and notify the waiter/waitress. The food came out quick although it would have been better if the three sets of meals we ordered came out at once ;) the katsu came probably 15 minutes after the initial sushi bento box."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese gem within the area! Excellent service, food and so clean. It's so hard to find a good sushi restaurant in this specific area. The sushi is so fresh here and you can definitely taste it. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I have to say how amazed I'm with the service at this place. Especially for a sushi place this is beyond average. It seems that the owner herself is serving and working there all the time. She makes sure that you are happy and I feel like I came to someone's home for dinner. Just a warm and inviting experience. Have been there twice. 
Sushi a great! Wonderful quality and variety priced really well. They also give a lot of complimentary stuff like dumpling and soup. I don't think I will go to another sushi in my area any more. This place is the best example of customer service."}
{"text":"Was in Richmond Hill and looking for a good sushi place to try. Stumbled upon this place. Staff were super friendly and good service. Food was fresh and tasty. The first time I went here we dined in. Had own little booth which was nice. It was as packed when I was there but that change fairly quickly as the restaurant started to fill up. Two other times I ordered take out and I think it was the manager that took down my order and when I came to pick it up she made sure to go through the items with me to ensure I had everything. There was one time where I had asked for no cucumber in the maki roll but the chef made a mistake and I was OK with just poking it out myself but she made sure a new order was made quickly and both her and the chef apologized for the mistake which was very nice of them. Would definately come back."}
{"text":"There's a new King of Sushi in Richmond Hill..  and this coming from a sushi/sashimi foodie who has tried from all over.

Most RH natives know Mi-Ne (just a couple of blocks north) has ruled for almost a decade, even spawning a couple of franchises. That may have been its downfall as it has now been eclipsed by this new and still hidden gem that arguably puts many upscale Toronto sushi places to shame.

Very pleasantly surprised as the previous sushi place in the same location was sadly, garden variety. 

Make no mistake though. Sushi Aoi could not be any further from that, sporting exotic maki and croquette creations we have not seen anywhere else. Texture, flavour and freshness are unsurpassed. The proportion of ingredients, especially that between fish and rice combine to make this as delectable and carb-guilt-free sushi experience as you will find in the GTA.

Service cannot be more personal, as chef, owner and waitress pamper--giving you surprise glimpses of the restaurant's yet unnamed delicacies. 

Naturally don't take this review for its word. Go see for yourself. This is our family's third visit in as many weeks. Each time gets better than the last."}
{"text":"5 stars  for everything! Very clean, very friendly and very fresh. I was very pleased by their super nice service and amazing food. I would definitely recommend this place to you."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Good portions. The sashimi is fresh and sushi was tasty. Clean restaurant. I enjoyed it better than MiNe. The spring rolls were fresh; I think they were hand made."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly staff, reasonable price, clean bathroom, hidden gem in Richmond hill, will definitely come again"}
{"text":"A high contender for great sushi houses up north. Well worth the drive.

Food 5/5
Service 5/5
Atmosphere 5/5

Cozy wooden booths and properly segregated seating gave customers the privacy of intimate meals and a call button to make sure no table goes ignored. Lunch time offers an array of combos guarantee to fill your stomach with an affordable price. However, being first time customers we thought we'd explore their menu.

Our meal began with complementary side salad and bonus soba noodle soup in place of miso soup! The broth was a great clean tasting shoyu with a good sample of silky soba noodles.

Next came our lunch discounted shrimp tempura appetizer. Fantastic! The batter was so light and extremely crispy letting the shrimp flavour be distinct rather than overwhelmed. The dipping sauce was sweeter than other tempura sauce I've had in the past but the marriage was incredible! Definitely some of the best tempura I've enjoyed in my sushi eating experience.

Our main course Love Boat B arrive with a gracious sampling of their Torched California Roll complementary from the chef! The smokiness from torching the sauce gave the California roll a new identity. It was delicious and even more so because it was free! The boat had great variety with generous cuts of sashimi and well proportioned fish to rice ratio in the nigiris.

Lastly the arrival of the AOI udon soup joined our feast. The broth tasted the same as the complementary soba we began with. No complaints here. Submersed with the smooth bouncy udon were bits of scallop, muscle, shrimp, tempura bits, vegetables and crab sticks. This would've been considered a seafood udon at other places but you get all the above in the cheapest udon selection on the menu!

Our server always had a smile on and checked in on us often. She was quick, charming and was well versed in explaining items on the menu and their special promotions. Granted we ordered a lot of food for just two people and the bill totaled to $70, it was well worth the wonderful experience with pro-bono offerings and a second portion of high quality sushi to go. We will definitely return and recommend anyone who is in the Richmond Hill area to pay them a visit. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The service was incredible - we got complimentary mini salad, miso soup, and a small bowl of noodles! And we ordered the ebi shrimp sashimi, which original comes with 3 pieces, but they gave us 4 so that me and my friend could have 2 each! AND they gave us free gyozas as well! The chef's tasting sashimi platter was really fresh and the Orangeville roll was sooo yummy. Definitely will be back and recommend to anyone in the area!"}
{"text":"Service was good, Seafood soup ($10) was decent, but definitely not worth the price for the size (small). Wakame salad was pretty good ($6). Ika Sashimi (squid) did not taste fresh and was nothing special at all compare to other sushi places."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for sushi, very fresh and quality fish, large portion sizes. Side dishes are excellent as well, tasty and complements the main course.

The lunch menu has good variety and priced well for the quality and amount of food. The sashimi lunch and sushi/maki boxes are beautifully presented so it's as appealing to your eyes as well as your mouth. 

The pictures speak for themselves"}
{"text":"Great sushi and sashimi at very reasonable prices.  Sashimi Dinner with a couple of bowls of sushi rice (small upcharge, but usually waived) is just right.  Kalbi Appetizer is also a an extraordinarily good deal. Usually get a private booths and staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"My girlfriend wanted to try sushi for the first time so I wanted to find a place with good quality and atmosphere. Thankfully for us, we have apps like Yelp that can lead us to the right direction. That direction just so happened to lead us here to Sushi Aoi or Sushi Artificially Obnoxious Intelligence as I lovingly called it. We sat in a cozy booth, perfect for a romantic occasion and we picked our dish. A small 36 piece plate that we split. The selection was nice, displayed on a lovely wooden ship; California roll, shrimp, salmon, tuna, squid, egg and spicy crunchy tuna roll. It was all very good and quite filling. Seeing my girlfriend's face after eating raw ginger was the cherry on top. The servers were very nice and even gave my girlfriend a free refill just because they thought we were so cute together. Cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This five stars is because the waiter is really really handsomeAnd i would like to suggest the Orangeville Roll?should be enough for a adult?and the souce is very nice. The sashimi is also fabulous tasty and goodlooking.Not a big fan of theUnagi Don, too salty for me.Overall it is a great dinner experience?"}
{"text":"I have come to this location 2 separate times, the first time we sat in for 30 minutes for them to tell us it would take a long time for them to make us anything as the previous party has ordered a lot. 2nd Time I was turned away at the door at 9:40 PM with \"we close at 10:30 today\"."}
{"text":"I had lunch special, 6 piece nigiri sushi and 6 piece salmon maki. I was afraid the food was not enough for me, but it came with some complimentary salad, noodle, miso soup and spring rolls, I could not finish the food I ordered in the end."}
{"text":"The owners are Korean and they are extremely nice. Customer service is superb. They gave us a complimentary dish of 2 spring rolls. The food was good and tasted fresh. Wished they had all you can eat.

Women's bathroom is very clean, and shocked to see how they have a shelf of women products (e.g. pads, tampons...) - that is nice!"}
{"text":"Their sushi is very good and clean. They are not all you can eat anymore. But their sushi is worth it and really delicious. Their yam roll is one of the best I've ever had. I pretty much tried everything off the menu ..sit down and delivery. They dont disappoint."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! We experienced the best customer service the second we walked in the door. The food was incredible, the atmosphere was great and the price was right. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here and wasn't expecting much because of the plaza that it was located in. However, it was a place that we never tried before and decided to give it a chance. It caught us by surprise of how great their service was.

Staff was super welcoming and friendly. They were attentive to our needs.

Food was authentic and they also gave us a sushi roll on the house. 

Overall, it was a great experience and we will come back."}
{"text":"Well I must say I was totally pleasantly surprised by this place. I am very loyal to a few of the local places and had passed by this one a million times and never had the inclination to go in. I happened to read the reviews when I was in a time crunch and needed something quick and close and I was impressed with the reviews.  This place has one of the best noodle crunch soup I have ever had. Yun was our server and was generous, kind and was honestly glad to serve us offering us some free appetizers and showed his appreciation of us giving him business. 
I had the chirashi which was beautiful fresh and the rice was perfectly done. My dinner companion had the terryaki chicken dinner which was tender and a very generous portion. Unfortunately they forgot about the order of California rolls so cannot speak to that and mistakes happen.  
The prices are average on some things and a little pricey on others   
Overall I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place, I go on my lunch break, very friendly and great food at a good price."}
{"text":"I'll start it off with excellent service. Food quality was not great and the slices were too thick. Probably wouldn't be back. Although the environment inside the restaurant was quite nice."}
{"text":"Damn Sushi Aoi - you're better than a 3-star A-oi-K (get it?), rather in one visit you've made me ever more than a 4-star fan. I'm going as far as to say that this is a 4.5 sushi experience in a Richmond Hill plaza that on it's best day isn't more than a 2-star sketchy plaza. Never mind, before submitting I realized that they deserve my 5th star just based on customer service along

The prior sushi resto here had a bad rep and terrible food, so I had written off any sushi establishment in the plaza. However, when planning for a lunch meeting today I whipped open my Yelp app and saw Sushi Aoi boasting a healthy number of reviews and a near perfect star-average - awesome, let's go. When GPS pointed me to the Value Village plaza (aka 2-star sketchy) I was shocked.

It's a beautiful a la carte spot inside, with a lovely mix of booths, tables and even private booths with curtains you can pull close. The team here is Korean (as is the trend with many 905-sushi spots) but they've more than mastered the Japanese art of sushi and exceptional customer service.

For lunch, I went with Sushi Lunch Combo F and Lunch Roll Set F (shared with my DC). Lunch was preceded by a salad and two kinds of soup (one with a knot of noodles and the other a Miso soup standard) both excellent. The sushi and rolls were incredible, with fair portions of fish to rice ratio (not an excessive amount of rice) and the rolls were large and filled with equally fresh ingredients.

The service here was on a whole other level. Frequent tea and water top-ups, most times long before I could get beyond a 1/2 glass drank. The chef not once but twice sent over complimentary samples for us to try. At the beginning of the meal he sent over two fried veggie spring rolls, and once we were well into our mains he sent over a torched sushi roll for us to try and give him feedback on - excellent and totally unexpected.

I wish I could say that working for Yelp afforded me these sorts of opportunities more often but I tend to dine incognito so I was amazed to be treated so special as a regular customer. Much appreciated!

Looking forward to coming back

{"text":"I loved their rolls, I got delivery and I wasn't sure what to expect. Large and yummy rolls. Although they were a little more expensive than other places I've ordered from, I was pleased."}
{"text":"Came here a while back, but since I want to expand my Yelp resume, gotta write them reviews! 

Lunch Specials ftw!
Gotta say though, when we came in (Saturday 12:30ish) it was EMPTY. At least we were greeted by a VERY happy server. Seated on the window side facing the parking lot was comfortable. They had little cushions there too. The waitress then arrived with the green tea (which was fantastic) and the menu. 

Ordered the Salmon Bento as well as the Sashimi Bento.  Service was quick (better be if we are the only ones :P) and we got the miso soup as well as a small little cup/bowl of noodles. Tasted good like it should be. Then the boxes came. Salad portion was nice, they put it in the box instead of a little bowl. Tasted fresh (not as good as Haru but the portion makes up for it somewhat). Salmon was great, bold taste but the sashimi was not too good. It was really soft and mushy for some reason. The 3 rolls were decent, nothing else to say about em. 

Star of the show was definitely the complimentary spring rolls and the complimentary spicy salmon hand rolls! Free tastes better? Yep pretty much. 

Overall pretty good when considering the service. Food was decent. Price is standard for lunch. Will return to try some other things!"}
{"text":"I came here last weekend and had an ok experience. The food was presented beautifully and the sashimi was really fresh. The only problem was how cold the restaurant was. We were seated next to the window and it was freezing. The ventilation was poor and I had to put my gloves on to keep my hands warm.  When we walked out of the restaurant, the cold air outside was warmer than where we were sitting. 

Now onto the food!
We ordered the small sashimi platter and it was very filling. It was more than enough food for two people. Most of the fish melted in our mouths and I was happy with the order. We also ordered rice, salads and soup. Since I'm gluten intolerant, the waitress was kind enough to bring me a complementary order of edamame since I was unable to eat the soup and salad. 

The service!
The service was really great. Our waitress always refilled our teacups and was very attentive. Ideally I would have given this restaurant 4 stars but due to the frigid air I had to lower the rating to three stars. 

I do believe other tables within the restaurant might be warmer. For example, the rest room area was very warm. Unfortunately that's not the part of the restaurant that needs to be warm."}
{"text":"This place is as delightful as the Yelpers before me contend! Service is beyond extraordinary. The owner (I believe?) is a very friendly lady who takes the time to come by your table on multiple occasions during your stay, often bringing the complimentary items which have heretofore been mentioned by others (spring rolls, spicy salmon hand rolls) or simply to check-in on you. :) I came with my family for my birthday dinner a few weeks back and between the four of us we ordered Maki Set C (9 dynamite rolls + 9 spider rolls, if memory serves), a tempura dinner and the futomaki roll. At first we were concerned that we hadn't ordered enough but between the two soups, salad, spring rolls, hand rolls each of us had in addition to what we'd ordered we ended up having quite a bit to take home. What is really nice about this place is the attention to detail - I won't give away too much, but a celery stick (?) shaped like a dragon was a highlight of the night :D The place itself is quite nice and cozy inside (with pillows in the booths!) :) Quality of the food is excellent.
It is a little on the pricey side but altogether, a great experience! Tip: 20% off the menu (minus lunch specials, I think) is offered during certain times (as of this writing there is no website to confirm, but I think it's weekdays 1-4pm). Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. An additional bonus to their great food would be they gave a lot of complimentary items and their food was pretty good too! Definitely coming back! Interior is super cute too!"}
{"text":"great experience?nice choice for lunch and afternoon meal?lunch special is about $10-18 and they have 10-20% off between3-5pm? will come again"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, sometimes they give you extra dishes for free!! The waiter was extremely nice and sociable. Tables and chairs were relatively clean and they're located in a great place!"}
{"text":"I've been an avid Yelp user for years, and I've never felt the need to leave a review until Sushi Aoi. I wish I could give this place 6 stars- the food was delicious, with huge portion and fresh ingredients. We had the volcano roll and Aoi sushi combo. The volcano roll is pretty cool here, they actually set it on fire. Somehow the rum that the fire burns on soaked into one of our sushi pieces, but Yun our server was quick to replace it with a complimentary roll. The Aoi sushi combo was fantastic and well portioned.

It's the service that sets this place apart. On the three occasions I've been here the servers have all been extremely gracious and considerate. Throughout our meal, we would get tons of complimentary dishes. At the end of our meal today, Yun our server took the time to introduce himself to us and offer us complimentary dishes. Fantastic people run this restaurant and make fantastic food."}
{"text":"I was very delighted with my experience here. 
I came right at opening (11:30am) last Sunday morning and the restaurant was tidy and quiet. I was seated at one of the curtained booths by the windows, which provided me with a more \"private VIP\" environment and worked in my favour for photo-taking since I was able to capture all the natural light. 

My boyfriend and I, who are massive sushi lovers and also massive eaters, we ordered a \"I love salmon\" combo, sushi lunch combo D, AND a torched golden dragon roll. Everything was so delicious that we ate all of it and as a result, was super stuffed by the end. This isn't to say that there wasn't enough food in each of the orders though - oh no, their portion sizes were FAIRLY generous and would easily fill up a regular appetite (we're just gluttons)!

From the maki to the sushi to the sashimi, everything was top notch fresh and good quality cuts. While the prices weren't cheap, I would like to have you wager that for the same cost, the alternative is a loud, potentially messy,  all-you-can-eat restaurant with more variety but reduced quality. So whether this place is worth it really just depends on what you're in the mood for! I'm more of an all-you-can-eat kinda gal myself.. but I can appreciate those who prefer a la carte experiences!"}
{"text":"This place is the BEST!
This is my favorite sushi place. 
Everyone has to go to this place and eat.
They give free soup while you wait for your food and extras always. And the food is without doubt excellent."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant from yelp so decided to give it a try after work. I Ordered take out from this restaurant and got the chirashi sushi.

Food - 2.5 to 3 stars max. Which is based only on the chirashi sushi because that's the only item I ordered. Typical quality of fish, it's nothing really stands out but it's not bad either, average. Similar to the quality you will get from the MI-NE restaurant abit north from here. But that restaurant can be packed at times so this restaurant would a good alternative as well if MI-NE is super busy. ;) Coming back to the chirashi, it does have variety including scallop. It even comes with ponzu sauce if you want abit of tangy flavour in your food. I don't use much of it but I am sure someone will like it.  :)

Service- in terms of service, they gave me a feeling that they want to provide good services and to make sure that I am happy when leaving the restaurant. I do appreciate their effort. For example, since it took some time to prepare for my order, they want to make sure I am comfy by provide me with some tea and then a hand roll 5 min later. When I get my order, they also gave me a free order of fried spring roll. It's not a lot in money value but it's their sincereness and thoughts that matters to me.. extra star from me for this. Hopefully they can keep up this kind of philosophy by valuing every customer that comes in."}
{"text":"We ordered the small combo platter for 2 people and it comes with a loooooot of food. It came with a lot of appetizers - soup, salad, spring rolls and noodles which all tasted pretty standard. 

Most of the sashimi was thick cut and fresh, they even had scallop sashimi in the platter. However, some slices of butter fish was still frozen and was not defrosted yet.... 
The sushi was good... the sashimi slices were fresh but it did not stick on to the rice and fell off. I was not a fan of the spicy salmon roll, the texture was too mushy for me. 
Their rolls are large and the tempura was crispy. I really liked the roll, the sauce complemented the maki roll very well. 

Fast and friendly service, since it wasn't busy when I went. Quality is a little bit above average and portions are bigger than most. Acceptable sushi place to go to if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"THE TORCHED SUSHI IS AMAZING! I wasn't sure if the higher price was going to be worth it but it totally was!! Their rolls for lunch sets are also big portions. It's a snug restaurant with cozy booths, so the atmosphere is nice. I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"This is my second favorite sushi place after Mi Ne.
Everything was AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!
The sushi was on point!
Only thing was that the sushi was a bit soft so it kept falling (but honestly the soft sushi made it taste SO GOOD!!!)"}
{"text":"11/10!!!!! Would be definitely coming back here !! Sooo amazing. Gives complimary food and even when we were leaving they are so amazing !! So delicious the food 10/10"}
{"text":"2.5 stars total. 

This restaurant has been only opened for about 4 months, and the reviews made it looked promising. 

Our lunch venture brought us here for a try. The prices seemed quite reasonable $10 for the tonkatsu bento and $14 for the sushi combo B which included 9 pieces of sushi and 6 pieces of California rolls. 
We also ordered 1 order of agedashi tofu. 
Both lunch specials came with miso soup, salad and a cup of noodles in a light broth. 
On the house we were given veggie spring rolls and spicy salmon hand rolls. 
This gave us a good basic variety and the basics. 

Let's start at the beginning. 
Service - stellar! 1 star
Miso soup - water mixed with a lot of miso. Added to it was chopped green onions and chopped enoki mushroom ends. A bit salty. 
The pork in the tonkatsu was so thin the breading was just as thick on both sides. So you barely noticed there was any pork at all. 
The California rolls were loosely rolled but decent. 
Perhaps we were in on an off day as the sushi didn't look anything like the other photos and were nowhere near as fresh. The scallop looked cooked and when I bit into it, it did have the cooked texture until you got to the very bottom where you get the raw texture. 
The agedashi tofu was put in a tempura soya sauce making it very salty. The pieces of tofu were cut on the thin side, so after going through the fryer made the soft tofu \"old\" tougher. 
The 2nd food star goes to the noodles that came with the meal and the spicy salmon hand roll. 
The noodles and broth were very light and very refreshing, an excellent way to start a meal. 
The spicy salmon hand roll was also superb. Though there was more rice than filling, the chef include not only the mixed salmon, but cucumber slivers, black sesame and tobiko, giving it more texture and crunch. 
The last .5 goes the overall cleanliness of the restaurant and washroom. 

Will I be back, probably not. Too soon to tell as they have more time to improve."}
{"text":"Service was much quicker this time. 

Karage was very yum! Love the hot mustard it came with. 

Large Sashimi Boat was plentiful for 6! 

Tried a new Roll today: Snowball Roll. Not a huge fan of this one. I found it a little boring. 

Usual were really good: 
Love Me Roll 
Crazy Salmon Roll 
White Dragon Roll

They made sure to come around and ask how everything was, and also surprised us with Mackerel on the house!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants. They have a wide selection of foods, from bento boxes, sushi sets, rice bowls to ramen.  They give you free appetizer, which is spring rolls and a tiny portion of noodles in soup.   

Food: good
Service: excellent!
Cleanliness: super clean, even the bathroom.
Other comments: A minor problem - the table is too narrow and there is lot of space between the person and the table, so you have to lean forward to eat.  One time, we had a group of 7 people and we ordered a lot of food, there wasn't enough space."}
{"text":"This place is freaking amazing! It didn't look like much from the outside, but when we walked in, I was immediately blown away, and it did not stop there. First of all, the place is super clean and beautifully designed and arranged, and one of the employees who saw us first immediately greeted us kindly. The service was lovely although occasionally slightly delayed, but it was understandable since it started to get busy. Everything we ordered was fantastic in terms of taste, portions and timing for the arrival of each item. There were satisfying amounts of time between getting the spring rolls (complementary !), miso soup, salad, tempura, noodles (also complementary !!) and main dishes, so we always had enough space on the table and in our stomachs. And everything was beautiful ! Loved the plating. Very satisfyingly full n happy, this is definitely a must-go !"}
{"text":"I looove this restaurant. Amazing food and excellent service! I've been here a handful of times now and have never been disappointed. I enjoy trying out all of the different special rolls and getting some pieces of salmon sashimi on the side. So far, my favourite is definitely the Orangeville Roll or the Torched Rainbow Dragon Roll. This place also has a $10 deal for 10 pieces of sashimi, which is a pretty great deal and just enough to satisfy my raw fish cravings. 

Things are however a bit pricey considering how casual this place is, especially if you're just looking for a quick/inexpensive meal. But... if you're a sushi lover, then you'd know nothing is ever really all that cheap when it comes to this Japanese deliciousness. Definitely worth checking Sushi Aoi out!"}
{"text":"A breathe of fresh air!   This sushi place is new, clean and the food tastes very fresh.  They also provide complimentary salads and soups and even mini hand rolls when you order.  The server made sure we were full before we left.   We will be back for sure!!  


Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great place with fresh food and friendly service.  They really know how to take care of their customers.  We always tend to order toomuch because they offer a lot of complimentary diahes such as appetizers, salad, soup, noodles and something else like spring rolls, hand rolls or another small crunchy appetizers.

The fish is fresh and rolls are well seasoned or sauced so they give you a YUM! Feeling qhen you put it in your mouth.  They are aopreciate our patronage and have been back everytime we want Japanese."}
{"text":"Food quality remains good.  The reason for the drop from my previous five star rating is due speed of the service.  Maybe it's my timing or they are just getting too busy.  It took a while for the servers to clear up the many empty tables while we stood waiting for a table.  Once seated and ordered, we waited, waited, waited til the food finally came.   It took a long time for them to even get tea (after we reminded them); even the soup and salad took a long time...I understand if the kitchen is busy but the servers should at least put some food on the table.   Oh well.  I hope they improve the process since I do like this place and through it all, the servers were quite polite (but please improve the speed of not leaving the table completely empty)."}
{"text":"The outside of Sushi Aoi looked unassuming - it even gave off the impression that the food is probably not that great (along with inattentive staff members). I was pleasantly surprised that it was not the case. I came to Sushi Aoi on my birthday and I was blown away by how well prepared, well-presented and delicious all of the dishes were (especially the sushi pizza)! The staff were also very attentive and even offered free desserts and free extra dishes! I love the fact that they have private seating as well and had doorbells in the booths. Seriously - all restaurants should implement doorbells on their tables. On a side note, the bathrooms were super clean and the ladies' room even came with sanitary napkins and mouth wash (along with disposable cups). I'll definitely be coming back here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered two rolls thinking we should've ordered more but  while we waited for the food they kept giving us complimentary soup, salad, noodles, and spring rolls. It did take some time for the rolls to arrive but the focus was shifted to the complimentary stuff. The rolls are also big portions, little rice with lots of filling and toppings, they were delicious. We almost struggled to finish the rolls because they were so big.

Service was also great, when we arrived there was an open table by the door but because it gets cold there so the waitress asked us to sit there while a nearby booth was paying their bill so we can move there later."}
{"text":"I arrived here for dinner at 6 PM with my family and we waited until 7PM for our dishes to arrive. We ordered a Aoi Udon, Kamikaze roll, Golden Dragon roll, and Dynamite roll. We wait a ridiculous amount of time for the food, as they claimed they all of a sudden had \"phone orders\" however only 1 lady walked in for pick up during the hourr we waited (Yeah, I counted) and there were only 3 other tables occupied in the restaurant (all of which already had their food). 
Anyways, they try to compensate by giving out lots of appetizers, we got complementary spring rolls, crab salad hand rolls, salads, miso soups.... nothing we really wanted, but were given anyways. This seems to be their ploy hmmm....

The rolls finally came, and were large, but all were too cold(like out of the fridge level) and had weird sauces all over them... I think they put ranch and teriyaki sauce on the golden dragon roll.... The udon was good, but smaller in portion. 

Will not even consider coming back."}
{"text":"The sushi is great not too much rice and lots of gu. The rice may have had needed a bit more seasoning but I definitely would go back to try more of their food. 

I really loved the saba nigiri with roe, first I've ever had it that way and it was awesome!

The staff was very friendly and we received a complimentary roll."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Service can be slow if the place is busy. Generous portions unlike most sushi places. Tables are very spacious and private as all of them are booths. Tempuras were super crispy and but not overly cooked. Rolls were big and very filling. Generous slices of sashimi for nigiri. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Great dinner, ordered the combination small 33pcs including sashimi, sushi, and maki rolls. Awesome. The blonde hair Korean/Japanese waitress is actually really cute too :) Shout out to her~~~~ I gave her good tips :D The food is awesome, washroom is A++ clean. I would definitely recommend to everyone who pass by or live in Richmond hill who loves sushi and is tired of All you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"I DID NOT like this place and nor did anyone in my party.  All of the rolls were HUGE and not the typical size.  SO MUCH RICE...

Every roll also tasted the same-except for the ones that had cream cheese in them.  All the reviews made us want to try this place. Not sure what changed but will NOT REPEAT."}
{"text":"Me and my 2.5 year old daughter were visiting family in Richmond Hill, and her aunt and uncle wanted to try sushi for the first time. We Googled a lot of places and went to Sushi Aoi, because it had a lot of good reviews. What I will say is the staff are lovely, the ladies were polite and gave my daughter colouring tools without even being asked. Overall they were very friendly, but, we got food poisoning. We are still suffering now and we went on Friday evening. I know it is good poisoning because my daughter began to vomit two hours after getting back home, and I was in the bathroom a few hours after that. Me and her ate the most because her aunt and uncle didn't like it. The cooks maybe need to be a little more sanitary."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant with quality food and friendly service. 

Firstly, this place is VALUE (price relative to quality and quantity). 
We love to order the Combination meals because it comes with a Main (teriyaki meat or udon soup as examples), miso soup, salad, small noodle soup, rice, basket of tempura (2 shrimp + veggies), 3 california roll pieces and 3 nigiri.

The roll, I think it's called Lover's Roll?, is to die for. We really enjoyed this.

My only qualm the clumsy wording in their menu for Combination meals. It states that the combination meals come with soup, salad, and rice. However, when I ordered the combination with sushi and sashimi, it didn't come with rice... When asked about it, the waiter said that rice only comes with the teriyaki meals (surprising to me, because this meal came with quite a lot of sashimi to go with rice. Not a big deal, but something to note. We also ordered the udon noodle soup Combination, which came with a miso soup the first time we came, but the second time we came it didn't come with a soup... the server said that it's because the udon noodle soup is already soupy. Again, not a big deal, but they need to fix the wording in their menu because customers will be disappointed when they don't receive what is listed in the menu.

Anyway, the restaurant is great overall. Get a Combination meal and share a fancy roll and you'll be happy.

Lots of parking in the parking lot."}
{"text":"It's a lot like Mi Ne sushi! We asked the staff there if they were related but we're not sure if they understood us. The rolls are huge and very filling. There's something called \"Aoi Time\" where they have 10% off sashimi and 20% off everything else from 3-5pm.... but we were there for dinner. 

We had the Chef special ($29) which I find is a great deal- 2 lobster tempura, 2 shrimp tempura, 7pc sushi/maki, 12pc sashimi, and a teriyaki rice as well- easily shared between two people and maybe add a roll. 

Also had the polar bear $14 and Orangeville roll $15 (which are the same as Mi Ne?) 

We got complimentary gyozas and a small soup noodle on top of the miso soup as well, which was nice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and was met with a very friendly greeting. That always appeals to me and set the mood for a nice lunch encounter.

The food was fresh and good, above average for a city full of Japanese/Korean/Chinese/Asian restaurants. The service was as friendly as our initial greeting and the restaurant including the bathrooms were very clean.

We ordered the salmon teriyaki box and the seafood soup. The salmon was perfectly cooked and not a bit dry, well worth it especially on the lunch special. The seafood soup was good, but a small portion, at least when compared to the salmon box

Nice touches were the complimentary crunchy noodle soup to start with and the complimentary mini spring rolls with the meal.

I'll be back and next time I will try some Sushi and Sashimi."}
{"text":"This place is a gem, a little place in the middle of a dingy plaza. Super friendly staff and gave us free appetizers each time. Food portions are big and their lunch combos are the best value. My kids love this place. It has several booths as well as tables. Newly renovated and clean."}
{"text":"For their 100th review, I'm glad to give this place 5 stars. Was pretty satisfied with their food and service. Even though I wasn't that hungry for a bento box meal (this is dinner btw), we ordered a sushi platter, and salmon sashimi appetizers for two. Sushi was stuffed well and on top of that they gave us both complimentary soup and salad on the house! Just when we were stuffed and about to get the bill, they bring fruits (oranges). Can't end a meal without fruits :) I have no idea how we managed to finish all the food. 


Also, had to add as I glimpsed at one of the tips. They really do keep the washrooms nice and tidy with mouthwash if you really wanted to use some."}
{"text":"This place is clean and neat.  It has a few enclosed booths and some opened booths in the central area.  Some of the enclosed booths are overlooking the street.  Top-notch service; the owner always welcome us with a cheerful smile, and she will check on us throughout the meal.  I'm always impressed by the freshness and presentation of the food.  The owner surprises us with complimentary dishes everytime; somen noodles, spring roll, gyoza and even hand roll.  I'm always happy and full leaving this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing service!! The \"manager\" along with everyone else are so nice and friendly. Clean and nice atmosphere.The sushi is pretty good and fresh! Prices are like anywhere else in richmond hill so not too bad. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow, but considering this was a new restaurant and there was only one waitress to look after the whole restaurant, we waited politely without hurrying her. To our surprise, our patience was kindly rewarded with a grandiose amount of complimentary items.

We ordered the Chef Special that came with the usual soup and salad...

7 pcs sushi
Were super fresh and not too chilled. Each slice of sashimi was thickly cut and placed delicately on top of a small amount of sushi rice--unlike other establishments where you receive a pathetically thin piece of overly refrigerated fish atop a fist-size amount of rice. Texture of the fish had a nice crisp on each bite. 

Maki roll
Nothing too crazy about the roll, just that the cucumbers were thinly sliced instead of a large stick that's usually served in low-grade sushi restaurants. Again, not too much rice which was a plus.

Potato Croquette (Complimentary)
This was super delicious! Not drenched in oil with the right amount of moisture in the potatoes. Super good! 

Crab Handroll (Complimentary)
It was good, but nothing too comment worthy. Was very nice of the restaurant, though.

12 pc sashimi
Super delicious; again, same freshness as the sushi. It came with a rarely served mackerel roe sashimi that's not usually served in a mid-range priced Japanese restaurant. Although there was some kind of mix up, we were given a couple more sushi after and was told by the waitress that she was sorry for the extended wait, and the extras were on the house...sooooo nice!

Lobster Tempura
It was nice and tender and not dried. Nothing extraordinary but still good nonetheless.

Beef Teriyaki
Didn't have any of it, but my friend said it was not bad. Unfortunately in the end it went to spoil--too full.

The bill came up to $32.77 after tax but before tips. We tipped more because we felt the waitress was super nice and gave us lots of free dishes for the wait. We ended up with more than we paid for. 

Highly recommend this new restaurant, and do kindly excuse the wait if you do. They are still relatively new. 

Thank you, Sushi Aoi for your great service and delicious food. We shall return to try other items next time :)"}
{"text":"Agreed with other Yelpers, good restaurant and very similar to Mine. Everything was fresh and tasted great! And YES the rolls are huge!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and delicious food. Staffs were super friendly. Place was clean. Food was amazing and fresh. Also gave us a lot of complimentary dishes! One of the best sushi places that I've been to. Will return again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I really wanted to like this place based on all the stellar reviews but unfortunately have to leave dissapointed.

We came here on a Thursday night at about 6pm and ordered the \"love boat\".

This came with a salad that was obviously sitting in a fridge for a while. The cucumbers inside the salad were quite obviously left over from when they shave the outside of cucumbers to make rolls, as it was just thr circular core of the cucumber. There was miso soup and also another small soup with some sort of noodle.

The boat came out and I think it was over sized for the amount of food that sat on top.

They had a plastic tree in it as decor, but I find that useless.

There was a significant amount of escolar (wax fish - if you don't know what this is please google), odd colored salmon and a small amount of \"special\" sashimi (really just one shrimp?)

Most of the sushi pieces had a smearing of mayo, makes me wonder what are they trying to hide, as mayo on nearly every piece of sushi is just weird.

The rice in the sushi pieces were all irregularly shaped. Almost as if they grabbed random handfuls and squished it down. Seemed very amateur as i can make similar sushi rice at home, and that's not saying a lot.

Sushi rice was overly sweet and squished, sign of to much vinegar, and too much mixing as i could barely make out the grains.

Every piece was pretty irregular in shape and size. 

In not saying every piece has to be perfect, but at least try to be consistent in your dish served. Some places like it smaller, some places bigger. I haven't seen mismatched salmon sushi pieces before...

Sashimi pieces were all cut irregularly and also quite a few looked \"discolored\" possibly because they squished a lemon slice on top. The acidity perhaps cooked it.

Wasabi was weak and powdery - possibly low grade or expired?

Tea was very watered down.....

They did give us 4 spring rolls \"on the house\". The servers were very very nice, sadly their sushi chef isn't up to par...

3 stars for service, 2 stars for sushi.

For what we paid could have easily gone elsewhere more satisfying"}
{"text":"Presentation for one of the platters wasn't particularly good, but I'm not one to care about those things.

Service came quickly. The waiters and staff are quite friendly.

The food isn't anything to call home about, but that's not to say that it's bad, just good.

We got a complimentary dumpling dish and orange after our meal.

8.5/10"}
{"text":"Their fish is super fresh and good! Ordered a nigiri sushi combo, veggie tempura, chicken teriyaki, and spicy salmon rolls. All was delicious! I would advise avoiding 8pm as it's super busy at that time, but other than that a great experience. Came with miso soup, noodle soup, and spring rolls on the house! Great experience."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Richmond Hill.  The best sushi rolls I have ever tasted, juicy, lots lots of fillings, you will feel so refreshed after you eat those super big, super yummy sushi rolls. We are going back again this weekend. Thank you for the great food and great service!"}
{"text":"I love the chef special. My little brother can't stop saying we need to go back for that soon. We will. Soon."}
{"text":"This place is soooooo amazing! I went here for the first time with my dad today. Their portions of fish on nigiri are huge and the servers are the sweetest people ever. The food was fresh and delicious. It was our first time here so the server gave us 2 things on the house (spring rolls before our meal and 2 hand rolls after our meal). Their combo plate even had scallop which was nice. And it came with 2 different types of salmon. The server even walked us out to the door at the end of the evening. I will definitely come back and tell all my friends about it."}
{"text":"We are Sushi eaters at least 2 or 3 times per week. Have tried many others in the area.
Lets start off with soup - the noodle crunch soup.
The broth is clean and tasty the noodles are cooked just so.
I had the chicken teriyaki - a very generous protion of chicken breast perfectly char grilled, the vegetables below staying crisy and hot throughout the entire meal.
My girl friends dish was exquisitely crafted and o so fresh.
It was a true dining experience.
We shall definitely be returning guests."}
{"text":"Never doing all you can eat again. The freshness and size of the sushi is incredible. 

Minimal rice so you can taste the fish, they do not try to fill you  up on rice.

Free apps to the table just for eating there, cant beat that. The shashimi is also amazing with torched tuna and salmon. Very fresh and very large rolls with minimal rice, what more can you ask for. Oh and the lady who serves is awesome even walks you out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Well priced but we came at 3-5pm when they had discounts on the food - seemed to also reflect the quality of it because some of our sashimi was a bit fishy! Service was friendly, the atmosphere was very cute as well. Otherwise it was really well priced, but given the quality we would've been willing to pay more to compensate. Not sure if I would try it again."}
{"text":"I never thought a Richmond Hill sushi place could compete with nearby MiNe Sushi, but then along came Sushi AOI! The fish is so fresh, and the rice is the perfect amount of vinegary and chewy. Plus their signature rolls are creative and delicious! Even better, the price is really reasonable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner tonight after reading some of the reviews and they didn't disappoint. We ordered a small combination platter for 3 people (don't judge ) and the pieces were all good sized - no paper thin sashimi here. They also gave us 3 freebie dishes which was a very nice touch. Service was nice too. Very courteous and polite. We will come back again."}
{"text":"Honestly the freshest sushi I've ever had and at a decent price. The people that work here have the best customer service even when ordering takeout. I will definitely be a repeat customer. 
They are so nice when your eating for takeout, for a hand roll to try while I was waiting as well as some hot tea to warm me up. The older women here is so pleasant, she even walks you out the door and holds it for you as you are exiting. 
And be warned!!  The size of the rolls are huge, the portions are massive!"}
{"text":"Relatively new store so there are a lot of freebies. Run by korean staff so make sure to speak some korean to get a better experience. All i knew was how to say thank you in korean. 
Very big portions for a sushi resturant. 
Around the same price as most sushi places.

Staff are friendly, food was good, atmosphere felt authentic enough for a korean japanese resturant. 5 star worthy."}
{"text":"Clean facilities,  excellent food,  good portions and amazing service with gracious hostesses. Will definitely return. 

Location used to be an ichiban sushi restaurant.  That was horrible.  Very glad Aoi sushi replaced that one."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 3 times in the past month. Seriously the best sushi restaurant in northern Richmond Hill. Fish is always fresh, food is always on point, and the staff are always so polite. They also offer a few items on the house to ensure that you are full when leaving the restaurant. No complaints. I am already thinking about my 4th visit."}
{"text":"Decent food and quick service. Sushi Aoi will leave you wanting to come back the very next day. There are many courses but even for someone like me ( who eats like a bird), it wasn't overwhelming. However I would suggest a light lunch before this place. This is a MUST go sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"A very nice and cozy service. Excellent and hospitable service. Great for family dinners or with friends. The salmon teriyaki was grilled to perfection. Very generous portion and reasonably priced. One of the better Japanese food selections in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this 6 stars! 

Sushi Aoi is a fairly new sushi/Japanese restaurant in the value village/Shopper's drug mart plaza. There is lots of parking out front in the plaza. The space is large and bright, very clean and the food and service are outstanding.

The service is extremely gracious and friendly, we felt like we were VIP customers the entire time. Tea and water were filled regularly and they checked in once in a while to see if everything was ok, we were sitting there for about 2 hours and not once did we feel rushed or like they wanted us to leave. When we left, we even had one of the ladies rush to hold the door open for us. 

The food was amazing. I got a maki set which came with 6 California rolls and 9 golden dragon rolls and the price was $19. The rolls are gigantic, even the California rolls were impressive, they were packed with fresh ingredients and not a lot of rice was used which, for me, is a sign that a restaurant is going for quality over quantity. Most places stuff their rolls with rice and have tiny pieces of avocado and cucumber, etc... The salmon was fresh and when the food came my friend and I were shocked at how big the rolls were. Definitely big enough to share. 

My friend got one of the specials, it came with spicy salmon rolls, bulgogi beef and rice. Everything was fresh and well-prepared. 

Both of our meals came with miso soup, salad and another little bowl of soup with noodles. Part way thought our meal they also brought us some complimentary spring rolls which was nice even though we already had enough food for 4 or more people. No matter, I had a nice box of sushi to take home for the next day! 

Although it's not as cheap as other places in the area, the food and service far surpasses most, if not all sushi places in Richmond hill. I can't wait to go back and bring my family and friends!"}
{"text":"This is one our new go-to Japanese place.  Prices aren't the cheapest here but the portions are huge!  Came here once on a Friday night and waited for over 45 mins so I would suggest making reservations.

We've been here many times both take-out and eat in.  There's a good variety of dishes like Kalbi, Unagi don, Katsu, Sushi, Salmon Teriyaki, etc.  The only dish that I would not recommend is the ramen for $15 that lacked the typical ingredients/flavour of a traditional ramen that you can get at places like Sansotei.  We always get the salmon sashimi special (about 12 pieces) for $10!  And the Fantastic Roll is a must try!"}
{"text":"Good Sushi, big tasty rolls, you have a 20% discount between 3-5pm, will come back for sure."}
{"text":"This is honestly one of my favourite restaurants ever. I eat sushi a lot, and AOI is so, so awesome! 

I've come here for lunch and dinner many many times and every time I enjoy my meal thoroughly. The food quality is consistently amazing! 

Immediately upon entering you're greeted by friendly staff. There are little booths to sit in which gives you privacy from other people in the restaurant making the atmosphere comfortable and personal. 

The staff know my order so well now and ask if I want to see a menu or just stick with the usual. I always like to see the menu just in case, but I have my stable items. 

I love the crazy salmon roll which is deep fried and spicy, so delicious.

The salmon teriyaki is also so good! It comes out sizzling on a bed of veggies. It's juicy and so flavourful. 

Recently I tried the salmon lover roll and it was incredible. Torched salmon on top of a salmon- asparagus roll - unbelievably good. 

At lunch the salmon teriyaki bento box is my go to, and the salmon sushi is quite delicious as well. 

I always get free side dishes as well like salad and soups which is a really nice touch. Oh and from 3-5, your meal is 20% off (sashimi is 10% off), which is AWESOME! Looking forward to my next visit!!"}
{"text":"If you're like me who loves maki or rolls, then you must definitely visit this restaurant. This is probably the most impressive restaurant I've ever tried so far. 

The customer service in this restaurant is unparalleled. The server is super nice, very polite, she will answer all the questions you have about the menu, and will help you order by knowing your preferences. The server during that time surpassed my expectations in terms of customer service. 

We ordered volcano roll and caterpillar roll. The volcano roll was literally on fire when she delivered it to our table. The caterpillar roll was presented very well too that it resembles a caterpillar for real! Presentation was perfect and just too awesome.

The food was also very delicious! It is so fulfilling coz their maki is also bigger than most of the makis you will see in other restaurants. The price wasn't expensive too. 9 pcs volcano roll is around $15 and the 9pcs caterpillar roll is also around $15. 

The restaurant itself is a hidden gem. During weekdays lunch time you will find only few people eating. It is the perfect restaurant for me. I couldn't find anything negative to say in this restaurant. It is just the best restaurant ever!"}
{"text":"Located on Yonge street just south of Elgin Mills, Sushi Aoi is a cozy sushi joint that serves very high quality seafood for an above-average price. I ordered their sushi and sashimi dinner combo ($28) along with a Chirashi ($18), both of which came with their respective appetizers. The fish in both dishes were very fresh and served at the perfect temperature. Service was also top-notch! I'm not sure if this was because they saw me come in with a giant camera and watched me take pictures for a good 10 minutes before I started on my food, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. At one point, I purposely asked if the sushi and sashimi came with a bowl of rice knowing that it didn't. They politely explained to me that because the rolls and the nigiri already had rice, a bowl was not included. However, they added that they could add in an extra bowl for no additional cost. 

Overall, this was truly a great experience for me. If I had to pick one thing to complain about, it would be the price. This place is a little on the expensive side but the quality of food and service justifies it."}
{"text":"This is such a great sushi/japanese/korean food restaurant in Richmond Hill.  It used to be an Ichiban, but they've completely renovated and have new management.  The sushi is very good and prepared very well.  The quality is fresh and the presentation of the food is the best I've seen in Richmond Hill/Markham.  The service here is better than the service you will receive at any restaurant in the suburbs and is on par with a downtown restaurant (without the extremely high price tag).  I think the restaurant is family run, and you can really tell that the owners care about your experience and food.  Not even on Bay Street restaurants have I had the server walk me to the door and thank me for my business as I was leaving.  This is a fantastic restaurant and I hope they do well.


Edit:  they are under new management now.  It seems Sue the previous manager has left.  Their new sushi chefs aren't the best.  Rice is extremely mushy and rolls fall apart quite easily now."}
{"text":"3 star with 0.5 star for excellent service

Lunch Special at Sushi Aoi is decent with selection of both Korean and Japanese offering. I really enjoy their friendly and attentive service.

Sushi Lunch Combo B ($14) with 9 pcs of nigiri sushi and 6 pcs of maki sushi
The fish varieties was quite good. The California maki roll though was rolled really loosely. Just beware there is no wasabi in any of the pieces. As this is more like a Korean than a Japanese sushi restaurant.

The waitress was really nice and even offers me a spicy crab hand roll to try. And of course I was so full after eating all these (salad, soup, noodle).

I would be back for lunch and try out some of the cook dish next time."}
{"text":"This review is about a dinner experience on a weeknight.

My BF and I ordered a Wakame salad ($6), a Sushi & Ramen (in miso broth) combo ($22), and a Torched Rainbow Dragon Roll ($17).  Small salad, miso soup, noodle soup, spicy crab hand rolls, croquette, and fresh fruit were complimentary.  The Wakame salad was fresh and well portioned.  You could see how big it was in the picture.  The ramen had a nice bouncy and chewy texture, which I enjoyed much.  The miso broth was average.  It was drinkable.  The portion was great, as it was part of a combo, not a stand alone order.  The nigiri sushi was good.  The fish was fresh, they were sliced thick, and the rice to fish proportion was decent.  The torched rainbow dragon roll was impressive, and was my favourite of the meal.  The rice layer was thin.  The ingredients to rice ratio was high.  The ingredients were fresh.  The maki was sliced approximately 1cm thick.  The maki stayed intact tightly.  Nothing fell apart.  I was impressed by the skills.

Last but not least, the services was above and beyond expectation.  Only the floor manager was on duty this evening.  She was warm, effective, professional.  She paid attention if we needed water refills.  She offered to replace any item that we might find imperfect.  She always smiled.  I felt like I was having a special dinner date instead of just a regular dinner.  Her services would make the owner proud.

Near the end of the dinner, my BF and I had a 5-minute discussion on how many stars we should give Aoi based on the experience.  He called for 5 stars.  He couldn't find anything he could complain about.  I toyed between 4 to 5 stars.  And I knew I was being petty about what I found as imperfections.  *One* of the fish slices on the sushi, though was okay fresh, could be more fresh (yes, this is petty).  One out of the three types of ramen broth was not available, with this was a weeknight and all.  

We received good food and great value at Aoi.  If the fish quality, portion or craftsmanship get better, I wonder if the current price point would hold. 

Overall, 4.5 stars.  We will return.  Likely very soon."}
{"text":"First time went there, by a Yelp search. It is better than we expected. Service is nice and the two lunch menus we ordered were cooked well. A nice place we may go back more in the future."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! From the cleanliness of the bathrooms to the lovely, cozy decor and the little pillows surrounding each and every room around the restaurant, this place is a perfectly considered dining place without even talking about the food. Yes, not only is this place extremely clean (well, as it should be) it is also carefully considered. For me personally, I had a mouth issue after a dentist appointment and was more than surprised to see a tiny bottle of mouthwash as well as little paper cups nicely placed on the side of the bathroom, it made that particular visit just that much friendlier. As far as the food is concerned, this place also lives up to a five star standard. As a giant sushi lover, not only do I think this place offers some of the best nigiri/maki/sashimis out here in Richmond Hill due to the fresh ingredients (especially the fish) but I'm also surprised at the level of personality of the sushi hand made by the chefs. Not only are many of their sushi carefully dressed, the chefs at this place treats the sushi rice with a bit more sugar than average. Sure, not everyone appreciates sweetness in sushi but I found the extra sweetness in their sushi rice at least interesting. It says something about the chefs in terms of the level of improvisation and that their sushi aren't, if anything, boring.

To talk about some of the things that are imperfect, I want to mention that in one of the (at least ten) visits I had to sushi aoi had the situation where the rice felt a little dry and thus the rice was falling apart at times when I tried to put wasabi underneath the fish. However note that this happened only in one particular visit, and thus the quality of the food is fairly consistent, and quite good. And also another time the orders were (just only a little bit) messed up so we ended up getting the food quite late (not super late, but just 15-30 minutes later than usual) but that was probably due to the lack of certain ingredients as I've seen the chefs working tirelessly to fulfill all the orders. AND IN BOTH CASES the place showed very clear signs of apologies by giving us some extra dishes that were simply delicious. So they understood their problems and were not afriad to let go of a little more profit just to fulfill each customer's happiness. Truly remarkable. Obviously no one can be super perfect at all times, let's face it even moms screw up home cooking at times but you wouldn't hate on them would ya. And the level of interaction and consideration after mistakes is also one of a kind. For those reasons there's no justification to take out one star just for them to not be perfect.

And lastly, they offer a lot of free items! From the standards (miso soup and salad) to their own fried dumplings and little dishes of soysause noodles, this place is very generous for the amount you order. This place also offers oranges at the end of each meal. But obviously that changes from order to order so don't quote me on that for every order that you'll make.

Overall, thanks for the amazing service and the delicious sushi, as well as the lovely place."}

{"text":"Absolutely fantastic dishes.  I would go back again and again...Maybe tonight!!!  The taste and portion size were fantastic.  Yung was a great server.  He was friendly and attentive.   My coworker and I tried it out after we closed down our restaurant for the night and we're happy we did.  We will be back.  Try the volcano rolls.  They were amazing."}
{"text":"Dined here last night and both me and my partner got food poisoning. Also the older sushi chef was incredibly unprofessional. He kept yelling at his staff the whole time and waving his knife at them while he talked."}
{"text":"When Gonoe in Thornhill changed over to Gal's, it left a void in my \"goto\" Sushi place.  Gals just was too much with their nickeling and diming surcharges.  After A few of my Yelpie-Buddies recommended Sushi Aoi, I decided it's time to try them.

The place is near Elgin Mills on Yonge - in the same strip mall as Value Village and St.Louis Wings.  Plenty of parking and easy to find.

The place was an ACYE in the past and decided to re-tool and become a standard restaurant and it was a good idea.

They have plenty of specials, especially their AOI TIME in the mid afternoon.  I think is was 3-5PM or something like that and you get 20% of sushi and 10% off sashimi - If I remember properly.  They also have a great combos on the menu.

Their rolls are huge and they have generous cut sashimi.  Definitely a delight for the price.

Sushi Aoi is now my go to place in Richmond Hill.

Cheers!"}
