{"text":"We stopped by on a Sunday night and the bar had a decent number of customers but wasn't crowded.  There seemed to be only one waitress, and she had her hands full.  She was a bit curt at first but after we sat down she came over and was very polite.  I was truly impressed that she was able to single handedly service everyone who was eating that night.  We sat outside and the atmosphere was very nice. Service was prompt.  We ordered burgers; I had the blue moon burger, my husband had the pile driver and we ordered a large fries.  The fries were nothing to write home about (they were obviously pre-made frozen fries).  The burgers, were pretty good.  They came piled with cheese and they were a good size (1/2 lb.).  For the future I would ask for mayo on mine (the buns came dry) and lettuce and tomato (which cost extra and I forgot to ask for when we ordered).  At first I thought that the food was a little pricey but after realizing that the burgers are larger than Madison's typical 1/3 lb. it seemed to be reasonable.  I'm not much of a beer person, but they seem to have a rotating tap list with some good craft beers on it.  I was sort of on the fence between 3-4 stars but I'm going to go with 4 because I think if I place my order a little more carefully next time, it'll be a very good expierence."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoy the atmosphere and the awesome servers there. Food is always well prepared and their specials are awesome. I go there at least every other week just because they've always been consistently great in all aspects of their food and service."}
{"text":"I have been to Blue Moon many times and had good food, but my last trip there will be my last. I went there for lunch with two friends, and our lunch took an hour and a half. Fine for a weekend, but not so great when we all need to get back to work. It took us nearly 20 minutes to get our waters, and our lunch took at least 50 minutes. We had a turkey reuben, a Spanish chicken sandwich, a burger, waffle fries, and cheese curds, so nothing too fancy or that would take that long. I asked for a box three times, and when our server finally brought one, she dumped it on the table into a pile of ketchup. The food was good, as it always is, but the terrible service will keep me away."}
{"text":"I hate the fact that they didn't tell me it's cash only when I walked. This must be a scum! Never going back there"}
{"text":"Yum! The best quality vegetarian bar food I've had in a long time. We had the cheese curds and the (house made) blue moon veggie burgers with Cajun spice. Everything was fresh and filling, and our server was genuinely friendly and helpful. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot if I can't think of anywhere to go for a drink, cheese curds, a burger or to hang out with friends. I love being able to see the kitchen, the bartenders and waitstaff are friendly and accommodating, the food is good (my favorite curds in Madison) and a good beer selection!"}
{"text":"Don't go here.  A 31 year old woman, I showed my international documentation and told to \"go back to Spain and drink as much as I want there\".  I proceeded to reason with him in the most calm fashion and he demanded me to leave. Please don't support this xenophobic place. VIVA ESPANA"}
{"text":"Great bar-style food. Nice waitstaff. Could have a better atmosphere. Overall, a very satisfying experience that I would recommend. I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"The burgers were excellent,  perfectly done. Julie,  our server,  was very personable and attentive.  I would recommend blue moon to anyone looking for great burgers. Also,  a added plus, fantastic clam chowder"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a fish fry...it was  Amazing!! Even the service was  5* That happens once in a , Blue Moon :) I will be back! !!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly atmosphere. Great food. Nice selection of beers without having \"hundreds on tap\"."}
{"text":"Perfect for a late dinner. Food was amazingly fast and delicious. Staff was very accommodating. Rexommend!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great burgers, better cheese curds!  Great place to watch the game or bring family visiting from out of town.  Great bar atmosphere to enjoy every moment you are here.  Minus 1 star only because they dont accept credit/debit cards.  They do have an atm inside though."}
{"text":"Melt-in-your-mouth food...and close to my office! Bring cash, though...no plastic!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars. Simple. Straightforward. No foolin' around. Just good eats.  And, how Dotty Dumplings restaurant in Madison wins the best burger in town is beyond me.  Dotty . . . this is how you do it.   ** I also recommend the burgers at Monks Bar & Grill's too, which I'd give 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"A local favorite. And I can see why. Good burgers at a good price. Crinkle cut fries. A personal favorite. An impressive tap beer menu. Very casual with several TV's. Service was attentive and very friendly. This place is on my go to list.  Beware:  Cash only. But they do have an ATM with all of the charges."}
{"text":"Awesome beer but Veggie burger tastes nasty. A hint of curry, thyme, not sure here but kinda strange and Not a good experience. 1 of 5 stars. At most. A few years ago ur veggie burger rocked !! Please change ur recipe back. Ill be back then!"}
{"text":"Chicken cordon bleu was real good. I noticed they get their meat for the hamburgers from a local butcher which is always a good sign that the restaurant cares about quality food. They also had a very impressive beer tap selection. They do not except credit cards. After we got the bill no one came back to collect the money so I went up to the bar to pay. Looks like a good place to get your drink on"}
{"text":"We had a BOGO Bucky book coupon and decided to stop here after our activities.   We sat on their nice outdoor seating area in front of the building.   Our server came out almost immediately. They have an impressive tap and bottle list of beers.   We ordered the Blue moon burger,  The best burger in town,  small basket of fries, and a pear cider beer.  Total was $20 with coupon and tip.   We wanted the large basket but the server said the small is large enough for two.   The burgers didn't take long to arrive at our table.  The parties are impressively thick for a pub burger ( think Red Robin and not Culvers), served on crispy, golden kaiser rolls,  with pickles on the side.   The burgers were juicy and tender cooked at medium. It was very good and you could tell these were freshly formed before being fried on the grill.   The size of the fries were enough for both of us for this meal,  no leftovers.  They were just crinkle cut fries.  This place is an institution and I can see why. Definitely would come back here again!  Tip: they do not accept credit cards but there on ATM inside and they accept local checks."}
{"text":"Great pick of the day for lunch.  Burger was one of the best I have every had in the Madison area, perfect med...nice wait-staff at the bar (good personality, attentive - but not all over me).  Because of time commitment, had to take some to go...what service, got boxes and bagged up with napkins and all.  Highly recommend, wish I did not have to go back to work so I could have had a few pints."}
{"text":"The Blue Moon is a nice laid-back neighborhood bar that is a comfortable place to meet up after class or on a weekend afternoon to watch the game and play a little pool.  I used to frequent the place regularly when I lived a few blocks away in my college days, but now that I'm out in Middleton I don't get back that often.  A place like the Blue Moon is a good decision when it's only a few blocks from your place and even better when it's on your way home after class, but it's not exactly a destination you would make a special effort to get to.    The bar has a fairly comfortable layout, with a smallish ell-shaped bar up front with an open grill at the end.  Past the bar is an open area with tables and stools.  There is a staircase near the front door, and I prefer to go upstairs whenever there aren't seats at the bar.  There is a pool table upstairs and an assortment of boothes and tables, some overlooking the open ceiling to the areas below.  If you go on a busy night (Fridays or Game Days are generally packed) it can be difficult to find a seat.  The atmosphere of the place is always pretty relaxed, and it is true that the jukebox is not very good.  Fortunately it isn't set at ridiculously loud sound levels like many places in Madison, so it's easy to escape the hair metal by going upstairs or to the end of the bar.  There's a good deal of TVs showing a variety of games, and it was always one of my favorite places to go on Sunday to watch a variety of football games while shooting pool with my friends.  I saw that there were a couple of tables out on the sidewalk the last time I was there, which should be pretty nice on warmer months.  The menu at the Blue Moon is a bit light, focusing on mostly sandwiches and appetizers with a special Friday fish fry.  There are usually daily lunch and dinner specials which do round out the selection a bit more.  When in season I highly recommend the chili, and the soup appears to be homemade and is usually good.  As for the sandwiches, most of my friends find the burgers good and I can't disagree.  My favorite is the Spanish, which is a burger with pepperjack, pico and olives.  There's also a burger called the Piledriver that my friend used to get that was egregious in size - a half pound burger with ham, onions and like 3 different cheeses.  The angioplasty comes separate, and you've gotta go across the street for that.  Last Friday we went because my friend wanted the fish fry, and I decided to try the cajun chicken sandwich.  It was fairly standard but well seasoned.  The tap selection at the bar is good, with a couple of Capitals and Spotted.  I've never gotten a cocktail but the bar seems decently stocked.  I also remember that in college they used to have cans of Blatz for 75 cents, which brought me in like a moth to a flame on those lean days before payday.    The service is generally pretty quick.  Last Friday at the height of the fish fry rush we waited a bit to order but our drinks came quickly.  The bartenders have always been friendly, as have the regulars.  The place is a solid 3.5 stars, and if the menu were a bit broader or the jukebox less crappy I'd definitely give this place a four.  It's not a flashy place and the food isn't gourmet by any means, but that isn't something you look for in a neighborhood bar anyways.  The Blue Moon plays the part well, and for that I always like to stop by when I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Blue Moon to me means big, sloppy burgers - in the best way possible. They aren't afraid to cook a burger like you request it (i.e. actually leave the center pink if you wish!). Blue Moon uses real cheese, thick slices, and huge chunks of bleu cheese on their signature burger. It's in the details. If you want onion, boy will they give you onion. Onion rings are substantial size (thin rings annoy me) and they are totally worth ordering. Fries are disappointing, floppy, and a little bland. Cheese curds are bomb. In general, the menu is concise and desirable. I appreciate this since I don't normally love bar food. When I want it, this is the type.  Blue Moon is cash only, so plan ahead. There's a pool table and it's two stories for additional seating. Lunch time, it gets really busy so this is helpful. In the Mad City Cocktail book too!"}
{"text":"You know, I have a knack of always managing to sit by the scary, crazy guy when I dine alone. I was really, really, really hoping that this would only be a CA thing and that other states would not bring me this problem.  No. I really do have a talent of sitting by crazy people...nationwide. So, despite the fact that I was flanked by a drunk who was obsessed with both his fake knees and trying to sue corporate America, a photographer who kept trying to smoke me out, a professor who fancied fine scotch and corrected my grammar, and two girls singing Meatloaf....well...guess that tells you about the culture now, doesn't it?! Pretty fun place that's not overwrought with drunk college students becuase it's a little bit of a distance from campus.  Milwaukee, a little over an hour from Madison, is a beer-drinker's city. I hate beer; but it is important to mention that a lot of beer comes from WI. Mind you, it's mostly Pabst, Schlitz, and stuff of that caliber. But there are also some fine WI staples and microbrews....Spotted Cow coming up the most....many of which are on tap here. That said, I was both surprised and impressed that Sierra Nevada was also on tap here.   But, it's not a trip to Wisconsin without indulging in what they do best, fried cheese curds. If you've never had them, imagine fried mozzarella...but much better. They were pretty good here; but I wish they came with marinara sauce instead of (or in addition to) ranch.  Bar staff is pretty cool."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good place. Nice burger selection. We split a blue moon burger and an order of cheese curds. You get A LOT of curds so you could even split an order among 3 or 4 people. The burger was tasty, almost like a loose meat burger. I liked it.   They have tables downstairs and 3 booths upstairs. The booths aren't particularly comfortable. But it had a light airy atmosphere and I would come back again."}
{"text":"I finally got back for the burger so I will leave my food review now. The burgers are made with fresh ground beef that you can smell in the air. Lots of people with children were eating mixed with adults consuming drinks.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger rare with raw onion, cheddar and pickle. The burger was cooked perfect rare with a thick slice of cheese. As a pickle lover I thought the pickles were bland and boring. The bun was the bummer of the good burger because it was dense and hard compared to the soft versions of most craft burger places.  The fresh ground beef burgers didn't match the crappy frozen onion rings we were served and why do fresh beef and frozen sides anyway.   Overall the burger is on the good side but it does need a little work because it's not far from a great burger and that's a shame."}
{"text":"Great little place. Friendly staff. Good food.   I decided on the mushroom and Swiss veggie patty with a side of fries. My dinner date had the Reuben, and we shared an order of fried mushrooms. Our food literally came out within five or six minutes, was steaming hot, and fresh fresh fresh. I've never had food come out that fast, but I'm not complaining.   One of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. I'm skeptical of ordering them when out for dinner, because I've noticed a lot of times they are just frozen Boca patties and the edges get all hard and inedible when cooking. But these are fresh and made at the Blue Moon. Not exactly sure what they are made with, but oh so tasty. The mushrooms were juicy and the Swiss was gooey and melty.   I didn't try a bite of the Reuben but it looked so good! Heaping piles of meat on toasted rye. Smelled pretty dang good too .... Our fries were perfectly salted and hot. We shared a small basket, which is PLENTY for two people. And the fried mushrooms were yummy, served with a side of ranch.   We came later in the evening on a Saturday night. There was a nice crowd but we got a table right away. Our server was prompt and friendly.   Will definitely return for some more!  Oh, this is a CASH ONLY BAR. They have an ATM but just a heads up so you don't have to pay the ATM fee."}
{"text":"This place is an old U. Ave. staple, around and good since before there was social media!  I have visited twice in the last few months. The overall vibe is very low key, and some may call the interior slightly 'used and abused.' However, the excellent pub food and vast beer selection more than make up for the aging interior. In both of my recent visits, cheese curds and a burger fed my hunger. I'd rank the cheese curds among the best - nothing flashy, not too greasy, ample cheesiness. I had the Blue Moon burger during both trips as well - the burger was a little overcooked, but still delicious; ample blue cheese and raw onions on a nice fluffy-ish bun.  Since before I can remember, Blue Moon has been a cash-only establishment....and still is - so be prepared! (There is an ATM on site...though I am sure there's a nice fee associated with using it)"}
{"text":"This is a weird semi-suburban scene filled with odd looking single professional thirty-somethings, made all the more weird by the fact that this is a really small demographic in Madison (small gene pool)."}
{"text":"As a \"burger conneisuerur (sp),\" I have to vote this one the best in Madison. Out of the way and not on the radar of most people, looks like a divey hole in the wall. The best is the Blue Moon Burger, but the mushroom swiss is delicious too. If I had one suggestion, it'd be more bun variety with customer option. I like a softer bun in general so that the patty flavor overwhelms everything else."}
{"text":"This place wasn't bad. But it was far from great. Good beers on tap and fine service. The walleye had the nasty skin on it and hard to remove. Probably should have gotten a burger instead. Probably won't be back because there are so many other great places in Madison. Also, they only take cash. Granted, they have an ATM, but that costs an addition 2 bucks. Not really worth the hassle."}
{"text":"I know everybody says it,  but they have great burgers.  And just as impressive,  they have individually wrapped gluten free buns for free!!! If they had more options for gf sides, I'd give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down best place In Madison to get a burger! My boyfriend and I order to go at least once every two weeks. It's almost like clock work, after the first bite my boyfriend always says blue moon makes a true American burger. They do it the way it's supposed to be done. Yumm!"}
{"text":"Good beer!  Open late!  Also enjoy the cheese curds and burgers.  On a nice afternoon, there are a few tables right outside - perfect for happy hour.  (Just watch for the skateboarders and runners on the sidewalk!)   ATM inside.  Quick, friendly service."}
{"text":"Blue Moon is a neighborhood bar that makes great burgers and cheese curds. Portions are large and good for sharing.  The decor is a little dated, but that isn't the reason to go. They only take cash, but at least there is an ATM in the building."}
{"text":"We were at a badgers game and were hungry for some wings and a burger. They did not disappoint. The wings were crispy and tasty. My husband said the burger was the best he ever had. We also ordered seafood bisque which was more like chowder - thick and tasty.  The bar tenders were helpful and friendly. The service was fast. We defiantly will enjoy this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Very diverse menu. Super fun staff!  Beer menu changes often. Always something new to try!   Check it out!"}
{"text":"Food is fine and beer is pretty standard. Atmosphere - eh. Cash only is pretty annoying. Waitstaff just doesn't really seem to care the twice I've visited. I'm sure they do just fine with their regular crowd. Good for them. I pass."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of character, great beer and excellent food. I had one of if not the best Reuben ever. The food is home made. The clam chowder has real clams and thankfully, they were not rubbery but rather cooked to perfection. I highly recommend Blue Moon Bar & Grill when in Madison, WI."}
{"text":"Best. Burger. In town. Period. It's a cash-only establishment, gets crowded on weekend nights (Friday-Saturday) and with very good reason: their burgers rock and their other food is fantastic.   Servers are always friendly, food is served fast, and the burgers are huge. There is a great variety of sides available, several different toppings for your burger, and their specialty burgers are delicious.   This is the best burger in town."}
{"text":"Not only Madison's best burger, but a killer veggie burger. No joke. Order it with poco de gallo and Monterey Jack."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood type place.  Good and good-sized burgers.  Fries and chicken strips pretty good too.  Friendly staff, kid friendly on a Monday evening, though the place is not especially kid-oriented.  Our 4 year old enjoyed the Batman & Robin pinball machine upstairs.  No plastic accepted, ATM on-site."}
{"text":"You lucky SOBs... If the Blue Moon was in my hometown they would great me by name when I strolled in.   The other reviewers are spot on great burgers, nice beer selection, drinks are heavy pours, and the service is efficient and friendly.. Oh and the prices are more than reasonable... My client said that the Friday fish diners are awesome...   I stopped by with a colleague for a nightcap and we were quickly wishing we went here for dinner... So we decided to stop by for lunch the following day...  My pepper jack cheeseburger with fried onions was cooked perfectly Med. Fries were old style and not greasy at all. Our server made sure our ice teas were always topped. Checking out the piles of food being delivered to other diners and the empty plates being returned confirmed that the Moon has got it going on..  A definite return visit when I return in May...."}
{"text":"I lived right around the corner from Blue Moon for 2 years and visited so frequently my fiance and I were invited to go on the bar trip to a Brewers game. So my perspective is that of a regular, albeit one on the younger end of the spectrum.  Blue Moon has everything I love about a neighborhood bar, and then some. Their rotating list of beers is impressive enough for my beer snob friends to want to visit, but they still have your standard Miller Lite on tap, and the prices are reasonable/affordable. Drinks and wine are significantly cheaper than the bar across the street. And the food is good! I think they have the best ruben in town, good waffle fries, a HUGE brat, and generally good soups/specials. While I'm sure not all the items are 5 star generally anything they're making on the grill is good.  I've gotten to know most of the staff over time and am always treated well. That being said, I could see how someone new to the bar might get the impression of ambivalent service. Also, there are a number of REGULARS that hang around talking and can get a bit sauced. For me, that's all part of the atmosphere of the neighborhood bar, but if you are looking for something a bit more high brow, maybe this isn't your regular spot."}
{"text":"I'm with Kate all the way on this place. It's a great bar to hang out with some of your cronies upstairs and get a burger. Some of the clientele scared me at times and yes, the jukebox is a myriad of classic rock. And oddly enough, the crowd doesn't really vary from the day to the night. I only discovered this place after living down on University which was a shame, but I'm glad I got here while I could."}
{"text":"Love it!!! Great food!!! Ordered cheese curds, Reuben and BLT--the best ever!!! Good service and great ambiance!!! Recommend to anyone visiting Madison, WI!!!!"}
{"text":"Selected the \"lake perch\" for Friday dinner.  Delicious!  Cole slaw was in very large chunks and not particularly tasty.  Nice dinner roll, but who needs bread and french fries.  Great, efficient waitress.  Very, very casual dress. A bit loud.  This is not the place for a quiet Friday night dinner, but it's a fairly good fish fry.  They don't take credit cards, but they have an ATM."}
{"text":"My wife and I traveled to Madison for the first time for her conference and had no idea what to expect. We've had good times in Milwaukee, but Madison is something special. Our hotel was a block away from the Blue Moon Bar and we needed to grab some food and drinks after the drive up.   We walked over and found a neighborhood bar that had good music, was clean, and had a cool pinball section upstairs. We were met at the door and taken to a booth upstairs.   We ordered the cheese curds and burgers and a couple beers. The beer selection is quite good and of course New Glarus is on the menu. We thoroughly enjoyed the food and were quite happy with the price, coming from Chicago.   All in all, I would go to this bar/restaurant all the time if I live nearby. Unpretentious, delicious, and inexpensive. Check it out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Definitely a mixed crowd as stated before.  Decent food, a nice place to watch the game that is on that day.  Not a place where I am a regular, but there seem to be the same faces every time I walk by...weird. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Great fish fry, Had the 3 piece cod for $10. Was served large pieces. Large tap selection although taps were pricey $4. Place was off the hook at 7 on a Friday evening. Waited 25 minutes for a table. My friend had the Cajun burger and he said it wasn't spicy despite what the menu said. This place has a neighborhood bar feel.   I will be back."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a salmon burger. I had been so used to salmon burger patties that when I saw the big salmon fillet on my burger I knew this was going to be my favorite spot. It's walking distance from my place and nearby other restaurants to try in the area, which also makes it a nice stop to grab a brew and sit outside on a nice day.  I specifically like coming here on Fridays for their Friday Only Seafood menu. Their seafood soup was filled with shrimp, mussels, clams, etc. and just right for the price $8. They also have a good selection of beers on rotation.   It can get rather packed, but they have tons of seating upstairs with an arcade area in case you got the kiddos."}
{"text":"I spent two years across the street while in graduate school at UW-Madison, the better of those years frequenting this fine establishment. The burgers are delicious, the staff is responsible and courteous and the bartenders the damn best you'll find.  I've moved since those days and have yet to find a place with the same atmosphere the Blue Moon provides. I miss the burgers almost as much as I miss the people. Hope all is well Madtown!"}
{"text":"Stayed from it of town, the bar was recommended by the hotel. Great vibe at the bar, however, someone please tell their servers to smile or laugh or to pretend they aren't so unhappy! I could barely bring myself to tip the two gals working tonight because they were such Debbie downers"}
{"text":"Great bloody Mary's!  Very quaint and everyone was very friendly. Did not have anything to eat but the place was busy for a Friday afternoon so food must be decent."}
{"text":"I somehow found my self here two times in one week and both experiences were great. The hostesses were polite and efficient and the bartender was very well knowledge on any questions we had on the beer. I really appreciate the managers letting us have our little event there, as I know we were extremely rowdy. Even with us being loud and obnoxious it did not stop the customers one bit, which tells you how awesome Madison can be. The food was great and the beer was awesome."}
{"text":"I went for an \"extended\" 8 mile walk on Saturday afternoon, post-Badgers of course.  My exercise brought me from Weston Place, downtown to pre-Freakfest activities  and back home again, but not without a stop at the Blue Moon Bar & Grill.  I had been once before, but we a couple of locals looking only to add to a five hour buzz.  This time was different and boy I am happy I stopped.  The beer selection is great.  Not to many, not too few.  The bartender (I think Jim) was very knowledgeable on beer as I asked for a malty, strong beer and he delivered with a Karben4 Lucky Lady Red Ale.  The atmosphere was definitely bar, but upscale slightly based on the clientele.    I was only stopping for one beer when I struck up a conversation with a delightful gentleman who recommended the burgers.  Being it was 7 o'clock and I was working on toast and 3 beers for the day, I decided on the mushroom and swiss burger would hit the spot....and it did not disappoint....definitely one of the best burger I have had, period.  Of course another beer was needed....and then I called it a night as I still had a mile walk ahead of me.  I highly recommend a stop.  Don't be afraid that if looks like a neighborhood bar; it is and much more.  Everyone was friendly and the bartender was excellent.    In the overused words of Arnold....\"I'll be back\"  I am out!"}
{"text":"Great little dive. Don't expect anything too classy. You won't get it. You will get pretty good food for a good price. I ordered the Best Burger in Town. That turned out to be not true. Burger was a mess. Tomatoes and half a head of lettuce made it impossible to pick up and eat. There burger itself was cooked beyond recognition of flavor. I would not order the Best Burger. Cheese curds were quite good. Great selection of beers. Seems like a perfect place for a drink. Not so sold on the food"}
{"text":"I like the burgers, cheese curds, and darts at this bar.  But only really if I'm there with a bunch of friends and we're dominating the upstairs loft area.  The juke box is unfortunately sucky."}
{"text":"Blue Moon is the local watering hole where you go to watch a game, grab a beer and get something greasy to chow down on, perhaps all at the same time. I've been here for all three of those reasons, and I think the place is best used in that order. The atmosphere is perfect for chilling with a group of friends to watch the game. You're surrounded by like-minded individuals, who cheer and despair in sync with every beat in the game. I guess places like Blue Moon is the much tamer American version of the rowdy British pubs where Liverpool losing to Manchester is a reason to call riot police. The beer is also decent. Modest selection of beers, both on tap and bottled. I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I do know that this isn't the largest beer menu available to the beer-happy Madison population, so keep that in mind. Finally, the food is decent though not spectacular. I personally find their cheese curds the best that I've had thus far, but the really bland burger makes it not fun. They seem to know how to cook a burger correctly (they got my medium rare burger closer to medium rare than any other burger I've had in Madison), but it's seriously lacking in salt and spice.   Based on the description above, I would say that only warrants three stars, but I'm going to bump it up a star because 1) I like the really chill ambiance, and 2) the service was excellent. The waitress took my order very fast, the food came out promptly, and checked in on me regularly. Overall, a really relaxed place, somewhere to go just to hang out after a long day."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night for drinks with friends. Decent beer selection with some different beers that you don't often see in other bars. The brown shugga was my favorite! We also tried the cheese curds and they were delicious. The guy next to me had a burger and it smelled delicious...almost to the point that I was likely looking his way more often than is socially appropriate. The bartender was attentive and made small talk with us every now and then. He did a nice job providing entertainment without being nosy or intrusive. We will likely be back to try the food!"}
{"text":"Heads up.. This is a cash only bar/restaurant.   I came here on a Monday night to meet a friend around 6pm and the place was packed. We were lucky to snag a spot at the bar. The food smelled great so we decided to order a quick bite to eat before heading out.   I ordered a bacon cheese burger with grilled onions, and my friend ordered a chicken sandwich with a side of waffle fries. My burger was HUGE for the price! When it came time to eat, it was next to impossible to pick it up. I had to ask for a fork to finish eating it because the burger was falling apart. Overall the burger was very moist and not over cooked, it just didn't have any flavor. The side of waffle fries was huge, like a whole heaping basket full huge! My friend said she enjoyed her chicken sandwich.  Some of the reasons why I am giving this place 3 stars.  - Limited beer menu (I prefer craft beers and they didn't have a great tap selection). - Crowded and loud (it does make for good people watching though) - Parking can be a pain (they do have a parking lot but most of the time it's full) - The food (mainly burgers need some seasoning)"}
{"text":"Its a Wisconsin bar.  Lighting is pretty bad, space isn't that comfortable but the beer and bar food get the job done, I guess.    Service is...well, its a bar.    Burger is ok but definitely NOT worth the hype.    The whole place could use an update."}
{"text":"It's a typical small Wisconsin bar with seating on two levels. Sparse and a little stark in the decor. Our server was friendly and the food came quickly and was done just as we ordered.  Three of us had the bleu burgers with sautéed onions instead of the raw.  Lots of bleu cheese in these.  Very juicy. Good buns. Over all - a very good burger! We also had the battered cross-cut fries, the jalapeno poppers, and the cheese curds. I didn't think those were anything particularly outstanding."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Average bar in Madison conveniently located near the hospital. It's a dark and dingy place where you should be prepared to show your ID. Drinks of course are typical. We also tried food: mushroom and swiss burger, ribs special (that comes with onion rings) and fried cheese curds. The fried cheese curds were fantastic and decently priced (truly the star of the show). Burger was also delicious (just a note that tomato and lettuce are extra). The ribs special was really disappointing though (definitely made better at home). Tasted like pork slathered in sauce. The onion rings were decent and crispy (the batter was kind of thick though). Overall not a bad place to stop by. Stick to the menu and not the special on the board maybe."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Madison. Their Long Islands are fantastic (ahem, strong) and they have a great beer selection. Everything I have ever eaten there has been delicious. I especially love the fish fry and clam chowder. The staff is friendly and attentive and I love their upstairs seating area. There is a pool table in the middle but also cozy corner booths if you fancy some privacy. I will keep coming back to Blue Moon over and over again!"}
{"text":"ate a damn good meal here last week.. indulgent to the max, but quite the welcome to madison... burger, cheese curds, spotted cow. recipe for success!"}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of friends and we had a pretty weird experience. As we sat down at our tables, the waiter asked to see all of our IDs saying that this was a 21+ bar. Now I'm not sure if this is true but it was unsettling nonetheless. One person was literally asked to leave the bar because she did not bring her ID. Needless to say this didn't really set the mood for a great evening.  I ordered their soup of the day which was okay. The burgers here looked delicious, if I do come back I will definitely try one of them. Overall, it's a nice ambience, but our experience here really rubbed me quite the wrong way."}
{"text":"Best Cajun burger maybe ever.  Solid mushroom Swiss burger and fish fry.  Plenty of TVs to watch sports.  About 12 quality beers on tap and a decent selection of scotch. Pool table and booths up top. great local bar."}
{"text":"Nicely remodeled Wisconsin neighborhood bar with great food. Be sure to try their BLTs and hamburgers. FF cheese curds are great too."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible burgers and good, friendly service.  Outside of maybe Dotty's, I challenge anyone to find a better burger in Madison."}
{"text":"Got carded for ordering a sandwich at 6pm on Wednesday night (had no intention of drinking, merely there for food) and was told it was \"state law\" I couldn't be in there if I was under 21 (?) First time this was EVER enforced or mentioned out of the multiple times I'd been there.  It would be basic courtesy to post a sign on the door if this is in fact your policy. To be fair, most people probably should have their I.D.s on them but I'm just turned off from ever coming back based on the inconsistency and flat out lies. First and only time I've gotten carded for water and a sandwich. Lol?"}
{"text":"Went to Blue Moon after hearing tons of good things about the joint and it did not disappoint. This place is in no way a fancy restaurant- but that makes it all the better. It's a great place to grab a casual lunch, some beer and play some arcade games. Ordered the blue moon burger and cheese curds and they were both absolutely delicious. Would definitely come back here again. My only regret is I didn't come hungrier because the portions are HUGE!"}
{"text":"Ugh. A cash-only restaurant/bar. Fortunately, they proudly offer an ATM that only charges $3. I cannot believe this sh!thole is still in business. The food is mediocre and the beers are way too much ($6.50). Do yourself a favor and skip this place. Go across the street to Lombardinos or down the street to Barriques."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and this is one of the closest you will ever get to a local Madison dive bar.  It is clearly made up of mostly locals but the staff is very friendly.  As soon as we entered a waitress greeted us and started us off with some drinks.  As far as beer goes, they have a HUGE selection of craft and local beers.  They have a decent bar menu, with a significant emphasis on burgers.  I ended up getting the \"best cheeseburger\" and was pleasantly surprised.  It is a thicker burger than usual, but has excellent flavor.  The bread is soft with almost and artisanal quality to it with a crispy inside and soft fluffy outside.    Overall a great place to grab a beer, burger, and watch a game.  The only warning I will pass along is CASH ONLY!!!!  That is that part I hate.  I never have cash, and they have an ATM which charges $3-4 just to withdraw money.  I mean seriously it is 2018, charge an extra .50 cents on the burgers and please accept credit cards!!!"}
{"text":"Best fried cheese curds ever! Great place to grab drinks and appetizers after work.  Limited parking, especially late afternoons/early evenings. Carpool might be best!"}
{"text":"I half expected everyone to yell \"Norm!\" as people walked in because everyone seemed to know each other. The bar had a real homey feel.   The bartender was awesome and had the gift of gab.   Burgers, wings, cheese curds and more are available, if you need a bite.   Prices were good."}
{"text":"This is a State Steet type of bar that is not on state.  Cheap tap beers, typical bar food.  It may be time for an update and some new menu items....."}
{"text":"Perfect Friday afternoon happy hour spot! Delicious cheese curds, salty crinkle cut fries and some friendly competitive pinball with colleagues.   Blue Moon is a classic Wisconsin bar.  Being cash only throws us millennials who don't carry cards off, but luckily there's an ATM located inside."}
{"text":"Nice joint, brings back so many memories. I used to come to this bar when it was called Merk's; talk about a throwback !! When was that, like 30 years ago ????! Sheesh, not gettin any younger, but the staff and atmosphere here are definitely warm and welcoming. Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Speaking as someone who does not eat meat ever/very often, I am not impressed with the food as my options are extremely limited.  I am impressed with the atmosphere and beer selection. If  I lived closer, I'd hang out here."}
{"text":"Good fast service with reliable bar basics. The prepped counter says it all. They are beer and solid bar basket food."}
{"text":"Good local style pub, we went after my son made weight for the state wrestling tournament.   Appetizers: cheese curds & mushrooms were good. Clam chowder was a touch to salty for our taste. But the large chunks of clam meat and perfectly cooked potato and onion were great.  Main dish: it's Friday and your in Wisconsin and it's lent. So we got the fish fry!!!!! It was very good, we all had the cod. The coleslaw was good and I really enjoyed that it had the caraway seeds in it.   Only negative was the fish fry could have had a larger serving of fish."}
{"text":"I returned to the Blue Moon recently for a fun beer sampling event and I had a great time--bring your cash though, otherwise you will pay an ATM fee or rely on a friend.  The service was attentive at the bar and at the tables and the food came up in good time.  There was a good selection of beers on tap that were smaller breweries or seasonal pulls and others in bottles/cans.  I didn't eat this time around though!  I will say that sitting at the high bar stools at the bar and table became weary for my lower back by the end of the evening so I was happy to get up and mingle at the event.  The outdoor seating is regular chairs and tables rather than high-tops though and there are some booths on the upper level too.    Upstairs, they have a set of fun, themed pinball machines that were more fun than expected.  The group did a tournament style competition and while it took awhile to get the whole group through it was fun to try my hand at a game I hadn't played in awhile!  The trick was to feed money enough for 3 turns and then the 4th was free.  Also, some of the machines have slots for dollar and others don't but there is a change machine on the second level near the pinball machines.  This worked well for the group and other times I've visited, it works well for smaller gatherings as well."}
{"text":"I truly love the Blue Moon. It is just a couple blocks from my place and I can stumble home when I'm done. They are always swapping out beers and replacing them with the hip beer, but they maintain a few essentials. I really love their vegetarian burgers, especially in the mushroom and swiss burger. It gets pretty loud during UW games but otherwise it's really easy to find a seat with your group."}
{"text":"I'm on the constant search for the best blue cheese burger (bacon preferred), and the Blue Moon Burger (add the bacon) just landed the #1 spot. It is awesome.   Be aware, cash only, but ATM on site. Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Food was good but they didn't take credit cards so I had to withdraw cash at the ATM inside the bar and pay a $3 fee for it."}
{"text":"A popular s/p shift bar for hospital employees, this bar is a great place to recover after 12 hours of taking care of other human beings. Good food, decent tap selections and always friendly bar staff.  I don't know that I'd make a special trip to the neighborhood to check it out, but I'll usually eat there when I'm in the area for other reasons."}
{"text":"First time here. Bleu moon burger was AWESOME!  Fries were good -- taste like they're cooked in very fresh oil. Love the dipping sauce- got the 1000 island. Cole slaw was nice and crunchy.  Service was friendly and efficient. Plan to make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"This place is within my top 5 favorite burger places right now! Well-priced drinks, and an awesome after-work atmosphere whether it's in the morning, afternoon, or late night shift! Their Bacon Cheese Burger, although a main stream favorite, is perfectly done!"}
{"text":"This was not my first trip to Blue Moon but was the first time I tried their burgers. I went with the Blue Moon Burger (blue cheese burger) with bacon. The burger patty was huge. It was juicy and seasoned well. They did not skimp on the blue cheese and the bacon was a nice addition. Add a slightly toasted bun and you've got a great burger.   The fries were nothing special and were an additional order. The staff was very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I still remember the classic Moe story on this establishment.  There was a BABY SHOWER in the bar once.  A BABY SHOWER... YES.  And many a time there are post wedding parties, with a bride in a wedding dress playing pool.  Which comes to the reason why I go.  Yes, there's a pool table.  And while I SUCK at the game (ungodly I know, given my excellent geometry skills), there's something about having a tough day at work, and going to the bar, a bucket of fries, mozz sticks and jalapeno poppers, a corona, and pool.  Many rave about the Blue Moon burger (husband included).  However, this comment is lost in a vegetarian like me, even if there ARE veggie burgers...   This is the kind of bar where... everybody knows your name...  Jukebox is ok.  They show football games (if you're interested in this kinda thing, which I\"m not, but who are we kidding I live in WI)...  And well... it's the local neighbourhood bar, close to home... :)"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I have been here multiple times now and havent been disappointed yet. They have an array of tasty dipping sauces, outstanding soups, sandwiches, and fish fry. I would highly recommend anyone go here anytime they are hungry (or thirsty ).   Word to the wise...tomato and steak bisque is one of the best soups I have ever had in my life. GGWP"}
{"text":"People and beer great. Service very good. Food-not so much. Bad cheese curds mediocre burgers. Nice bartender. Meh."}
{"text":"Food and service great- 4 outside tables CASH ONLY  It's a small place, not what I consider a steak house though."}
{"text":"I come here regularly and love every bartender I've had! The food is good for bar food as well! The prices are more than fair!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here the other day for a quick dinner and a beer with a friend. It was a Monday night and the place was pretty busy! We were still able to easily find a spot at the bar and that is where we chose to eat as well.   I went with the chicken sandwich. It was delicious! It's pretty hard to mess up a plain ol' chicken sandwich, but there is something to be said about the quality of the meat used. This was a big plump, perfectly cooked chicken breast. It was full of moisture and not at all dried out. It was very flavorful. It was served with a couple little packets of mayo on the side.   My friend went with a grilled onion cheeseburger. It was enormous!! She said it was very tasty. It looked great! It was a little greasy and started falling apart at the end so she was eating it with a fork. A burger isn't a good burger if it isn't a little greasy, amiright?   We split an order of french fries as well. The order was huge. I would recommend splitting if you're not super starving. They were really great, too. Nice and crisp.   Service was good. The beers were cold and fresh. The atmosphere was nice. Overall it was a nice experience. I had been in here before a handful of times, but this was my first time trying the food and I definitely was not disappointed."}
